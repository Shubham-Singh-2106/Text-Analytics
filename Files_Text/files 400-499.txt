Failure is a part of the learning process, says Lenovo's Shailendra
Katyal at TechSparks 2021

At TechSparks 2021, YourStory's flagship event, Shailendra Katyal, MD of
Lenovo PCSD India, reveals how the Chinese Fu Pan approach helped the
tech company reverse its fortunes and why founders must embrace failure
as part of the entrepreneurial journey.

Walking down the entrepreneurial road isn't easy; one often stumbles
upon unexpected roadblocks and dead ends.

It is extremely challenging to launch a business, and often herculean to
sustain it. So why do people willingly choose a path riddled with
unpredictability and sleepless nights? The determination to see one's
vision - be it a new product or service - come to fruition is common
amongst entrepreneurs.

That said, success is sweet but failure needs to be seen as a source of
learning.

"People should have an appetite for failure as well. No idea is unique.
It's only about who gets there first and executes better," said
Shailendra Katyal, Managing Director of Lenovo PCSD India, on Day 1 of
TechSparks 2021, India's largest and most influential
tech-entrepreneurship conference.

Speaking on the power of an entrepreneurial mindset, he focused on the
need for startup owners to accept failure as part of the learning
process.

Lenovo's growth journey

Lenovo's market share in 2003 was way behind that of other computer
companies like Dell, Hewlett Packard, and IBM.

But from 2005 onwards the company was able to accelerate growth and
acquire IBM's PC Business. It also formed a joint venture with Japanese
electronics firm NEC and acquired Medion, a German electronics
manufacturing company. In 2014, IBM's System x server business and
Google's Motorola Mobility were acquired by Lenovo.

How did Lenovo turn things around in just two to three years?

With Fu Pan.

The Fu Pan approach

Fu Pan is a Chinese term drawn from an ancient Chinese game, 'Weiqi' or
'Go', which translates to replaying the chess board, or analysing the
moves you've made so as to do better the next time.

Players replay an entire game on the chessboard after a match to break
down each move. This is mainly done to explore the dynamics of each
move, understand if something better could have been done, and learn
whether the outcome would have been different. The Fu Pan analysis has
its foundations in two things:

* Being critical of one's work and showing no mercy.

* Looking at failure as the end result of a process rather than the
failure of oneself.

This is essentially a process of learning where one steps out of their
comfort zone and reflects on mistakes made.

Shailendra, who heads Lenovo's PC and Small Devices Group in India,
says, "People often get emotional, and Fu Pan requires one to look at
processes with absolute objectivity."

It gives them the ability to look at one's actions and critique them.
Knowing that things could have been done in a better or more efficient
way requires one to separate one's performance from the self.

The entrepreneurial mindspace

The MD of Lenovo PCSD India says being able to make decisions quickly
yet rationally, while having a clear vision in mind at all times, and
possessing the ability to roll up the sleeves and work with any kind of
team are all key factors that contribute to becoming a good
entrepreneur.

"Every role has an element of operation and vision. But when one is the
leader or an entrepreneur, that becomes the primary job. Are they ahead
of the curve? Are they helping the organisation stay ahead of the
curve?"

"Entrepreneurs need to stay connected to the context and the
environment, and nurture the ability to pick up trends while sticking
one's neck out and taking a few risks," Shailendra said.

The need for predicting growth

Shailendra said peeling the onion at every stage of a journey is
important, "not just at the end of the year or at the end of a project".

Deep diving into every step of the process to figure out why something
worked or didn't is crucial to predict growth.

Many companies that experience hypergrowth in their nascent stages get
caught up and end up having to grapple with potentially serious problems
while scaling. "Predictability of growth and innovation to sustain are
both very crucial for a company that is growing," he said.

The DNA and culture of the organisation should be conducive enough for
people to share new ideas and knowledge, take risks, and upskill
constantly, Shailendra said.

Private equity fund as a vehicle for entrepreneurship

Government's 2022 Budget was anchored on the theme: &lsquo;Building
Sustainable Entrepreneurship'. This signals the high-priority of
entrepreneurship in the nation's economic plan as a pathway toward
solving the teeming unemployment. The unemployment statistics are quite
dire; notably a 32.8 percent and 19.7 percent unemployment rate among
the 15&ndash;24 and 15&ndash;35 year age brackets, respectively.
Nonetheless, with a 70 percent reported start-up failure rate in Ghana,
the &lsquo;sustainable' tag is quite apt, denoting a concerted focus not
just on entrepreneurship but, more importantly, addressing both the
systemic and company-specific factors that shorten the life-span of
businesses or limit their sturdy growth.Inadequate access to capital and
managerial failures are well catalogued as the dual-pronged dominant
factors leading to business failures in Ghana or limiting the
sustainable growth of businesses in the country. This report seeks to
examine a financing vehicle that serves the dual purpose of access to
capital and managerial solutions toward maximising it for business
start-ups and scale-ups in Ghana's economy.Common business funding in
the economyFormal business capital, beyond the enterprises' internal
funding, is fueled mostly by debt capital, with resident universal banks
and microfinance institutions being the main intermediaries in the
capital aggregation and subsequent transfer. Client deposits, by virtue
of intent, regulation and risk management, are largely deployed as loans
and also investments into low-risk assets.Nevertheless, the stock of
domestic credit in the nation's economy is on the lower band as signaled
by a 13.20 percent credit to GDP ratio for the 2020 financial year.

This pales in comparison to that of lower-middle income countries,
Sub-Saharan Africa and also the leading West African economies, as
attested by the graph below with data from the World Bank.This indicates
that although credit is significant in the capital structure of
companies, it is sub-par relative to the economy's size and economic
resources. However, the banks and the other credit intermediaries
commonly cite high risk as a key factor in the low credit regime, which
is invariably reflected in the high cost of debt capital. It is signaled
by average lending rates exceeding 20 percent in the 2021 financial
year, compared with a 6.6 percent average for the other five leading
economies in the West African sub-region. This is buttressed by the
highly informal profile of Ghana's business space, with an estimated 80
percent of the nation's workforce stemming from the informal sector. The
broad informal sector is mired in weak operational practices which have
a knock-on effect on the more formal entities, fusing to pose repayment
challenges on credits.Solving the credit problemThe universal banks and
most lending business models are primarily focused on extending debt
capital and undertaking risk mitigation strategies to strengthen
repayment. Thus, these creditors focus on near-term profitability and
emphasise strong cash flows for interest coverage and settlement of
principal. The high interest rate and near-term horizon, in addition to
security requirements, place a strain on the borrowing entities that
pass the credit checks, thereby limiting sturdy company growth over the
long-term. Companies in more speculative industries and phases of the
corporate life-cycle &ndash; such as start-ups, early-stage, and
distressed &ndash; have a lower priority in line with risk
management.Banks generally have deep technical expertise in various
lending sectors. However, this skill-set is utilised more for risk
mitigation strategies and debt executions for those sectors. Their
objective is not to grow businesses sustainably over the long-term or to
structure them into a stronger financial position, poised for a
long-term value surge.In essence, there is a missing piece; or aptly
put, though available, there's a deficiency of that piece needed to
complement the more common credit capital deployed in the economy, and
fitted with strategic solutions for the operational and managerial
challenges that confront businesses in the country.Is public equity
offering the answer?Equity capital, via public offering, is considered a
source of patient capital and an avenue for more risk-tolerant investors
with a long-term outlook. Nonetheless, investor enthusiasm is biased to
a large extent toward more established firms, underpinned by solid
fundamentals or with high growth prospects signaled by strong earnings,
or robust market share and more structured operations.This is
exemplified by the Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on the Ghana Stock
Exchange (GSE) over the past decade, with the successful ones satisfying
the aforementioned factors. (Notably Access Bank, ADB & MTN).
Additionally, listing regulations, albeit mainly skewed toward
investors' protection, provide a suite of rules, of which adherence
largely steers the Publicly Listed Companies (PLCs) into more structured
operations and sound corporate governance practices (which are
invaluable in corporate survival and growth).The GSE Alternative
Exchange (GAX) is more aligned for penny stocks of medium and
small-scale enterprises (MSMEs), early stage companies and entities with
speculative earnings. However, only 6 companies have listed equities on
the GAX since its inception, and with a sluggish post-listing price
outturn, this shows muted investor enthusiasm for those entities. This
affects the appeal of the GAX as an effective capital raising vehicle.Is
private equity to the rescue?Private equity (PE) funds are more
structured for value creation in long-term operations relative to the
near-term model of credit on debt coverage and somewhat volatile
sentiments of listed stock investors, swayed by near-term earnings and
price movements. Strategic utilisation of PE funds in Ghana's economy
should yield the needed benefits of more inclusive economic development,
sustainable job creation and attainment of key sustainable development
goals (SDG).PE funds are primarily pools of investments, seeking stakes
in non-public stocks, and in limited partnerships; the funds are managed
by General Partners (GPs) with unlimited liability, and funded by the
Limited Partners (LPs) with limited liability up to the threshold of
their investments. PE funds are alternative assets (along with real
estates and commodities, among others) and thus, their profile of
expected and required rate of returns, risks, tax provisions and
investment horizons among others, differ from the more mainstream and
traditional asset class of cash and cash equivalents, fixed income and
quoted stocks.Private equity in AfricaPE deals on the continent have
grown steadily in more recent times, with capital raised for
Africa-focused funds totalling US$18.1billion over the 2015&ndash;2020
period, as reported by the African Private Equity and Venture Capital
Association (AVCA) 2020 annual data tracker. North America and Europe
accounted for the majority of funds raised for the continent. Funds
raised in 2020 dipped substantially by 69 percent to US$1.25billion,
relative to 2019 with the COVID-19 pandemic being the major factor. 53
percent of the 2020 funds closed were committed into growth and buyout
funds, 40 percent for more early-stage venture capital, and 7 percent
for infrastructure funds. In the 2015&ndash;2020 range, 1,257 deals were
closed on the continent, estimated at US$21.7billion, with tech-enabled
entities accounting for 46 percent. The investors were mostly skewed
toward Financial, Consumer discretionary and Industrial sectors. A total
of 270 successful exits were recorded over the 6-year period. Trade
buyers led the exit pack, averaging an annual 41 percent over the
period, followed by PEs and other financial buyers.

However, the continent accounted for a minor share of global PE
investments, signalled by a 0.6 percent of the US$4.8trillion funds
raised from 2007 to the 2016 financial years.West Africa was the most
preferred region for deals execution, accounting for 23 percent and 21
percent of volume and value of transactions, respectively. Nigeria was
the most favoured for deals in the region, followed by Ghana, with the
two countries economies' size and strong consumer market being the chief
factors, while a stable political climate added to the latter's appeal.
South Africa was the most preferred for deal volume, constituting 18
percent which accounted for 9 percent of total value. This was based on
the nation's relatively more structured and larger economy, diverse
commodities and strong availability of experienced human resources. Over
the period, East Africa accounted for 16 percent and 10 percent of
volume and value of deals, respectively, with Kenya being the most
dominant in the sub-region, buoyed by its economy's size and deeper
financial intermediation.Ghana's case &ndash; the how of maximising the
PE vehicle.Ghana's economy, albeit in middle-class status, is mired in
key features of developing economies, such as high unemployment rate,
low per capita income, strong dependency on primary products and their
exports. The economy, although commodity-rich, still lies at the lower
base of production value chains; serving more as a cheap input supplier
in the global production cycle. This is at odds with the case in the
developed economies dominated by corporates which utilise these primary
commodities into more innovative and value-added products, thereby
growing into ultra-value titans, gracing the apex tiers of global
rankings such as Forbes. This, to a strong extent, is via patient
funding such as PE funds, with subsequent public listings or trade
sales, among others, that unlock inherent value created.PE funds, by
their structure, strategy and objectives, serve as reliable vehicles for
sustained economic development. Their strategic utilisation by economic
managers should spur sturdy development in identified sectors with
results in a number of benchmarks over the long term.A needed government
policyTo maximise the effectiveness of PE investments, a government
policy would be needed that prioritises PE funds as strategic vehicles
in the entrepreneurship drive, targetting the commensurate effects of
job growth, broad economic development and meeting key SDGs. \xa0Such a
policy should identify sectors with strong multiplier effects on the
aforementioned policy objectives, such as Agro-processing,
Infrastructure and Health.Based on such a PE policy, the Government of
Ghana (GOG) shall be expected to lead the charge in addressing some of
the constraints affecting that asset class, take limited partner
position in some PE funds of funds or directly in funds, and in
conjunction with the industry players, actively woo and incentivise
domestic and international investors to commit to the Ghana agenda. It
is worthy of note, that the GOG's most important role in the PE drive
lies in creating a stable and strong economic environment, characterised
by currency stability, low inflation and low yields on fixed income
instruments coupled with more empowering regulations such as enabling
Limited Partnerships in Ghana, which should boost fund domiciliation in
the country.The essence of PE funds in the economic space is well
documented, being favourable on various metrics as signaled by an 83.7
percent jobs growth in PE-backed firms in the U.S, vis-&agrave;-vis a 27
percent jobs growth of non-PE-backed entities, over 1995&ndash;2013.
Sales growth over the same period hit 134 percent in PE-backed entities
versus 31 percent growth in non-PE backed entities over the same period.
International Financial Corporation's (IFC) data for emerging economies
was on a similar up-trend, as its over US$4.0billion emerging market
portfolio grew jobs in excess of 15 percent over 2000-2011.
Additionally, a McKinsey study in India found that direct jobs in
PE-backed entities grew 6 percent faster than those in non-PE-backed
entities. Moreover, revenues and earnings grew faster in PE-backed firms
by 28 percent and 39 percent respectively, relative to non-PE-backed
comparables.Fund raisingGlobally, it is estimated that only 1 percent of
PE fund raising are successful. Indeed, a 2021 AVCA PE industry survey
reported that 67 percent of General Partners viewed fund raising among
the biggest challenges confronting the continent's industry.
Accordingly, it would be beneficial for the GOG, in concert with
industry players, to be pro-active in facilitating fund raising for
funds under the recommended PE&ndash;Entrepreneurship policy. Initial
emphasis should be laid on domestic fund raising, and its success should
steadily attract and boost foreign investors' commitment to Ghana-target
funds.Key prospective investors are:The government: Ghana's government
has, over the years, invested in the Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF),
initially funded with 25 percent earmarked from the erstwhile National
Reconstruction Levy. However, with the abolishment of the levy in 2007,
the fund has been starved of consistent funding from governments.The
fund has, over the years, been reported to have invested a cumulative
US$100million into portfolio companies across various sectors. This is
on a low rung in view of the nation's high unemployment rate and strong
opportunities from vast economic resources. It thereby paints a weak
posturing of successive governments in utilising PE vehicles in the
much-touted entrepreneurship drive.The GOG should heighten its funding
commitment to the VCTF and other fund of funds, whose investment
policies fall in sync with the PE-Entrepreneurship policy drive,
targetting investees in approved sectors, with an expected multiplier
effect on jobs and other broad economic indicators.GOG youth
entrepreneurship & development vehicles:\xa0 It is well noted that a
number of well-intentioned pro-job and development-targetted
interventions have failed to attain the envisaged objectives. This is
attributable to some inherent weaknesses in the instituted vehicles
tasked with executing those programmes, such as the NYEP, NABCO, SADA,
GYEEDA, among others. These like-initiatives, to a high extent, lacked
the institutional experience, skill-set, and independence to attain the
policy objectives. Their horizons have generally not exceeded political
cycles, and their institutional decisions are, to a fault, near-term.It
would be prudent to diversify the asset mix of these entities by
including PE funds in their portfolios since PE fund managers generally
have the institutional experience, skill-set, independence, longevity
and strong drive for capital gain in the investees. By their structure,
PE funds are more suited in aligning the objectives of the GPs, and by
extension, the investors (in this instance, the government's
socio-economic vehicles) with the managers of the portfolio companies.
PEs are more efficient in capital deployment and their rigorous
monitoring differs from the lax oversight that is more prevalent with
government vehicles.Therefore, the government, through their development
vehicles, should target funds with sector focus and policies that fall
in line with theirs. This could be exemplified by the Planting for Foods
and Jobs (PFJ) initiative, channelling part of its investible capital
into a special fund set up and managed by a PE firm toward reaching the
former's objective. The PE fund could thereby raise additional funds
from other investors which identify with PFJs objectives. Another is the
National Youth Employment Program (NYEP) channelling part of its capital
to a fund of funds such as the VCTF, which then takes a limited partner
position in a fund that matches its objectives. Others, such as the one
village one dam initiative, could make capital commitments to PE funds,
set up to invest in and manage entities developing and managing
agriculture infrastructure, such as irrigation dams. In exiting,
acquirors could include municipal assemblies, utilising municipal funds
for such acquisitions toward the economic growth of their
localities.Pension funds: Pension funds, across the globe, based on
their long-term horizons and in pursuit of return-outperformance over
more conservative assets, have over the years been significant investors
in private equity funds.Tier I: Ghana's Tier 1 Pension scheme is managed
by the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) and the
monopoly affords SSNIT a cache of reliable cash flow, with assets in
excess of GH&cent;11billion as at the close of the 2020 FY. Equities
accounted for 50 percent of the aggregate portfolio with unlisted
equities constituting 32.89 percent of the aggregate asset slate, making
it the biggest asset class. It is a strong statement of SSNIT's affinity
for unlisted equities.However, going forward, it would be prudent for
SSNIT to outsource its unlisted equity allocations and management to PE
funds with strong track records. SSNIT's return on investments paled in
comparison to a number of primary metrics, such as yields on GOG
instruments and the inflation rate. Over the 2016&ndash;2020 range,
positive real return was solely attained in the 2017 financial year,
contributed in part by equities, attested by 1.42 percent and -1.82
percent equity returns in 2020 and 2019, respectively. This does not
exactly posit a sterling fund management track record. SSNIT's unlisted
equity management largely appears as a buy and hold model with undefined
horizons and minimal exits over the years. This might be a contributory
factor in the low portfolio returns as there's usually more opportunity
to maximise gains upon exit. It also denotes a passive strategy toward
value creation, vis-&agrave;-vis the more active value creation
undertakings of GPs.Investing in unlisted equities via PE funds would
avail SSNIT of the value creation strategies of the General Partners.
The PEs, in pursuit of capital gains and based on competition would be
more buoyed to attain returns. Additionally, the PEs would, to a greater
extent, be devoid of governmental interference.Private pension schemes:
Ghana's Tier II pension schemes are by the National Pensions Act 766
permitted to invest up to a 5 percent cap of investible funds in PEs.
However, as at the close of the 2020 financial year, alternative assets
accounted for a measly 0.03 percent slice of the GH&cent;22billion
assets. The fund managers have exhibited a deep risk aversion with
government instruments and bank securities accounting for approximately
90 percent of AUM.The long-term horizon of PEs, coupled with their
historically strong performance should steadily boost private pension
fund managers' appetite for that asset class. It was recently reported
that Injaro Investment Advisors (a PE/VC firm) launched a fund with a
number of private pension schemes among the committed investments. This
is a welcome sign and should serve as a prelude to a steady shift to
that asset class by pension fund managers.BanksDevelopment Bank of Ghana
(DBG): Development banks seek to attain specific development objectives
in the economy, utilising medium to long-term funding either directly
into investments or via other financial entities and vehicles. They
generally seek to achieve key SDGs and thereby avail their technical
expertise for their targetted sectors. Consequently, the DBG, with
committed capital, reported to be in excess of US$750million, is well
primed to invest in PE funds under the recommended PE-Entrepreneurship
policy.Universal banks: The universal bank business model and capital
requirements, as stated earlier, are not structured for equity capital
deployment. Nonetheless, they have historically attained attractive
earnings from extending credit in the nation's economy. It would be
prudent for the GOG to endeavour the banks to invest a portion of
earnings into PE funds under the recommended programme. This could be
fitted with tax benefits, with taxes being charged on capital gains from
realising the PE returns at exit. This is a win-win situation, with
expected strong returns for the banks, subsequent credit availability
for the efficient PE-backed firms, favourable effects on the nation's
job numbers, and development metrics. Alternatively, it could be enacted
into an act, akin to the National Reconstruction Levy, where a
percentage of banks' earnings shall be invested into PE funds under the
policy, targetting returns at exit. Indeed, it would be prudent to levy
higher rates on erstwhile development banks such as ADB and NIB, and
commit into sectors that fall in line with their former mandates, such
as Agric-focus funds by the ADB. The GOG could also consider committing
dividends earned from its stake in universal banks into such PE funds.
Their utilisation would be more structured and measured to spur
development vis-&agrave;-vis being paid into the general government
kitty.Value creationThe General Partners' driving force is to maximise
the value of the portfolio company, vis-&agrave;-vis the value at
acquiring a stake. This is achieved from capital gain, based on the
commensurate compensation from the carried interest (the GPs share of
returns over a pre-agreed benchmark/ hurdle rate). Thus, the GPs craft
value creation plans (VCP) prior to gaining a stake, as indeed, a stake
with no viable value creation pathway is hardly worth pursuing.Under the
recommended PE-Entrepreneurship policy, the essence of value creation
plans cannot be overemphasised. It is expected to be crafted and
undertaken not solely in pursuit of capital gains, but additionally to
attain the aforementioned objectives of job growth and economic
development. These value creation strategies should build a number of
regional corporate giants, blazing their trails across the continent
with strong employment capacities and buoying economic development.
These objectives are expected to guide the value creation plans with
notable strategies of financial engineering, operating engineering,
corporate governance, among others.Financial engineeringFinancial
engineering involves quantitative and technical theories in solving
problems via developing financial strategies and products. Value
creation via financial engineering comes in various models. It is quite
commonplace in the developed markets, characterised somewhat by firms in
the more matured to declining phase of their life-cycle. Leverage is
occasionally utilised in acquisitions backed by the target company's
assets and cash flows. Job cuts and sale of non-strategic assets are
sometimes used among a suite of cost cutting strategies to dampen the
cost margins and heighten the bottom lines, with its attendant bolster
of returns and valuations. That approach, is perceived to be more
rewarding for a narrow set of stakeholders &ndash; notably, investors
and fund managers. This model has, to an extent, mired PE funds in
unpopular tags of heartless corporate mercenaries.However, we expect a
more growth-endearing approach under the recommended PE-
Entrepreneurship policy. This is because the African scenario hinges
highly on a strong degree of untapped markets, where capital is mainly
deployed to fuel growth and build market share. The PE firms are
expected to actively and strategically optimise the portfolio companies'
capital structure and implement sturdy risk management strategies.The PE
firm's involvement in the portfolio companies boosts the latter's
corporate image, with probable enhancement of its credit profile. The PE
firms, based on their robust relationship with banks and other debt
providers, shall be able to negotiate and structure more optimal debt
which shall be utilised in value enhancing strategies such as retiring
less favourable debt, among others. Additionally, sturdy risk management
models could be crafted and developed in line with the dynamics of the
investees' industry and company-specific risks. PE firms are useful in
projecting future dynamics, weighing various scenarios and thereby
designing appropriate and far-sighted risk management solutions.
Instruments such as options and forward contracts could be executed for
commodity-based companies, among others. These could offset losses and
protect value created over the fund's horizon.Corporate governanceThe
importance of corporate governance for sustainable value creation cannot
be over-stated. \xa0The nation has a high estimated failure rate of
start-ups and a high informality of resident enterprises. Business
owners generally perceive firms as extensions of themselves, thereby
subject to the same self-interest whims, rather than separate entities
subject to corporate governance principles. Indeed, the 2017-2020
banking and related sector crises brought to the fore poor corporate
governance as practised among the distressed companies. Their symbols
are quite familiar and serve as a strong proxy (or mirror the poor
practices) in the nation's business circles; weak board composition,
conniving board members in the flouting of regulatory and ethical
provisions, conflict of interest issues, among others.A McKinsey survey
across 70 firms on the dynamics between PE boards and management
evidenced the outperformance of the PE investees over publicly listed
companies and also private non-PE funded entities. Stronger corporate
governance practice was noted as a major factor, with the portfolio
companies' governance found to be more engaging and direct.The board is
recognised as the primary agent to ensure adherence to corporate
governance and, as such, the PEs would be expected to constitute boards
of experienced, high integrity professionals with the proven skill-set
to run the investees toward attaining the returns targets while meeting
the developmental and job targets of the PE policy. The strong
supervision of the PEs should, to a high extent, keep the portfolio
firms in strict compliance with corporate governance rules. These
should, overtime, improve risk mitigation and build a more structured
corporate culture, primed for strong value creation and thereby more
sustainable growth.Operational engineeringPE funds typically undertake
operational due diligence prior to acquisition to gain insight into the
existing operational practice and diagnose potential kinks in the
operational loop, of which resultant transformation should improve
efficiency, with attendant effects on earnings, financial position and
returns on investments.It is empirically proven that PE firms that
assign directors and managers with operational background (i.e.
industry-specific experience) tend to outperform quoted peers. PE funds
under the programme will be expected to employ the services of industry
experts with the required skill-set to lead the investees, reduce
operational bottlenecks, enter new markets, improve synergies, and drive
efficiency via speed and quality of delivery while ensuring more
cost-friendly approaches. The PE firm would be expected to bring their
network and contacts to bear on the operations of the investees. This
can be exemplified in the form of using their deeper reach to source
inputs in greater quantum and negotiate lower costs.ExitsExits are the
pathway for investors to realise capital gain. This is well illustrated
by the pun &lsquo;no exit, no gain'. Exit brings to the fore the
valuation tradeoff as the PE funds seek the lowest possible floor
valuation at gaining equity stake and seek maximisation of valuation at
exit to heighten returns for its stakeholders. Exit strategies are
crafted and developed within the larger investment policy of the fund.
Consequently, the exit strategy and possibly the preferred buy-side
parties should be in line with the objectives of the recommended
government PE policy.Exiting the business is not a straight forward
process compared to listed equities on more liquid bourses where stocks
change hands via a few strokes of the trading terminals. This is a low
liquidity asset; consequently, trading involves a deeper deal-making
process, valuations and negotiations.Exiting is noted as quite a
difficult process and even more so on the African continent, with a
relatively weaker mergers & acquisitions culture. Indeed, in the 2021
AVCA survey, 76 percent and 67 percent of LPs & GPs, respectively listed
exit challenges among the biggest slate of problems that PE fund
managers will face over the next 3 years.GPs generally exercise a number
of exit strategies; and though these might be crafted in the limited
partnership, it is nevertheless subject to the state and timing of the
financial market, the economy, industry of operations, capital
requirements, portfolio strategy, pricing constraints, etc.In exiting,
there is an interplay between the PE fund, the buyer and the PE-backed
firm, with a delicate balancing act of their separate objectives. Key
exit strategies expected to be considered under the PE-Entrepreneurship
programme are:Trade or strategic saleThis involves the sale of an equity
stake to a non-financial firm, usually in a similar industry, part of
the industry's value chain (such as a real estate company gaining a
PE-backed cement manufacturing company) or forming/joining a
conglomerate. Unlike a financial sale, the buyer(s) usually seeks
strategic benefits from the acquisition, such as increased market share
(Expected to be more efficient and effective than that envisaged from
organic growth), benefitting from a specialised skill or market niche
expertise of the PE-backed firm, affording diversification and economies
of scale, dampening costs, among others. A trade sale also provides a
viable route for foreign companies to enter Ghana's business space,
purchasing entities which have been strategically grown and are poised
for another phase of growth.Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)This route
floods the dream list of many an entrepreneur. Start a business from
scratch; a strong growth phase and next a high-value listing on a
bourse, huge sums milked as the firm leaps into a unicorn (a US$billion
plus value) and gracing the Forbes list of nothings to greats. The
statistic is quite challenging as it is estimated that there is a remote
0.00006 percent chance of building a billion-dollar company.
Nevertheless, the popularity of IPO exits is that they present the
strongest route to maximising capital gain.The PE firm seeks to realise
gains via Initial Public Offerings on an equity bourse. The remaining
investors which usually include the entrepreneur, benefit from the
upsides in the stock price, with the resultant increase in value and
vice-versa. The more diverse the shareholders, the less threat from
shareholders, such as shareholder activists cast in the Carl Icahn
molds.Nonetheless, the IPO route, mirroring the global picture, is the
least utilised, though not the least favoured. The dynamics toward
successful IPO exits are quite a number, but can be mostly summed up as
potential shareholders' sentiments which are influenced by financials,
product demand, market share, company visibility, among others, as
investors seek to gauge the potential value-upside in the listed
company.In Ghana, a number of factors bedevil the IPO exit path.
Investors' appetite for listing is the most important factor, in sync
with their expectations of returns. The picture on Ghana's bourse has
not exactly been encouraging. Over the past decade, the market
registered bearish outturns in five years and the composite market
returns over the range was estimated at approximately 146 percent,
trailing the GOG 1-year risk-free asset by 55.94 percentage points. This
certainly makes the bourse a difficult &lsquo;poster child' to whip up
investible funds from the public and thereby increase the success of
exits via IPOs.The drive to integrate West Africa's capital markets,
expected to deepen activities on the various markets, has yet to
materialise. The West African Markets Integration Council has been set
up for close to a decade, and after years of long discussions and
note-taking sessions, the plan has steadily gained more weight in ideas
than in practice. The integration of the region's markets would surely
deepen the opportunities for IPO exits, under the recommended
PE-Entrepreneurship programme.In line with the PE programme, more
strategic actions must be spearheaded by the regulators and other
players to increase the strength of the bourse for exits, such as
encouraging market makers to help address the age-old problem of poor
liquidity. Most importantly, the government debt management must be
improved over the long term. This feeds into the high rates of the GOG
risk- free instruments indicated by a 10-year average of 18 percent (GOG
1-Year note). It is a high disincentive for fund managers to take up
higher risks on the bourse.In summary, the gains from elevating PE funds
into the entrepreneurship agenda cannot be over-emphasised. The public
finance is stretched, with a high debt over-hang; 78 percent of GDP
(Mar-2022). Consequently, a PE drive presents a viable pathway to
strategically boost entrepreneurship in key sectors with minimal effects
on the national debt, while targetting strong returns on invested
capital. The expected increase in entrepreneurship, boost in business
value, and employment should steadily reflect in increased tax revenue
for the GOG, strengthening the public finance. Additionally, the touted
rigorous PE monitoring approach, improved corporate governance of
investees and more structured operations should steadily be the new
standard-bearers or benchmark for business practice in the economy, even
among non-PE-backed entities. This should gradually reduce the lax
managerial practice in the nation's business circles. The PE vehicles
can be utilised to broaden businesses across the country and help in
decentralising economic generation across the country. This should
reduce the high urban drift and the security ills from unemployment.\xa0

Tips, trends, tech - entrepreneurship advice from jurors of the
Britannia Marie Gold My Startup competition 2022

In Part II of our coverage of this annual initiative for homepreneurs,
we share jury insights from four entrepreneurship experts. Here are some
key takeaways.

Britannia Marie Gold, the third-largest biscuit brand in India, recently
completed Season III of its annual women entrepreneurship initiative, My
Startup. Ten winners each year were awarded Rs 10 lakh each to kickstart
their business ventures (see our coverage of the earlier 2020 edition
here).

YourStory was part of the external jury for the shortlisted entries,
along with Rashmi Bansal (author of 10 best-selling books on
entrepreneurship, and Visiting Professor at Ashoka University; Sairee
Chahal, Founder of SHEROES and Mahila Money; Renu Shah (Founder of
Shakti - The Empathy Project, an incubation programme for women social
entrepreneurs); and Aakanksha Bhargava (CEO and President of PM
Relocations).

The initiative received 1.3 million entries this year from across the
length and breadth of India. The 10 winners this year are from Odisha,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Bihar. The founders' ages range
from 21 to 46, in sectors such as digital services, farming, skill
development, healthcare, and food (see winners list in Part I of our
coverage here).

Pandemic impact

Though the pandemic seems to be waning in India, its economic impact
still continues to be felt.

"There have been challenges and opportunities both. The traditional
businesses suffered the most, and yet there has been good news for
tech-based enterprises," observes Renu Shah.

"The pandemic has adversely affected sectors like travel and tourism,
but on the other hand, we have seen the maximum number of unicorns
emerging from the pandemic," she adds, citing edtech as an example.
Companies that reinvented their businesses saw growth.

"I feel entrepreneurs are natural fighters who are not just optimistic
but also agile and resilient. Hence, the pandemic gives them an inherent
and underlying opportunity to reinvent and do something," Aakanksha
Bhargava affirms.

"When survival is the main focus to sustain them, entrepreneurs rise to
the occasion," she adds. Disrupted work, lack of financial support, and
limited market access were other challenges, in addition to the anxiety
and fear.

"Necessity is the mother of invention. In the pandemic, many
breadwinners have lost their jobs and therefore women have taken up
entrepreneurship," Rashmi Bansals says. Digital and social media have
also helped startups market themselves and conduct transactions.

"The pandemic was definitely a tipping point for entrepreneurship in
India. Several businesses struggled with zero revenues for a while.
Shifts to remote work, tackling supply chain issues, and taking products
to consumers were core challenges," Sairee Chahal observes.

But the pandemic accelerated the digitalisation of businesses. "Some
verticals like D2C, social commerce, healthtech and finetch, which were
already in the making, really took off, with more and more consumers
shopping online. The pandemic saw the launch of several new businesses
that fulfilled gaps in the market," she adds.

"Our community marketplace SHOPOnSHEROES was a direct response to the
surge of women micro-entrepreneurs as well as women-founded D2C brands
offering quality products," Sairee recalls.

"Mahila Money, our neobank and financial services stack for aspirational
women, was also launched in a post-pandemic world to fulfil their credit
needs. Technology has helped us take businesses to market faster," she
adds.

Trends

Several trends are shaping the fields of business and entrepreneurship,
ranging from technology to policy.

"Tech is going to take the lead in any sector. Edtech, healthtech,
fintech, and tech solutions for the environment and energy will be in
the lead," Renu says, pointing to EVs (electric vehicles) as an example.

In other trends, Rashmi points to the rise of small and home-based
businesses, and more startups employing women. "Startups will be
expected to make a profit, the old-fashioned way," she adds.

"We're seeing widespread digital adoption by startups to improve
productivity, streamline workflows, and make platforms more intuitive,"
Sairee observes. "There will be more focus on women's consumer needs and
aspirations," she adds.

She sees the hybrid work model getting normalised as well. "Companies
will be more open to hiring and working with specialists from different
parts of the globe. Our workplace is in some ways already a global
village," she says.

Aakanksha foresees the wellness sector really picking up ahead. "There
are a lot of things happening in the wellness sector, to boost people to
have a better work-life balance, exercise plan, good diet, and healthy
lifestyle," she says.

Founder tips

The jurors also offer tips for women entrepreneurs, from personal growth
to business connections and tech skills.

"Entrepreneurship is a lonely journey, especially for women. But the
times are changing and now there is support for women striving in this
direction," Renu observes, pointing to the growth in incubators,
accelerators, and government schemes.

"Don't feel helpless, reach out to the ecosystem and I am sure you will
find support. Giving up is not an option for any woman," she affirms.

"Intent is the key to accomplishing anything in life. With the right
intent, one will surely find success. If one is clear of what they are
trying to achieve, then they will surely succeed in difficult and
uncertain times," Aakanksha advises.

"Go deep and keep strengthening your offerings, and have a realistic
understanding of whether your business really has the potential to
scale. If not, you may need to identify a new business model," Sairee
advises.

"These tough times really define the way we work, and the value we
create. They make us creative and resilient. The impact of these
experiences compound over time, and build a foundation for continued
success in better times," she adds.

"Start small, dream big," Rashmi sums up.

Failure and resilience

The jurors also share insights on how to interpret failure, and tips on
how to bounce back and recover.

"Failure is a strong word - I would instead look at it purely as
learnings. If you can learn from every setback and difficulty, and
translate that into action, you improve your chances of success in the
future. You can be wildly successful if you stay the course, and go with
your instincts," Sairee advises.

"Don't take failure personally. An idea can fail - it does not make you
a failure. Take it as a life lesson - get up and start walking again,"
Rashmi urges.

"Entrepreneurial ventures fail most of time, sometimes because the
timing is not right or there might be difficult roadblocks. But if
entrepreneurs do not implement their ideas, they would never know what
works and what doesn't," Aakanksha explains.

"To anticipate possible failures, entrepreneurs must build the energy
back-up to avoid getting exhausted. It is also important to have a
strong support network of family, friends and teams. Being
self-motivated and persevering through the low phase is very important,"
she adds.

"Sometimes, when one is on the entrepreneurial journey, failure is all
it takes to pursue something bigger. Failures, if taken in the right
way, can be the stepping stones to success. Failures are important to
succeed," Aakanksha affirms.

"Resilience is what is needed the most by entrepreneurs to rise from
failures. If we are not resilient then we are not entrepreneurs. We need
to rebuild with the new insights that we gain during failure," Renu
advises.

"Times change, circumstances change and so entrepreneurs should always
be ready to reinvent themselves to remain relevant. Technology can be a
gamechanger, so keeping a close eye on market trends can be helpful,"
she adds.

Government and industry roles

The jurors also have tips and suggestions for the government and the
corporate sector on growing and strengthening the startup ecosystem.

"Make it easier for anyone to start a business. There is still too much
paperwork and compliance," Rashmi suggests.

"While there is a shift in the ecosystem, there is a lot that needs to
be done. The government has taken some commendable steps in this
direction. However, the number of women entrepreneurs is still abysmal,"
Renu laments.

She calls for an increase in VC and CSR spends for women entrepreneurs,
and more education, research, data and reports focused on their issues.
"I would also like to see women and other leaders dedicate a few hours a
month to mentor upcoming entrepreneurs," she adds.

In addition to content availability and support from government and
corporates, Aakanksha points to the increasing number of people who are
available to give talks on leadership, growth, and team nurturing.

"I've always said that entrepreneurship is the engine that will drive
jobs and opportunity in the 21st century, especially in a country like
India. Let's nurture the entrepreneurial mindset early on in schools and
colleges," Sairee urges.

She calls for more opportunities for MSMEs (micro, small and medium
enterprises) to launch and thrive. "Make it easy to seek permissions and
licenses, and reduce red tape. Let's build more accelerators that can be
accessed in small towns and remote locations, where people seek
opportunities," she adds.

"Make the entrepreneurship landscape inclusive for women, and
marginalised communities," Sairee advises.

Startup activities

Many jurors themselves are actively involved in the startup ecosystem,
and share some of their insights on the emerging opportunities.

Rashmi is teaching a course called 'The Road Less Travelled' to students
of Ashoka University. "Last summer, I also ran a programme called 'My
First Startup' for students of Class IX-XII. I firmly believe the
earlier you get exposed to entrepreneurship, the better career choices
you will make," she says.

"I engage with startups daily through my incubation programme. STEP
(Shakti - The Empathy Project) is a programme for women-led early-stage
social- enterprises," Renu explains.

"This year is exciting for us, we are moving to two cohorts a year. One
of them is in Hindi, and have also launched a new program called WINGS
Challenge in which we encourage women to submit their business ideas,"
she adds.

Aakanksha has been an angel investor in a number of startups a swell,
and mentored them. "I am a speaker with 'The Outstanding Speakers
Bureau' and mentor with NITI Ayog," she says.

She has been a guest lecturer with Indian Business School at Hyderabad,
Division of MHROD at Delhi School of Economics, RLA College South
Campus - Delhi, IILM University Gurugram, and PSG College of Technology.

She also aims to leverage social media to create content around
entrepreneurship, mentoring, leadership, marketing, branding, and PR.

Sairee has mentored many women founders over the years. She was also
part of the Delhi government's initiative to nurture the
entrepreneurship mindset in schools.

"Interventions at such a young age can be transformative," Sairee signs
off.

NEW DELHI, MAR 03, 2021: STARTUPS need to be encouraged to experiment
and their innovations should be affordable, accessible and have an
impact on society, said Commerce and Industry Minister Mr Piyush Goyal
on Tuesday.

"Innovation has to be affordable for the people, accessible to the
masses, and should have an impact on society," said the minister as he
addressed the Global Bio-India Startup Conclave 2021, organized by the
Department of Biotechnology (DBT). During the event, the Project
Development cell of DBT and five new technologies were launched.

He said that our startups, young professionals, innovators, thinkers and
scientists will be at the cutting edge of technology worldwide, and at
the forefront of India's development. The minister expressed the hope to
see more growth and progress, and newer technologies which will serve
India and ensure "we convert future challenges into opportunities."

Mr Goyal also said that while startups should be praised for their
forward-thinking and innovations, they should not be afraid of failure.

"Our startups need to be encouraged to experiment, to go beyond the run
of the mill thinking. We need to ensure that they are not afraid of
failure. It is only when somebody fails, he knows how not to do
something, and the learning helps in the future," he said.

The minister added that the need of the hour is to engage more with
rural India where there is untapped potential and talent. Calling for
more private sector participation, he said the government's role is to
be an "enabler, a service provider."

"You cannot have great innovation and invention coming up through just
government initiative, and we need to have all sections of business
involved. The synergy between the government and the private sector is
essential," he said.

Mr Goyal assured complete support from the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry to the startups, including support to get access to the funds,
opportunities and exposure to the world.

The startup market is taking on more and more risk

December 03 -- Hello from the blisteringly cold East Coast of the United
States, where I am eating doughnuts to ward off the effects of my
COVID-19 vaccine booster shot. Thus far the third dose of Moderna is not
as bad as the second, but who knows what is coming. So we'll stay brief
today in case I fall out of my desk chair and straight into a nap
midkeystroke.

To start, thank you. This little weekend newsletter now has comfortably
over 30,000 subscribers, and an open rate that sits in the mid- to
high-40s each week. It's part of a larger project I kicked off at
TechCrunch when I came back but was far from a settled question when we
added the newsletter to the regular Exchange columns.

 

Frankly, I figured it was a coin flip if it would get an audience. The
bet wound up paying out, and because of you, The Exchange now publishes
six times weekly. That's just good fun. Thank you.

Now, risk!

A little while back we chatted through the point that risks from the
startup market are slipping more frequently into the public markets.
This meant that the regular investor can now get their hands on more
nascent, higher-priced startup equity than before thanks to SPACs and
some, well, interesting public offerings.

But inside that point was the implicit argument that startup risk is
also rising for its private market backers. Let's talk about what is
going on:

-   Startup valuations are rising thanks to ample capital availability,
    limited investments with strong yield and related issues. You've
    heard this bit before.

1.  Startup valuations are also rising thanks to more investors going
    earlier in the investing process. Again, you've heard this before.
    But you may not be aware of how it's a self-reinforcing issue. Large
    funds can invest a stage "earlier" than they might given the size of
    their funds, essentially taking out an option contract on a larger
    purchase of shares in the startup in question without risking their
    overall returns profile. This pushes later-stage money, generally,
    earlier. And valuations rise as later-stage investors are less
    price-sensitive to early-stage valuations thanks to a dollar
    differential. More simply, if you have $1 billion to invest and you
    put $5 million into a Series A, you don't care that much if it's at
    a $65 million pre-money valuation or a $75 million pre-money
    valuation. What you do care about is putting $50 million more into
    winners when they raise their next round.

1.  But there's more: Venture investors report to The Exchange that
    startup valuations are rising in part thanks to growth rates not
    only proving stronger than anticipated at tech companies, but also
    that growth rates are proving to be more durable than expected.
    That's to say that former startups are going public with faster
    growth than many expected, and they are holding onto that pace of
    expansion longer. The impact of that is that tech companies may be
    worth more in the future than anticipated, so investors can pay more
    now and not worry as much incrementally as you'd expect.

1.  Another factor to consider regarding rising prices that Menlo
    investor Matt Murphy explained to me recently is that the old
    venture expectations of startup failure rates are now incorrect. The
    failure rate is lower than it was, and the all-important hit rate is
    higher, he said.

You might look at the above as a whole, and think well, maybe all those
insta-unicorns and six-figure rounds make sense? It's a somewhat
comforting perspective to take. After all, the putatively smart money is
taking the wager that faster, more durable growth and fewer failures -
essentially that SaaS is hard to kill - will balance out higher costs to
generate the sort of returns required to make venture math square up.

But, butttttttttt, there's more and more risk being taken on because the
fundamentals of the startup market have not improved much since the
COVID-induced boom in software buying took off after the initial shocks
of the pandemic wore off. That's to say: The startups that venture
investors are backing this year haven't really seen their macro fortunes
improve since mid-2020, but they are busy raising lots more money, lots
faster. That generates increased investment risk.

There are more than 900 unicorns in the market today, all of which will
need IPOs to generate the sort of return that their backers expect. If
the market does finally correct a bit, just to get a little more
historically aligned, quite a number of high-priced private companies
could find themselves stuck in limbo between their private-market
valuation and what the public markets might pay. It could get sticky.
People are just betting that it doesn't.

All this is to say that despite there being some reasonable reasons for
why startup prices are going up as they also raise more capital, earlier
and faster, it is hardly a zero-marginal-risk wager.

Now, go eat some leftovers and get the fuck offline.

-Alex

Nigeria launches $672 million tech fund for young investors

March 15 -- Nigeria, the largest economy in Africa, has launched a $672
million fund to support tech and creative sectors for young investors
who struggle to raise capital. 

 

The fund - targeting 15 to 35-year-olds - comes at a time when there are
concerns locally about the failure of U.S. startup-focused lender SVB
Financial Group, which has supported startups in Nigeria.

Chipper Cash, a cross border payments startup, has said it had $1
million in SVB. Some of the biggest startups, including e-commerce firm
Jumia and Africa-focused fintech firm Flutterwave, told Reuters they had
no exposure to the bank.

 

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo launched the $672 million fund under the
Digital and Creative Enterprises Programme (DCEP) in the federal capital
Abuja, the presidency said in a statement.

African Development Bank will put in $170 million, $116 million will
come from Agence Francaise de Developpement and another $70 million from
Islamic Development Bank, the presidency said.

The government through Bank of Industry Nigeria will release $45 million
while the private sector pledged $271 million.

"DCEP is a government initiative to promote innovation and
entrepreneurship in the digital tech and creative industries and
especially targeted at job creation," Osinbajo was quoted as saying at
the launch of the fund.

Nigeria has the largest number of startups in Africa - mostly in tech
and fintech - which have pulled funding from overseas banks and venture
capital firms.

But most startups still struggle to attract funding because banks demand
that they provide collateral, which they do not have.

Five common cognitive biases every entrepreneur must get over with

From overconfidence, fundamental attribution error, and confirmation
bias, to sunk-cost fallacy and bandwagon effect - these five biases
typically cripple the founders and early employees of enterprises, and
also derail the organisational progress.

Humans are not as wise as the word 'sapiens' suggests. We commit
mistakes, and alas, in a very predictable manner. The study of
systematic biases and errors that creep into everyday human behaviour
has helped scores of economists and psychologists bag Nobel Prizes, and
author several best-sellers for the popular audience.

The very domain of behavioural economics and the sub-fields of
behavioural finance, behavioural marketing et al., have become mainstay
disciplines in B-Schools and corporates alike. That's how much our
understanding of ourselves has moved from the days of Adam Smith and the
invisible hand. The entrepreneur is no immune to such biases. If
anything, such beings are far more susceptible to fall for such biases
owing to the very pursuit of success against all odds.

This piece is aimed at calling out five of the most destructive of the
biases that typically cripple the founders and early employees of
enterprises and derail the organisational progress. As a bonus, a set of
approaches are offered on how to overcome such cognitive errors before
they entirely disable your pursuit.

The field of behavioural psychology, and the study of how humans commit
systematic errors and biases, mostly unknown of the fallouts, has
produced stalwarts like Herbert Simon, Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky,
Nicholas Nassim Taleb, Dan Arely, Malcolm Gladwell, and Richard Thaler,
amongst others. Their research and writing, including those in popular
press, had often fallen to the deaf ears of aspiring entrepreneurs as if
they are cut-out from a different cloth (which is only sometimes true).

Five of the most common cognitive biases that impact an entrepreneurial
trajectory are as follows: overconfidence bias, fundamental attribution
error, confirmation bias, sunk-cost fallacy, and bandwagon effect. Let's
discuss each with an example in the context of starting and scaling a
business.

Overconfidence bias

Called by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman as the mother of all the
biases, this should be our starting point. In fact, one of the most ill
placed advices to be lend to any budding entrepreneur is to 'just do
it', and yet it remains as the sine qua non of misplaced motivations.
There are far greater number of entrepreneurs who have perished to
obscurity than those whom we know of by just doing it! Let's face it.

The very fact that someone is taking a chance of starting up indicates
that she isn't short of confidence, to an extent that she is almost
bordering overconfidence, and then the jingoism of just doing it serves
no good. She would gloss over the hygiene checks, would place far more
unnecessary bets, and make callous calls, all owing to the
overconfidence bias.

The current debacle of the WeWork IPO comes to mind here, where the
co-founder Adam Neumann paid no attention to the naysayers before he had
to cut a sorry face. So, keep your confidence in check, at all times.

Fundamental attribution error

A close second on the fatality of all the cognitive biases would be the
fundamental attribution error, where a person tends to over-emphasise
personality-based explanations and discounts situational explanations
for one's behaviour. In simpler terms, you attribute success to your
talent or your disposition in life while failure to the situation or
other external factors. And we all are guilty of this passing-the-buck
phenomenon.

But when you are responsible for the fate of investors, customers,
employees, and several others who have pinned their hopes on you, you
can't conveniently externalise the problem, but you have to own it up.

Take for instance what now ousted founder of Uber, Travis Kalanick,
infamously quipped - "we're in a political campaign, and the candidate
is Uber and the opponent is an asshole named Taxi". That's failure
written all over the statement and the person involved. However, many
such insights spring up only at the hindsight; and that's where you must
surround yourself with people who can think otherwise (more on this
later). So, own it up at all times, for the stakes are really high once
you start.

Confirmation bias

A close nail in the coffin is the confirmation bias that leads one to
seek, receive, filter, interpret, and adjudge incoming information which
suits one's pre-conceived notions or hypothesis. The confirmation error
doesn't allow one to check the blind spots at all till they become
severe.

The conferences you attend, the people you meet, and the material you
read allows you to keep your own assumptions pious and tranquil till the
time a Black Swan event jolts you out of your bearings.

You become systematically blinded to certain aspects of the nature, such
as competitors, substitutes, or disruptors. In today's world which is
replete with information and soundbites, the confirmation bias has
reached its peak, and one has to be really nudged hard to break away
from the comfort zone. It's the same confirmation bias that led Steve
Ballmer, Microsoft's former CEO, to say - "there's no chance that the
iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance."

It's because Ballmer's world view was narrowed down by the very success
of Microsoft and a moderate one of Apple in computers. He just extended
the fates logically to an entirely new arena, mobile phones. Remember,
the absence of proof is not a proof of absence.

Sunk-cost fallacy

The sunk-cost fallacy kicks in when it comes to investment. It's about
throwing good money behind bad money and not able to discern when to
call it off, leading to an escalation of commitment. It happens when
your spouse acknowledges in the middle of a movie that it's intolerable,
and still you hang around till the very finish since you have paid for
the movie. Remember, whether you endure the movie or walk out right
away, the money isn't coming back, but you can save yourself from some
extra trouble and wasted time.

In a startup context, just because you had spent on a product dearly and
it's not going anywhere, you need to learn to pull the plug, and any
future decision shouldn't be influenced by how much has been sunk
already.

It's easier said than done, and that's why business is replete with
failures from enterprises and startups alike. The failure of Nokia to
move beyond Symbian, or of that of Microsoft to adopt Android or the
Open Source are just a few cases of sunk-cost fallacy.

Bandwagon effect

Thanks to the very media where you are consuming this piece, there's
enough hype created at next to nothing cost and there's no abating the
trend. The startup world is driven by more fads than the enterprise
world, since the former has very few stakes in the ground and little
commitments to talk about.

The very lack of inertia would mean that entrepreneurs get carried away
swiftly by what's the talk of the town, and that's only acerbated by the
investor's community and the media. It's the season of apps as I am
writing this piece, and no sooner, we would have startups offering tools
of general-purpose AI and the ilk.

The more of the same leads to diminishing entry barriers and deferred
returns for the investors. It's difficult to tide over the noise and
have some independence of thinking.

That's what the famous George S Patton noted, "if everyone is thinking
alike, then somebody isn't thinking." It's imperative that you take the
high road, especially when starting off.

So, we have these five (and certainly more) cognitive biases, namely
overconfidence bias, fundamental attribution error, confirmation bias,
sunk-cost fallacy, and bandwagon effect; and many of these are difficult
to appreciate in the real time. The real question, however, is - how to
overcome these systematic biases systematically? The difficult answer
is - learn to think slow and deliberate, or as Daniel Kahneman would say
"adopt System-2 thinking more often".

Surround yourself with critiques and those who aren't thinking like you.
Finally, go truly beyond your domain and reach out to a diverse context
through your readings, meetings, and wanderings. It's only apt to
conclude this piece with a statement by one of the most daring
entrepreneurs of the present times - Elon Musk - who says, "really pay
attention to negative feedback and solicit it, particularly from
friends." Hope you have more friends who are different than you.

Jorge Zuiga Blanco explains how to develop a winning sales strategy for
any business

Web newswire

India, April 25 -- Entrepreneur and business expert Jorge Zuiga Blanco
provides expert insight into how businesses on any level can attract
more customers and increase sales.

San Jos, Costa Rica " WEBWIRE " Friday, April 22, 2022

Do your best in advance to understand their needs and start your
discussion by explaining how this may benefit your prospect.

The difference between a successful and a failure startup is how well
you define your sales strategy. Understanding how to follow up in the
right way can make a difference in long-term revenue. This includes
everything from increasing your email outreach to finding niche
marketing. Jorge Zuiga Blanco, a successful entrepreneur and businessman
from Costa Rica, shares his top-rated strategies for engaging and
maintaining clients.

Many salespeople and entrepreneurs implement a sales strategy without
understanding the key ingredient. This is what causes customers to turn
away. You lose the connection you have with your client if you just
focus on the benefits and prices of the product or service. It is
impossible to solve their problem if you don't try to understand them.

Your business system must be clear about the problem you can solve.
Blanco says, "Do your best in advance to understand their needs and
start your discussion by explaining how this may benefit your prospect."

People buy results and not just goods and services. Once you have
captured your prospect's interest with your solution, now it is time to
explain clearly how and what they will receive. Value is the end result.

Your outreach can be significantly enhanced by focusing on specific
niche markets that have a problem with the issues you are able to
address. Instead of reaching out to every organization, focus on a small
group of customers.

You will encounter new problems and unique requests from prospects
during your business conversations. This is a good thing, as each
organization you work for has a clear structure of goals and inward
processes. Adds Blanco, "You must be flexible. You have to be positive
and not assume that you can solve their particular problems." Sales
strategies must be adaptable enough to change as needed.

If you manage a large number of leads, it is a good idea to incorporate
lead scoring - a system that ranks prospects - into your business
process. Lead scoring allows you to quickly organize prospects based on
the best chance of closing the deal.

Don't lose heart if you feel there is some confusion or uncertainty in a
presentation or demonstration. Find out the issue and address it. Asking
directly if there are any uncertainties can backfire - your audience
might not respond because they fear being incompetent. Ask for
clarification, offer to clarify the information or give examples to ease
their mind. The goal is to get the customer to buy.

Once you are certain you have the right contact person, it is time to
make a sale. One that captures the attention of your prospect and keeps
them interested in the solution. You risk losing the prospect and your
sale if you spend too much energy or time discussing your company, the
benefits of your solution, customers you've worked for, or why they
should join you today.

Do not give a pitch or a speech. Tell a story. This will attract the
decision-maker or audience and provide an example of your product or
service's real-world value. Storytelling is a great sales strategy.
Because stories keep us interested, we have a higher ability to absorb
information. These strategies can be used to help your business succeed,
whether you are starting a startup or looking to improve the efficiency
of an existing one.

Why failures are intrinsic to my success story

Newstex Blogs

Dec 09, 2021( e27: https://e27.co Delivered by Newstex)

It's natural to feel like a King when you're fresh out of grad school,
especially when you've graduated from one of the best in the world-
Columbia University. Bursting with ideas and big dreams after working in
the US for a couple of years, I was hungry and ambitious about what I
could create.

I returned to India in May 1992 and leapt straight into my first
venture, a multimedia database. It did not work out. I then changed my
direction and attempted something different, reselling American
companies' software products.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, that resulted in nothing too impressive, so I
then dipped my toes into setting up Image Workbench, an image processing
solution, only to face yet another failure.

No failures feel good, but this succession of failures taught me my
first most important lesson: if you want to achieve something big, you
must first put aside your ego before you can become even more courageous
in your pursuits.

IndiaWorld: My first big success

All feelings at the top of my game were crushed with each failure and
unsuccessful business attempt. It was not easy, but I forced myself to
take a step back and re-examine the market, my team, and what I could
offer to make a difference.

From my time outside of India and the development of the internet, I
found an opportunity to bridge the growing information gap between
Indians and NRIs (Non-Resident Indians).

Also Read:15 strategies for a successful acquisition[1]

I recalibrated my team, retaining the best talents and enlisting the
help of my wife, Bhavana, to start India's first internet portal-
IndiaWorld. This portal connected Indians worldwide to their home
country, providing information on cricket, food, and even personal
finance.

It grew to be the most prominent Indian internet platform with Samachar,
Khoj, Khel and Bawarchi. Today, when I mention IndiaWorld, many recall
how it was one of Asia's largest internet deals when Satyam Infoway
acquired it for US$115 million.

Yet, behind this success, defined by big numbers and impressive figures,
was yet another slew of failures, both big and small. People often
forget how long it took to get to the stage of the deal.

The acquisition took place in 1999, and IndiaWorld was a venture started
in 1995. Over these few years, there were numerous failures, including
the shortcomings of eight different portals on the platform. Of course,
there were also some big wins, like the success of four outlets, which
thankfully more than made up for the multiple failures of the others.

From when I set my heart to experiment with this portal until the
ground-breaking deal in 1999, these failures became helpful stepping
stones. I just had to keep going, and I knew the setbacks would
eventually lead my team and me to the place we had to be at.

I had to go to work every day as usual, not because I wanted to increase
the chances of success (it does not necessarily work this way), but more
importantly, reduce the odds of failure. This crucial step, though
simple, is something that I still firmly believe in and has proven to be
true in my journey thus far.

Pivoting into chapter two: Netcore Cloud

The truth is, as an aspiring entrepreneur with your venture and
ambitions, it is easy to imagine that the chances of your success will
be 70 per cent. Yet, one cannot be more wrong. After so many years, the
hard reality is that 99.99 per cent of ventures fail, and one must be
prepared to accept this fact.

Today, many would perhaps associate me with Netcore Cloud, a rebranded
Netcore Solutions I had started working on IndiaWorld back in 1997.

Also Read:Building blocks of success: How I build GudangAda to become
one of Indonesia's most promising startups[2]

Currently, it is a global martech leader in the technology and SaaS
industries, serving over 5000 clients spread across 18 countries,
including India, the USA, Germany, Nigeria, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and UAE. It delivers 15+ billion emails
and tracks 100+ billion marketing events every month for the world's top
marketers.

However, as the change of name and rebranding of the company suggests,
Netcore Cloud had to go through numerous changes and failures to get to
where it is today. In just two decades or so, the Internet has shifted
rapidly at an unprecedented speed.

Expectations evolve, and consumers have constantly changing needs and
wants. Many increasingly want an omnichannel personalised experience
with greater engagement with businesses. On the other hand, companies
require this to retain their loyal supporters and grow their customer
base.

With Netcore Cloud, it was a continuous process of searching and
experimenting with solutions that filled the market gaps, which were
dynamic and ever-changing.

Netcore Cloud started as a Linux-based mail server provider for
enterprises and remained the same for its first decade. Eventually, with
the growth of SMS and email, we realised that changes and pivots had to
be made to offer different services.

These shifts into a marketing automation platform for Netcore Cloud
ensured we stayed relevant. While making these shifts, of course, we
experienced failures- ideas for visual dashboards shattered, mobile
portals did not work out, and even the experiment to create one of the
world's first blog search engines went down the drain.

Yet, all these incidents of failures through which we learnt what and
where we could change and adapt, bringing with us lessons learnt for our
future experiments (and successes).

After all this time, I now know that the entire journey of ups and downs
is the real reward and not just the final product or the destination
(exit). We are unafraid of exploring something new or different with my
talented team, even if it fails.

Also Read: These 9 famous startup failures have a lesson for you[3]

What is more important is to observe when things are not working out and
make the crucial decision to either try the same ideas again with a
different approach or shift into a fresh slate to try again. Pivoting is
thus an essential strategy for every business.

Growing as a leader

It is not merely essential to grow your dreams and ideas with a team as
an entrepreneur. Perhaps more importantly, one must also grow as a
person.

I make it a point to read and reflect often and write my thoughts every
day in a blog to help me consolidate all my ideas. Doing so gives me
space for further contemplation, and in the long run, it has helped me
become a better leader.

Constant reflection was the main reason why Netcore could grow so far,
as it was through examining myself that I considered the possibility of
switching the leadership in the company. I'm a curious experimenter at
heart, always bursting with new ideas that I want to work on, but
selling has not exactly been my forte.

This caused a risk in Netcore Cloud's then business strategy since I
inadvertently created mismatched products for the market and our
customers. Just because I could lead IndiaWorld to success did not mean
I could replicate the same level of success with Netcore Cloud. The
context was different, and change was desperately needed.

This was when I had to remind myself of my very first lesson since the
start of my entrepreneur journey. I had to set aside my ego to make the
best decision for the company. After consulting my friend Rajjat, I made
the difficult but necessary choice to step down from the leadership role
and brought in external but very talented and experienced leaders to
drive the business forward.

We welcomed our first external CEO, Abhijit, which worked out very well.
Even today, Netcore Cloud is still led by competent leaders. This switch
in leadership has led to a strong foundation for the business structure
and is leading the company to become India's first B2B SaaS IPO by 2022.

After all these years, my success thus far can be traced back to all the
failures and obstacles I have had to face, whether they were external or
internal. The crushing defeats with consistent losses taught me to keep
trying and reevaluate various business strategies in a volatile and
changing environment.

Also Read:How to successfully build and run a business with minimum
capital[4]

Failing is an incredibly humbling experience. When things are going
downhill, it becomes imperative to set aside your ego to achieve the
best for your ideas and business and the people you serve, both
employees and customers.

I believe no entrepreneur sets out to fail, just as I was at the start
of my entrepreneurial journey, but accepting and learning from failure
is the key to paving your path to eventual success.

According to an IBM and Oxford study, 90 per cent of Indian startups
fail and shut down in the first five years. India is the home of several
successful startups like Flipkart, Zomato, Oyo, Ola Cabs, and Nykaa.
These startups have not only contributed to the Indian economy but have
also generated thousands of jobs. However, startups like PepperTap,
TinyOwl, Local Banya, Taskbob, Stayzilla, Shopo, BabyBerry, and many
more failed to impress the consumers.

India is a developing country, and it needs more successful startups to
support its economy. A vast number of Venture Capitalists in India wish
to invest in startups, but most entrepreneurs fail to secure funding due
to a lack of guidance and exposure. The Indian government offers
numerous benefits to startups like an easy process, application to
tenders, access to funds, R&D facilities, tax execution for a long term,
and easy exit. India needs more entrepreneurs to increase the number of
new booming businesses. Nexford University, a next-generation online
university based in Washington DC, will be hosting a webinar on April 8
with Tom Eisenmann to build future entrepreneurs. The free webinar will
give entrepreneurs a chance to ask questions and gain valuable insights.

In October 2020, Nexford University hosted a webinar focused on bringing
together entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs from across the world.
Over a thousand attendees gained actionable insights from Pierre Fauvet,
Director at Creadev, and Caitlin Fiordirosa, Partner at Drive Capital.
Pierre and Caitlin are among the world's most experienced investors, and
they answered questions like what are the hottest sectors VCs are
looking at and what a VC is really looking for when investing. They also
discussed the mistakes founders make when pitching and understanding how
VCs work. This year, Nexford University brings Tom Eisenmann to guide
aspiring entrepreneurs.

Tom Eisenmann is the Howard H. Stevenson Professor of Business
Administration at the Howard Business School and author of the new book
'Why Startups Fail.' Tom Eisenmann has worked on a multi-year research
project on startup failures. He has interviewed the founders of 470
startups. His research revealed six distinguished patterns that explain
the vast majority of startup failures. Tom Eisenmann is the winner of
the 2015 Case Centre Award in the Entrepreneurship category for Dropbox:
It Just Works.

Aspiring entrepreneurs can learn about the recurring patterns that can
be anticipated and avoided. They can learn to keep their reputations,
relationships, and integrity intact if they fail. Young entrepreneurs
will get the guidance to learn from the failure, heal, and decide
whether to pursue another startup. Most importantly, aspiring
entrepreneurs will learn how to pull the plug and avoid failure. The
attendees will get a few chapters of the book 'Why Startups Fail' for
free. Nexford University strives to provide entrepreneurs with the
skills they need to move forward in life. It focuses on equipping the
founders with the practical skills to build a business plan, launch a
venture, and grow a team. In 2019, Nexford launched the Entrepreneurship
Scholarship and Rs 1.4 Crore funding opportunity for its graduates.

Entrepreneurs are a valuable asset to any country, and entrepreneurship
should be cultivated and nurtured. A college degree is not mandatory for
entrepreneurship, but it can be constructive, as it teaches you
essential skills. Some aspiring entrepreneurs might think that most
famous founders like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Steve Jobs are
college dropouts, but they managed to thrive with a brilliant idea.
However, people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are exceptions.
Every career path requires proper training, and graduating from a
strategically designed school will equip you with finance & accounting,
business law, HR management, and many more skills.

Most universities don't offer programs that equip students with the kind
of skills they need. Nexford University surveyed Fortune 500 CEOs and
studied successful startup founders to develop specialized programs. It
offers Building a Tech Startup program that teaches to apply
entrepreneurial tools and approaches to create a business plan for a new
venture. The dynamic tech world is proliferating, and such programs are
the need of the hour. Nexford University is among the very few
universities in the world that offer a specialization program like
Building a Tech Startup.

'India To Have 150 Odd Unicorns By 2025' Says Yagnesh Sanghrajka, CFO,

Indian startups have been proving their worth over the days, and the
market is bullish it seems. What do investment firms like 100X.VC think
about the same?

In an elaborate tete-a-tete with Express Computer's Gairika Mitra, CFO,
100X.VC gets candid about the way forward for Indian startups.

Edited excerpts:

What role does technology play in emancipating the startup ecosystem?
Could you lay some emphasis on food tech, health tech, and consumer
tech?

I think everywhere, there is an infusion of technology, almost in all
sectors, not just what you named. There are other domains too, like
consumer tech. Food tech is a small space within consumer tech. We can
treat consumer tech as one particular vertical, wherein you can touch
the consumer in any particular manner. So, even a ride-hailing industry
could be considered as consumer tech.

There is F&B segment, health, and wellness. These are all part of
consumer tech, so it's a very broad game. We are seeing technology in
almost every sector. Agritech has also been booming quite a lot. A lot
of agritech startups are looking forward to optimise the food supply
chain, right from the farmer to the distributors, through the trader,
and back to the consumer. In India, industries have grown quite
sporadically. There was no single-handed technology, either introduced
by the Govt., to streamline these industries. As a result, lot of
disorganised growth has taken place, even in healthcare. However, now
with the advent of technology, in each sectors. It's hard to handpick
any sector, that's not touched by technology. That's a very wide term,
so one could keep diving down on that.

What role do you see IT vendors like that of Microsoft, AWS and Amazon
playing in boosting the Indian startup space?

It's happening already. Companies like Microsoft, AWS and Amazon are
very strong players in terms of the Cloud space, and the way they are
promoting startups are basically through their own platforms, by giving
a lot of credits to startups. This is quite meaningful and valuable, as
startup founders struggle to grow their product and platform, in order
to make it a scalable one. These companies are playing a substantial
role in boosting startups right from the initial phase, till the time
the startup starts generating revenues. Thus, there is a meaningful
contribution from these players. They have taken a lead in that, a lot
of startups have benefitted from the same.

A lot of retired IT professionals, and even those serving under their
professional capacity, have been venturing out to start their own
startups. Any particular advice to them?

In my professional space, I have seen a lot of technocrats who have been
consistent in identifying existing problems, and have been viable in
arriving at impeccable solutions. This is the reason, most of these
companies branch out, in order to start their own startup.

In these cases, a major shift in the journey that happens is, having
worked in a corporate space, to their own venture, is a mindshift, from
income to wealth. Typically, when a person works for an organisation,
one is caught up into the daily hurdles of generating salary and earning
revenues for the country. However, when one starts up, they start from
the grass root level. The way of making wealth, is to make the product
more and more scalable, and revenues come after a while. IT
professionals should try to make it relevant to the customers, and not
just their thought process. It's a long and lonely journey.

What kind of tech startups is 100X.VC catering to at present?

We have a good mix of tech startups. There is a mix of consumer tech, HR
tech and conversational AI. These days conversational AI is doing a
commendable job, by getting blue collar workers, to create a resume
through voice. That's a breakthrough technology.

Apart from this, we have agritech and retail tech that has been doing
fairly well. Most of these founders are coming up with great ideas. We
have one company, that assesses road conditions, giving live updates,
just like Google Maps. They specialise in giving live updates from road
conditions, and how can they be improved. Apart from this, we have
fintech companies, both on the lending and investing side.

How many startups does 100X.VC have currently onboard? What are their
verticals like?

Currently 100X.VC has around 20. We launched in July 2019, so we have
been quite lucky in that regard. The batch of 20, is equally distributed
between B2B and B2C. As mentioned before, there is a good mix of
fintech, agritech, HR tech, propriety tech and consumer tech. These are
clubbed and equipped with the latest forms of technology like Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning.

Do you deal with startups that are in varying stages? Like from a
typical early stage to a Series D?

We call ourselves a discovery platform, because typically a funding
round takes time, from an external person, like a serial investor. We
saw this pain point and set up a VC fund, a seed staged fund to help out
bootstrapped founders mostly, or maybe by incubators.

We strive to fund them with small cheques of INR 25-50 lakhs, however,
we work closely with them, to make them investor ready. Another
interesting initiative of ours is 'iSAFE, that stands for India Simple
Agreement for future equity. An iSAFE is a founder-friendly convertible
security note, that's beneficial for both startups and investors. iSAFE
note takes the legal form of compulsorily convertible preference shares
(CCPS), that is convertible on the occurrence of specified events.

Lastly, what are the odd chances of India becoming the largest startup
ecosystem in the world?

Tough to say that, as India is a little behind the developed countries
like the US. In order to become the largest ecosystem, we need to give
it more time. This is primarily because the failure rate of Indian
startups is quite high. The idea is not to have many startups failing.
We want to have more and more successful startups. That's where the
whole differentiation lies.

However, 2018 and 2019 went well for us, where we had around 17 unicorns
in two years, as compared to 4 and 5, compared to the last six and seven
years. This indicates that the pace of creating unicorns is increasing,
and we feel at least by 2025, when India probably reaches its 4.5-5
trillion GDP mark, we would have more than 150 odd unicorns in the
country.

Within my failed startup portfolios, if a founder comes up with a new
idea, I would back them again, says investor Alok Mittal

Body

An engineer by profession, Alok Mittal has always enjoyed solving
problems. Before starting up his entrepreneurial journey, he worked in
the satellite communication field during the early days of his career.

Later, he quit his profession and started JobsAhead, a job listing
platform that connects employers with job seekers in India and abroad,
in 1999. Six years later, the startup was sold to Monster.com, which was
expanding in the Indian market at that time.

After selling his first startup, he took a short break from
entrepreneurship during which he founded the Indian Angel Network along
with his friends.

"While I was looking to set up my next business venture, Canaan Partners
was looking to set up their India presence. So, it was an exciting time
to join venture fund business, so I joined them to set up their India
business," says Alok. He ran the India business for nine years, and in
2015, he exited from Canaan to set up his next venture, Indifi, a B2B
fintech startup.

Siddhartha Ahluwalia, Founder of 100x Entrepreneur Podcast and
Co-founder of SHEROES, caught up with Alok Mittal in this episode of the
podcast, a series that features venture capitalists and angel investors.

The 100x Entrepreneur Podcast is an endeavour to know their habits,
mindsets, and viewpoints that can help entrepreneurs scale 100x.

Work-life balance

Speaking about his daily routine, Alok says: "I wake up at 6 am, go for
a run, and hit my desk at 8-8:15 in the morning - that's a couple of
hours before the crowd starts to come in. I wind up by 7-7:30 pm. I am
an early sleeper and early riser. On Sundays, I like to teach kids, and
I take up math classes. That's my hobby, and I spend time with family on
Sunday afternoon."

When asked about his purpose in life, Alok says: "I honestly haven't
thought about it. But what excites me on a day-to-day basis is problem
solving. It could be any area. That is why I like being in startups."

Life after starting up

While Alok initially planned to start a healthcare company, he ended up
starting a fintech company and disbursing loans. He says, "When I came
out of Canaan, I had three business ideas - one was Indifi, which is
about lending business to SMEs. The second idea was largely about
chronic disease management, and I made an investment in it, and also
committed another investment in the space recently. The third idea was
about supplementary education. And soon, I landed up investing in a
company in that space. So, there were three ideas at that time, out of
which I have invested in two ideas, and the third idea was Indifi."

When asked about how Indifi is standing out in a sector which has 120
startups, out of which about 50 are funded, he says, "Yes, there are a
lot of lending platforms currently. The way Indifi operates is we
actually go to the root cause of why SMEs are under-funded in India. We
thought the root problem is that this industry suffers from a
'one-size-fits-all' problem. The product and credit assessment criteria
for SMEs are all the same regardless of what small business one is
running. Different industries carry different risks and have different
product needs. So, we are building Indifi around some of these industry
verticals and that's our unique model."

Today, the startup serves about 10,000 active customers. According to
Alok, their goal is to serve 1,00,000 active customers in the next four
to five years.

"Different players in the lending segment have chosen to address
different kinds of customers. We are for micro and small customers, and
provide access to unsecured loans for Rs 1 lakh to Rs 50 lakh. In our
case, the average lending price is Rs 5 lakh," he says.

Go-to-Market strategy

"We go to the ecosystem that our customers are already using. So, if we
want to go to restaurants, we will go and partner with Swiggy or Zomato.
If we want to go to travel agents, we will go to Travel Boutique or TSI
Yatra. And the good thing is that customers don't have to leave the
ecosystem to avail the credit. Second is the online medium, where the
customers come to our site and end up applying to us," he says.

Journey from being an entrepreneur to an investor

"There is a marked difference between angel investing and VC investing.
In a VC investment, you are managing other people's money, whereas in
angel investment you have more liberty because you are managing your own
money," says Alok.

Given the fact that he has spent four years in Indify, Alok reveals that
he doesn't have to work hard to source angel investing opportunities.
"Most of my angel opportunities comes from within the network. I tend to
look whether the idea is compelling, or the problem is real and
exciting. The second is the quality of the entrepreneur. At the stage
where I invest in, there is very little data available. So, it's a high
risk and hopefully high reward profile of investments."

"Like it happens in all startup businesses, almost all of your returns
are driven by top ten percent of your investments. So, my investments
also followed the same trajectory," says Alok.

One of his top portfolio investments was in Qikwell Technologies, a
doctor appointment platform. The startup was later sold to Practo. His
other investment was in a firm that built online poker products and got
sold to a casino company in Goa. "I am also lucky to participate in an
investment in Curofy that built a network of doctors and got acquired by
Roundglass Partners. These are some of the startups that gave me good
returns. But I am hoping that the biggest winners are still in my
portfolio," he says.

Alok's other portfolio startups are LifCare, CueLearn, Letsventure,
Adda52, BiteClub, Supafoods, Autoflik, and many others. When asked about
whether he puts the "first cheque" or would like simultaneous
investments, he says, "I would not like to be on the follow-on round.
It's just less fun to do that."

On being asked what markets did well for him when he was a VC, and what
is doing well for him as an angel investor, he says, "During Canaan,
internet services like Bharat Matrimony and Car Trade did well for us.
Outsourced services were ok for us. Equitas also did well for us. As an
angel investor, if I have to pick, I think healthcare has done well for
me. As far as spaces that have not done well for me, I would say that
some companies have not done well for me, rather than spaces that
haven't done well."

Speaking about startup failures, Alok says, "Most startups fail because
they had a wrong reading of the risks involved, and not because the
entrepreneurs weren't committed. Within my failed startup portfolios, if
some founders come up with a new idea, I would back them again."

On his thoughts of becoming an entrepreneur again after being a VC, Alok
says, "VCs don't really solve problems. They back problem solvers. So,
the only problem we are solving is how to pick the right entrepreneur.
After having done that for 10 years, I felt like I wanted to be a
problem solver again and sitting in front of customer."

VC-Funded Bubble Forming In India? Ryan Andreas, Quantified Commerce

Indian Technology news

June 26, 2018 Tuesday

Length: 804 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Jun. 26 -- India's E-commerce market is buzzing with startup
activity as Internet usage skyrockets. But, as the market becomes
increasingly saturated with startups, many Indian entrepreneurs say that
they find themselves in the middle of a tech bubble, and that it's close
to bursting. We spoke to Quantified Commerce, a vertically integrated
company within the beauty E-commerce market, on how building a
bootstrapped company is the way to go if you're trying to build a
sustainable business.

There was a dot-com bubble in the United States in 1997, which burst
between 2000 and 2002. The rate of Internet usage was rapidly growing in
the U.S., as it is now in India. This lead entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists to see enormous opportunity in the market. Sadly, thousands
of startups overestimated that opportunity. Not many fledgling dot-coms
survived the burst ... except of course Amazon and eBay.

Since the situation in India so closely parallels what happened in the
U.S., entrepreneurs fear a similar fate. A recent report that surveyed
170 entrepreneurs across 15 industries revealed that 65% of them feared
that India was at the center of an expanding tech bubble.

Despite many thinking that it is in the center of a bubble, within the
last two years, over 40% of Indian startups have shut down. That's about
1,000 startups that closed up shop. Most cited a lack of funding. But,
their failures may be because of operational inefficiencies and touting
a high gross merchandise volume (GMV).

GMV is essentially a vanity metric. It is flaunted as a measure of
success and often talked about like it's the same as revenue. The GMV is
the sale price charged per item multiplied by the number of items sold.
The only revenue is the commission they make off the sale of the item.
Many of these failed companies were relying on GMV instead of
considering cash flow and working capital.

The E-commerce sector was among the hardest hit. Online apparel
retailers like Fashionara and DonebyNone were two major casualties of
the segment. But, despite the failures of some, there are still ample
opportunities for many.

While China is steadfastly holding the number one position for the
largest E-commerce market in the world. India is coming up as the
fastest growing. The market is expected to grow 1,200% by the year 2026.
This presents itself as an irresistible opportunity for the
entrepreneurially-inclined. The fastest-growing segment is beauty and
wellness, where Quantified Commerce is deeply-rooted.

Despite the failure of many startups within E-Commerce within the last
couple of years, Quantified Commerce has been experiencing legitimate
growth from year to year. They've experienced 100%-300% growth each year
for the past three to four years. "Our focus is on

efficiency," says Ryan Andreas, co-founder of Quantified Commerce."We
could be growing a lot faster, but we believe in profitable growth and
we do not want growth just for the sake of growth like most vc-funded
companies. We have not lost money in a single year of operation in the
Indian E-commerce space, and we have reinvested all the profits. We are
completely bootstrapped"

Andreas suggests becoming more self-reliant. "We are bootstrapped for a
reason," Andreas said. "The problem with a lot of these Indian start ups
is that they're burning through VC-funding without using their creative
problem solving skills and ingenuity. India is a very different market
and you cannot simply copy what happens in the west blatantly. Throwing
money at problems is always the easy way out, but usually not the best
idea."

Another reason why Quantified Commerce has seen the success it has is
because it's basing its growth on real metrics as opposed to vanity
metrics. "We don't base our growth on things like the number of times
our social media posts were viewed, or how many times we were tweeted
about, or how many visitors we had on our website" says Andreas "Our
growth is based on real-hard data like profits and revenues and customer
feedback. We use lean startup on every part of the business model and
test every idea before we invest in it."

Quantified Commerce is run at peak efficiency, by streamlining the
supply chain and focusing on peak performance in all their processes,
including automation in the manufacturing phase. "Surviving a VC-bubble
in India is possible, if that's what this actually is, but startups need
to calculate legitimate growth, be more efficient, and self-sufficient,
for that matter."

While a VC-funded bubble in India is still speculative, there are things
that a startups can do to make sure they remain stable if the market
takes a sudden downward turn. Basing growth on real metrics and not
vanity metrics, and making your company as lean as possible will help
startups survive a potential burst.

How startups should prepare to get IP rights

MINT

March 28, 2023 Tuesday

Copyright 2023 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 715 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, March 28 -- In 2016, the government put in place the scheme
Startups Intellectual Property Protection (SIPP) with an aim to promote
awareness and acquisition of IPR rights among startups and to nurture
innovative technologies.

The scheme provided access to high-quality IP services and resources to
startups.

Under this scheme, facilitators, or IP Mitras, were empanelled to assist
startups in filing and processing their patent, design or trademark
applications.

The fees of such facilitators were borne by the Office of the Controller
General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks.

The scheme provides other benefits, too.

Startups can avail patent, trademark, and design services by paying only
the required statutory fees and need not pay the professional fees.
Instead, the government pays the nominal professional fee for the
services related to procuring IPR to the advocates or trademark agents
in charge of handling the IPR process.

This scheme was extended a couple of times in the past and will lapse on
31 March, unless the government decides to continue with it. So, how
should startups prepare to seek and protect their IP rights after 31
March? Here are some steps they can take.

Prioritizing IP Protection

Startups should evaluate and prioritize the evaluation of IP rights
involved in their business. Failure to identify or prioritize IP rights
is likely to create problems for the business and future investors or
while exiting the business, especially during negotiations. Sometimes IP
rights are the only asset available with a startup.

IPR registration

It is important to register certain IP rights before claiming
protection. However, it might not be mandatory for all rights. For
instance, there is no need for mandatory registration in the case of
trademarks and copyrights. On the other hand, registration for patents
and designs is necessary. Nevertheless, a registered IP right carries a
greater value and acts as evidence of the use of the IP rights before
courts as well as enforcement agencies.

Due diligence

It is important for a startup that it does not violate any other person
or startup's IP rights. This will help to protect them from
unanticipated legal action, which can prove to be a hindrance in its
business activities. So, startups should make IP decisions carefully and
conduct proper due diligence on IP rights that it is using or intends to
use.

IP documentation

It is important to have proper documentation done before filing for a
patent or trademark to reduce the possibility of rejection.
Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with employees should be effectuated
timely so that the intellectual property is protected by proper
agreement between the owner and third party or a key employee in a
startup.

Resource allocation

It is important to allocate resources for IP filing as there are certain
statutory fees involved. The statutory fee for filing patents for a
natural person or a startup, or others alone with startups for an online
application, is Rs.1,600 and Rs.8,000, respectively. Startups can hire a
patent attorney or a law firm that will help with filing and
documentation.

It is in the long-term interest of startups to have an Intellectual
Property Policy for the management of various IP rights which they may
own already or may acquire in future. Such a policy would ensure there
is no dispute among the founders, which is one of the main reasons for
the failure of startups.

Challenges

Once the SIPP scheme ends, the startups might have to look for law firms
and attorneys to get guidance and legal assistance, which they were able
to get under one roof in the scheme. They will have to allocate
resources for expenses, which were earlier covered in the scheme, for
activities like legal guidance and filing of the application for patent
protection.

Further, they will have to rely on other schemes to get rebates and
benefits. The government would have to look for new initiatives to help
create awareness amongst startups for IP protection.

KAnalysis. Views are personal.

The reason Pankaj Agarwal, CEO of Taghive, lives in Suwon is that he
formerly worked there with Samsung, which founded its electronics arm in
the city in 1969. Suwon, south of Pangyo, now hosts a former chip fab
converted into a vast R & D center, heavily manned by expatriates, and
is central to a range of satellite Samsung offices and plants.

Pangyo has emerged as South Korea's leading hub for startups. Photo:
Asia Times/Andrew SalmonFinancial spigotsThe conglomerate's in-house
tech incubator Samsung C-Lab is the body that supplied Agarwal with his
start-up capital. While some have accused large companies that incubate
small companies as foxes guarding hen houses, Agarwal's experience has
been positive.After arriving in South Korea in 2004, the Indian national
was chosen to do a master's program at the elite Seoul National
University, then an MBA at Harvard, both sponsored by Samsung. He
subsequently became an advisor to the CTO. When Agarwal advised the
company to create an internet-of-things device for children, he was
encouraged to first create a small team within Samsung, then spin it
off. Samsung C Lab invested the seed money.Argawal values Taghive at
approximately US$10 million. Pangyo's proximity to Samsung executives in
Seoul and Suwon is handy and Samsung has a seat on his board and he
receives consulting from the company.Lee Jung-won's chip
security/solution firm ICTC, which employs 72 staff - including a group
of in-house hackers who have shifted from poachers to gamekeepers -
boasts a broad spectrum of investors.They include local VCs, a matching
government fund and Korean banks. Like Agarwal, he also has big-boy
backing in Hyundai Motor. ICTK is creating secure software for the
sensors of autonomous vehicles - where a hacked system could be fatal -
for the auto giant, which has representation on his board.Recent startup
Smile Shark's funding comes from Lee - based on a proximate, personal
relationship.'I did not expect to co-found a company with him,' said Lee
of Smile Shark's founder, Chang Jin-hwan. 'But we are all in Pangyo.'

SalmonFinancial nigglesStill, Pangyo is becoming a victim of its own
success. The speculation that drove Gangnam rents skyward has spilled
south.'We have no complaints [about Pangyo] - just rents. They are huge,
and they are going up,' said Lee. 'If a company has its own building it
is good, but if you have to lease … in 2014, [the local government] gave
free rents for a couple of months, but now …'   Pangyo blends millennial
architecture with plentiful open spaces. Photo: Asia Times/Andrew
SalmonA larger financial problem is a shortage of venture finance. In
that regard, neither Pangyo - nor Korea - holds a candle to Silicon
Valley or the United States.'If I call someone in Silicon Valley, I can
get a million dollars, but here, nothing happens on the phone and even
if you meet, the risk appetite is not here,' said Agarwal. 'You spend
too much time pitching to investors. You don't waste that time in
Silicon Valley.''In the US you have enough capital, and you have exit
players who come back to invest,' agreed Lee. 'In the US, the big
players are risk players … here, private money is very
conservative.'Nathan Millard, a British PR executive who specializes in
startups, notes that while Korean VCs are plentiful - indeed, in
Gangnam, venture capitalists are a dime a dozen - the sums they can
offer are, generally, in the sub-$20 million range. 'If you want $50
million, $100 million or half a billion, you need someone to connect you
to Wall Street,' he said.While Korea boasts an impressive national flock
of 10 unicorns, only one grew as a result of local capital, Millard
said.   3D printers and inspirational slogans. Photo: Asia Times/Andrew
Salmon Overseas players have taken note.'Eighty percent of Pangyo is
tech companies, and they generated about $80 billion in 2018,' Lee
Eun-se, managing director of startup accelerator Techstars Korea, told
Asia Times. 'It is not only a smaller version of Silicon Valley, it is
liquid in its potential.'Lee opened Colorado-based Techstars' Korean
office in Pangyo in January. Why Pangyo? 'We want to be hands-on with
the companies we fall in love with,' he said. He is looking to support
10 startups, and is eying firms in enterprise software, human-digital
interfaces and frontier technologies.Meanwhile, Seoul leads the
financial charge into startups.Government wades inKorea has long
benefitted from top-down economic management. Its first industrial
revolution in the 1960s grew out of Seoul's plans to create a national
and industrial infrastructure via favored companies. That strategy
birthed giants including Samsung, Hyundai and LG.The second industrial
revolution of the 1990s blossomed after Seoul laid a world-class digital
backbone of broadband internet and mobile telecoms. That engendered
portals Naver and Daum, gaming firms NCSoft and Nexon and messenger app
Kakao.This background - and the need for economic diversification in a
top-heavy economy - may explain plentiful government support.

Korea Venture Investment Corp - it is a mother fund, like the Israeli
case,' said Lee. 'The government has to promote ventures - it is risky
to put everything into Samsung and Hyundai.''There is much more
government support for Korean startups than anywhere else I know of -
even Israel or Singapore -- in terms of volume of funding,' added
Millard. 'For example, the Tech Incubation Program Startup, or TIPS,
which is 100% government-run, will match a VC investment by up to KRW900
million [$754,000].'Park Kyeong-seon, an official with the
government-run Korea Institute of Startup and Entrepreneurship
Management, or KISED, told Asia Times that startups are eligible for
three phases of funding, each worth KRW100,000. Last year, the Ministry
of Startups and Entrepreneurship disbursed a budget of four trillion
won, she said.The government also operates physical facilities. Pangyo's
Global Startup Campus - a dedicated all-under-one-roof space for
startups - is run by the National IT Promotion Association.Even
Samsung-funded Argawal appreciates Seoul's programs. 'This is a
government-leased space, it is subsidized. We pay 50%,' he said of his
office. 'There is a café, a gym and downstairs we have 3D printers.'Too
much of a good thing?Given the difficulty startups previously
encountered in Korea's staid finance sector, the trend looks positive.
However, a source told Asia Times that too many bodies support startups
without a control tower: multiple ministries, local governments, big
companies (that have been strong-armed into the space by government) and
quasi-governmentals all have skin in a game, but no coordination.And
some say Seoul throws too much cash and too little knowledge at
ventures.'There are a lot of companies in Pangyo without a lot of
supportive infrastructure. It is not a mature ecosystem,' said American
Ogan Gurel, a former Pangyo resident and current professor at Daegu
Institute of Science and Technology. 'It lacks the diversification that
defines Silicon Valley - marketing, professional services, that sort of
thing.'The co-founder of a Seoul-based industrial design boutique of
international repute contrasted the government's profligacy toward
startups with its parsimony toward extant SMEs.'Kids with stupid ideas'
easily access government funds she said - funds that are wasted not just
due to the customary high failure rate of startups, but also due to the
absence of business support. Meanwhile, established SMEs have no such
spigot to tap. 'We could use that money to employ more staff!' she
complained.Formerly a mentor in a government-run program for startups,
she exited in disgust.This is the second part of a two-part series. Part

14 Tips to Build a Highly Efficient Software Team for Your Startup

Startups face multiple risks, and hence it requires a highly efficient
marketing staff and a strong development team. A software development[1]
company can either take your business to the top or bring it down to the
bottom. Hence, you need a highly technical and reliable team that
supports a common goal, i.e., to grow your venture. The process of
developing software is entirely different from that of an established
business.

This is because startups don't have significant experience in developing
ground-breaking software solutions.14 Tips to Build a Highly Efficient
Software Team for Your StartupHence, for a startup, hiring and building
a high-performing software team is stressful. According to CB
Insight[2]​s,[3] almost a quarter of startups fail because they don't
have an efficient team in place. Apart from building a talented team,
startups also need to maintain a healthy work culture to achieve
excellence. Don't worry — this post has got you covered. Here are the
top 14 tips that will help your startup build a fantastic development
team that will take your business a notch up. Planning Your Budget
Establish a Favorable Company Culture Have a Concrete Hiring Plan Hire
Skilled and Experienced Developers Never Neglect Soft Skills Equip your
Team with Appropriate Tools Establish a Work Schedule Everyone is Happy
With Invest in Team Development Look For Passion, Energy and
Complementary Skills Consider Full Stack Developers Invest in
Problem-Solving and Communication Hire a Core Development Team Get Smart
About Managing Things Build Emotional Safety and Trust Let's look at
each of these tips in detail.1) Planning Your BudgetAs a startup[4], you
might be short of cash flows in the beginning. Hence, you need to keep
in mind the latest technology, infrastructure, and project requirements
to build your engineers' team. Once you do that, you would be able to
gauge how much you need to spend on the resource and infrastructure
part. This exercise will also help you to gauge how and when you need to
scale up your team and infrastructure.2) Establish a Favorable Company
CultureYou need to create a work culture[5] that helps your development
team to excel in projects. Besides, you need to entrust your employees
and motivate them to take ownership of tasks assigned and make apt
decisions. You also need to ensure that your team is driven by passion,
patience, and resilience and that they're driven by a single goal.
Having said that, you can hire a software team and assign roles​ that
enable the creation of a thriving atmosphere.3) Have a Concrete Hiring
PlanFor having a technically strong team, you need to have a robust
hiring plan. Your hiring plan should include hiring team members in the
hierarchy right from the senior to the fresher level. You also have to
think about how many resources you'd want to allocate to the project,
the number of hours your potential resources would spend, and the
salaries you'd offer.4) Hire Skilled and Experienced DevelopersThe
thought of heading over to college campuses and recruiting fresh
graduates is overwhelming. They will happily accept entry-level
salaries. However, a startup must be hiring software developers​ who
bring their​ experience and knowledge to the table. Experienced
developers are subject matter experts with vast experience in
application development, and collaborating with them will help you
deliver satisfactory results. One thing you must keep in mind while
finding and hiring talent is that you are not recruiting for an already
scaling company. You are hiring for what your startup will become.5)
Never Neglect Soft SkillsSuppose you make the mistake of hiring an
employee who's excellent at their job but lacks people and communication
skills; they might end up proving out as a wrong recruit. Just as hard
skills are vital for the project to keep going, soft skills such as
communication, leadership, and negotiation are critical for your
startup's success. Your team members should interact adequately, honor
each other, and should manage conflicts. Soft skills help people to work
in harmony.6) Equip your Team with Appropriate ToolsWhen you automate
routine tasks, you give your software team the proficiency of
concentrating on more complex problems. Work closely with your team to
identify what they need to work efficiently and choose tools that enable
effective collaboration and communication[6]. Some tools that you must
plan to use could be security, customer relationship management, project
management, testing, and release management tools.7) Establish a Work
Schedule Everyone is Happy WithYou will face such times when deadlines
are approaching, and you need to meet them. In such a scenario, you must
ensure that your team doesn't get overwhelmed with the work. You can do
this by setting up a schedule that furnishes your development team with
enough hours to complete their delegated tasks. Besides, they should
also get enough time for rejuvenation and recoup. Also, it will be
beneficial if you offer flexible timing to your team. Many studies show
that people are often wired to give their best when allowed to work at
different times of the day. Along with that, you should also offer
performance incentives and yearly bonuses to make your team feel
valued.8) Invest in Team DevelopmentSupport your employee's overall
development by granting them allowances for courses, skill development,
etc. This will keep them updated with the latest tools and technologies.
The investment made in enhancing your team's skills will show up
eventually in the work they produce.9) Look For Passion, Energy and
Complementary SkillsPeople who love their work and can walk the extra
mile to accomplish a task will always help you push your goals. Besides,
you can also look for people with complementary skills. Ideally, you
should hire people who have a unique skill set from you. A team with
staff that has complementary skills works best. Having said that, look
for people with whom you can work well and those who share a similar
vision as yours.10) Consider Full Stack DevelopersA startup should
recruit people who know the job. This way, it becomes easy for you to
manage. Hiring full-stack developers for your startup is a worthy choice
to get started with. They'll take care of both your frontend and
backend.11) Invest in Problem-Solving and CommunicationConflicts within
your software team may result in severe hurdles for the efficiency and
performance of the entire team. Consider taking explicit measures to
resolve disputes and manage your team proactively. For instance, if you
have a team member with considerable talent but poor work ethic, the
cooperation will not work out as expected no matter how hard you try.12)
Hire a Core Development TeamIn the beginning, all that matters is the
core team. The only people you should hire are those​ with skills you
can't do without. You can add other roles at a later stage when the
startup progresses. If you start hiring broadly or without a specific
reason, you will end up wasting money and other resources that could
have been used more wisely to help your startup grow[7]. Hence, hire
only those people in your software team whom you need.13) Get Smart
About Managing ThingsYou are aware that collecting data will enable you
to make smarter decisions about marketing, pricing, software features,
and several other facets of your business. Have you started using data
to manage your team as well? Several savvy managers already use data
about their team members' traits and statistical models to enable their
teams to excel in the quality of work delivered and productivity.14)
Build Emotional Safety and TrustThe best teams encompass members[8] who
feel free to communicate through their minds. Whenever they face a
shortcoming or problem, they are aware that it should be brought to
light, without fearing retribution or ridicule. Emotional safety
enhances the confidence level of your team, improves productivity, and
strengthens the relationship. Give the liberty of sharing their inputs
to all your employees, make them comprehend that their views are
respected and that you take them seriously. An emotionally strong team
will help you inculcate a feeling of trust and would do your job without
any bottlenecks. Image Credit: fauxels; pexels; thank you! Vikrant

Chennai: Leaving a high paying job to pursue a passion is the second
nature of a millennial employee. But is it feasible to come back to the
old job after dabbling in something totally different? HR recruiters and
companies see a 20% increase in the number of applicants who return to
their old line of work after having experimented diverse options.The
information technology (IT) industry sees the highest number of
returnees, recruiters add.

"Organisations too factor in the value addition the employees' diversity
of experience brings in. Although such profiles are viewed at with
caution owing to their instability in career, the applicants are on the
rise," said Aditya Mishra, CEO, Ciel HR ServicesCompanies, which see the
growth in diversity at 15%-25%, say that while the diversity of profiles
is on the rise, core skills matter. Neeraj Sharma, senior HR director at
Fourkites said that as long as the tech expertise is intact, a break
from the routine is welcome. "Teaching is one of the areas that
candidates come back from. There, we look for problem solving skills and
strength in fundamentals - which is a strong trait in those with an
academic background," he said.Millennials experiment with career options
and join startups in other areas. Failure of startups make mid-career
professionals return to their original industry domain, recruiters said.
Salaries, however, depend on the extent of the diverse experiences
adding value to the candidate's employment in the new company."On some
lines, the break from the industry is viewed similar to an executive MBA
course that used to be common among mid and senior level professionals.
For instance, if the candidate takes a break to take up an AI
(artificial intelligence) project, he/she can expect a pay hike of 25%,
which is higher than regular candidates who usually take home an
increment of 15%," said BN Thammaiah, CEO, Kelly Services.Industry
players say professionals look to go back to the industries they came
due to expectation mismatch or failed entrepreneurial pursuits. Expert
advice platform TapChief sees professionals with a 5-10 year experience
bracket returning to the industry. "On our platform, we suggest the
courses that need to be taken up for them to ease into the old industry,
catching up on the changes," said Shashank Murali, CEO, TapChief. For

Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar to meet Indian startups this week to
understand impact of SVB debacle

MINT

New Delhi, March 12 -- Union minister of state for information and
technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar will meet the representatives from the
country's startup community amid the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank
which has sent shockwaves across the globe.

In a tweet , the minister said," The SVB Financial closure is certainly
disrupting startups across world .Startups are an important part of
India Economy. I will meet wth Indian Startups this week to understand
their impact on them and how govt can help during this crisis.

The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is beginning to
spread around the world.

Startup founders in California's Bay Area are panicking about access to
money and paying employees. Fears of contagion have reached Canada,
India and China. In the UK, SVB's unit is set to be declared insolvent,
has already ceased trading and is no longer taking new customers. On
Saturday, the leaders of roughly 180 tech companies sent a letter
calling on UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to intervene.

"The loss of deposits has the potential to cripple the sector and set
the ecosystem back 20 years," they said in the letter seen by Bloomberg.
"Many businesses will be sent into involuntary liquidation overnight."

This is just the beginning. SVB had branches in China, Denmark, Germany,
India, Israel and Sweden, too. Founders are warning that the bank's
failure could wipe out startups around the world without government
intervention. SVB's joint venture in China, SPD Silicon Valley Bank Co.,
was seeking to calm local clients overnight by reminding them that
operations have been independent and stable.

Bangladesh's startup scenario: 2023 may look up

The Financial Express (Bangladesh)

January 22, 2023 Sunday

Dhaka, Jan. 22 -- Bangladesh's startup scene is currently in the midst
of a metamorphosis, turning into a veritable hotbed of innovation and
enterprise. New businesses are blooming, old ones are scaling, and
Bangladesh's startup ecosystem is thriving.

The inception and proliferation of startup enterprises are a testament
to the country's burgeoning entrepreneurial acumen.

Many local startups in Bangladesh have been able to secure funding and
partnerships and have been expanding their operations both locally and
internationally.

The recent performance of localised startup entities within Bangladesh
has been a testament to their capability for securing financial backing
and strategic alliances and their propensity for expansion on both
domestic and global fronts. There have also been success stories of
local startups that larger companies have acquired.

Startups that are faring well

ChalDal is an online grocery platform offering household items for
delivery and was awarded as the best e-commerce company of 2020 by
Digital World for providing essentials during COVID. Praava Health
offers easy and affordable healthcare in Bangladesh via mobile app, with
15-minute appointment slots, 250+ unique lab tests, and the country's
first PCR lab for molecular cancer diagnosis.

SureCash is a fast-growing mobile payment system in Bangladesh,
currently available through six banks and over 650 partners. ShopUp is a
B2B commerce platform for small businesses providing easy access to
sourcing, logistics, digital credit, and business management solutions.

PriyoShop is an e-commerce platform selling a wide range of products,
connecting retailers to suppliers and big brands to fix the fragmented
supply chain by technology. Maya is an online service that helps people
with mental and physical health issues, using AI, machine learning and
natural language processing to connect users with 300+ licensed
healthcare experts, with 10 million unique users, expanding to India,
Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries.

Shikho is an ed-tech company focusing on digitising education in
Bangladesh, and it provides personalised learning, feedback, and
assessment for students using gamification techniques for classes 6 to
12 and coaching for JSC, SSC, and HSC exams.

Another prominent startup venture in the country is Pathao, an on-demand
digital platform company headquartered in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which
started as a delivery service in 2015 and now offers ride-sharing, food
delivery, courier, and e-commerce services in four cities in Bangladesh
and two cities in Nepal, becoming the first ride-sharing service
provider in Bangladesh to get enlistment certificates from authorities.

Big fundings

In recent years, many local startups in Bangladesh have successfully
raised funding from venture capital firms, angel investors, and
platforms. These startups are in various fields, such as technology,
agriculture, and e-commerce.

Some have also successfully gotten international funding and
partnerships with foreign companies.

In 2022, Bangladeshi startups raised USD 90 million, reported Dhaka
Tribune. The top B2B e-commerce platform, ShopUp, raised USD 65 million
in June, and the top B2C e-commerce platform, 10 Minute School, earned
USD 2 million from Surge in January.

Edtech startup Shikho raised USD 4 million in seed funding in March,
taking its total funding to USD 5.3 million, the highest seed funding
for a Bangladeshi startup.

Another startup, Shajgoj, raised USD 2.3 million for its fashion
e-commerce platform, marking a significant increase in funding for
Bangladeshi startups.

Startups that struggled

Failure is a commonly discussed theme within the startup ecosystem.
Startups fail for various reasons, but common causes include lack of
market need, insufficient funding, poor business model, poor execution,
lack of focus and failure to adapt. 2022 has seen some failed ventures,
too, that were considered the next big shots.

Covid-19 has caused 25 per cent of Bangladeshi startups to close, and 56
per cent of startups have seen at least a 50 per cent drop in revenue,
according to a study by LightCastle Partners.

Umbrii, The Tech School, Incogmito, Joldi, and Online Kenakata are five
Bangladeshi startups that recently shut down operations.

Umbrii was a social media management startup, and the Tech School was a
coding and electronics education institute. Incogmito emerged as an
anonymous social networking platform. Joldi aimed to provide on-demand
delivery services, while Online Kenakata was a marketplace.

Why 2023 looks bright

Over 1,200 registered startups in Bangladesh in 2022 generated more than
1.5 million employment.

According to UN ESCAPE 2022, Bangladesh's tech-based and online
education startups are poised for growth in 2023, with government
targets to export USD 5 billion by 2025.

High digital adoption and a large number of STEM graduates are driving
the ICT sector's 40 per cent annual growth and 1 per cent contribution
to GDP.

The country is also a leading supplier of online labour, with 650,000
registered freelancers generating USD 100 million annually. Investment
and knowledge remittance are on the rise as Non-Resident Bangladeshis
establish technology-oriented businesses in the country, incentivised by
investor-friendly policies.

There is also a good chance of farming startups in 2023. Dhaka-based
Agroshift raised USD 1.8 million in seed funding, making it the
country's largest-ever pre-seed round for an agri-tech startup, helping
farmers sell products via a tech-enabled supply chain.

WeGro, another agri-tech startup, is looking to raise a big fund soon to
expand nationwide and impact 200,000 farmers by 2024. Both these
agri-tech ventures will inspire more such enterprises in the country,
hope experts.

From 10 Minute School to Online Kenakata, Bangladesh's startup scene is
constantly evolving. Globally, almost 90 per cent of startups fail
within 1 to 5 years of their operations. So some startups failing in
Bangladesh shouldn't be a big concern.

What is important is the fact that the country is now attracting fresh
ideas that are flourishing in the country's startup ecosystem. 2023,
hence, is expected to be even better in terms of startup growth compared
to 2022.

3 Tips for Global Business Expansion

Regardless of the timeline for your business, it's essential to plan[1]
for the future. Focusing only on the present without ambitious goals is
a recipe for failure. Once a startup is established in the local market,
it is time to move on to international expansion[2]. And for this, you
need a clear road map.

Harvard Business Review's study[3] on the role of business planning in
startup success revealed that founders with a business plan for
expansion were 16% more likely to achieve viability than those without a
plan. Entrepreneurs focused on startup growth are 7% more likely to plan
with forward-thinking ideas.

More than 60%[4] of scaling efforts can succeed. This impressive fact
attracts investors who are more willing to invest in the projects of
founders who understand that real value comes from being able to boost
startups and scale them globally.

While the Internet is full of articles to help you create a business
plan, I want to share some essential tips on planning international
expansion. I came up with them from my experience expanding my company
into the Philippines and India. This knowledge will help you grow
faster, more efficiently and without financial losses.

Evaluate your expansion potential Entrepreneurs make the mistake of
thinking the biggest challenge in expansion is competition[5]. In
reality, only 20%[6] of startups fail because of getting outcompeted.

Russia Ignites West's Battle for Energy Independence

Putin's invasion of Ukraine has revealed the West's dependence on Russia
for their energy needs. Western countries are now scrambling for stable,
renewable energy. World leaders must find new sources of minerals, such
as copper, essential to their transition to energy independence.

Our experience has shown that the primary opponent in a new market is
the external market environment and uncertainty. When planning, you
should always count on a worst-case scenario and an unfriendly
environment.

Use these three practical exercises not to make too optimistic
forecasts.

Long-term planning. While planning results and activities for the year,
stop and think about how each aspect of your plan might not work. Have a
brainstorm with your team[7] and don't be afraid to discard ideas.

For instance, we made a mistake at one time of relying on the rapidity
of hiring sales managers in new markets. We expected it to take 3-4
weeks, but it took longer. We needed to consider the time for training,
adaptation and employee needs.

Short-term planning. When planning weekly checkpoints or sprints,
compare expectations and reality. Don't chase steep and big goals by
laying down unrealistic deadlines. The truth would be painful. In
short-term planning, the most helpful question is: "what are we not
doing now?" We discuss with our team what we won't do each week, why
we've put it off and what we're doing instead.

When the planning is done. When you've developed a plan and done a "what
can go wrong" exercise, involve external authoritative experts in a
similar practice. Show the completed project to experts[9] and let them
challenge it. At our company, we ask our investors to look at our plan
and assess the risks. This helps us evaluate our options and helps us
not to waste money, employee resources and time. TIP #2. Understand the
patterns of your business In a startup, teams depend[10] on each other.
This affects the performance of the enterprise as a whole. You, as an
entrepreneur, must clearly understand how these connections function. If
one element falls out, the whole system collapses. For example, a new
contract with a partner might get delayed for several weeks just because
the necessary document got lost in transition.

We faced this problem ourselves. An employee of our business development
department dropped out for two weeks. Without him, we couldn't get the
right contact for payments and weren't able to quickly solve the
customer's problems.

How could this situation have been prevented[11]? Consider team
relationships in the planning stage. Discuss who has access to accounts.
Plan around employee needs and avoid a situation where something
strategically important is left with one employee.

I suggest structuring your database with internal information and adding
a company rule of creating critical process manual documents, access
guidebooks, passwords and contacts. This protects you from the risk of a
total stoppage. TIP #3: Plan your hiring Hiring people
internationally[12] is a critical and challenging process. After all,
your performance depends on your staff, and it's crucial to learn how to
look for talent thousands of kilometers away.

To make the talent search and hiring process successful, I suggest
consulting with experts in the global market. Individual request
consulting is expensive, but every dollar pays off.

Related: 5 Things to Remember When Hiring International Employees[13]

Networking with other founders also works. Ask them about the
peculiarities of the local mentality, frequent mistakes of foreign
hiring companies, the average salary level and the importance of the HR
brand for candidates. Specify the little things - from the candidate's
preferred language to slang of address.

When you get the answers to these questions, be careful about predicting
the number of people you'll hire over any given period.

I faced this issue when my company expanded into the Philippines and
Indonesia. We did not know how to hire salespeople quickly. In the first
few months, we made less revenue than we could have. We quickly realized
we had not planned our hiring process as well as we should have.

Proper planning is the key to successful expansion[14] and business
development. However, over-optimism in planning leads to unnecessary
costs and problems. Always anticipate the worst-case scenario, plan your
hiring in as much detail as possible and give your plan to investors to
ensure you are following the right path for success.

7 Travel Stocks That Will Benefit as Covid Restrictions End[15] From sea
to shining sea, the green shoots of a re-opening are rapidly turning
into a forest of lush growth. That may sound a bit over the top, but
after two long years, it appears that 2022 will bring a return to travel
that resembles pre-pandemic levels. And if you still think that's
hyperbole, consider this:

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of
Washington estimates that 73% of Americans[16] are currently immune to
the omicron variant of Covid-19. At that level, many experts believe
that future surges will be less disruptive. And even Dr. Anthony Fauci
believes it's time for Americans to turn the page.

And that's why investors should start looking at travel stocks. To be
fair, this isn't a sector where investors will find many undervalued
stocks. In fact, many skeptics may say that these stocks have future
growth priced in.

That's a theory that is about to be tested in a big way. This is why
we've done some digging and are presenting you with seven stocks that
appear to offer some intriguing value as Americans make their travel
plans.

Corporate vs Startup jobs: find what suits you

Nextbigwhat.com

March 11, 2022 Friday

Copyright 2022 Pi All Rights Reserved

Length: 980 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, March 11 -- Corporate vs Startup jobs A thread.

A corporate job is likely to give you financial stability. The
probability of the next paycheck is higher. If money is a necessity,
then the choice works for you. If salary becomes an addiction, then the
choice works against you.

A startup job will throw you into an ocean of ambiguity. Where you will
have to navigate most of the journey yourself. If ambiguity doesn't
intimidate you, then the choice works for you. If ambiguity weakens you,
then the choice works against you.

A corporate job shows you the power of process and systems. Of planning
in advance towards an outcome far out. If you wish to aim and shoot,
then the choice works for you. If you to shoot and then check if you hit
the aim, then the choice works against you.

A startup job's flat hierarchy gives you access to the leadership. You
witness them up-close. If the comprehension gap between them and you
isn't wide, then the choice works for you. If its wide and you fail to
understand most of what they do, then the choice works against you.

A corporate job shows the power of teams. How the microcosm of your work
adds up to a collective outcome. If you love to see huge indirect
outcome of your work, the choice works for you. If you love to see micro
direct outcome of your work, the choice works against you.

A startup job tends to fail fast. Feedback loops are short and you get
to see the impact of your work quickly. If you tend to reflect on all of
your failures, the choice works for you. If you tend to move on quickly
from your failures, the choice works against you.

A corporate job requires you to communicate effectively, in order to
convince people to deploy resources. If you believe persuasion is just
as important as capability, the choice works for you. If you believe
your work should speak for itself, the choice works against you.

A startup job offer a very small probability of a very big life-changing
financial outcome. If taking risks comes naturally to you, the choice
may work for you. If taking risks isn't you, the choice may work against
you.

A corporate job more often than not comes with brand recognition. You do
not have to explain where you work. If the brand adds to your
credentials, the choices works for you. If you are doing it for social
validation, the choice works against you.

A startup job nurtures you as a generalist. You handle multiple roles at
the same time, while learning about them on the job. If you wish to
build a generalist profile, the choice works for you. If you wish to
specialize, the choice may not work for you.

A corporate job will discuss, debate before taking decisions. The damage
of a decision gone bad is far greater. If you love taking decisions by
analysis and conversation, the choice works for you. If you love taking
decisions by your gut, the choice works against you.

A startup job will offer you professional growth that is thrilling. You
will be given a mandate far bigger, far earlier than expected. If you
prefer given a role and then growing into it, the choice works for you.
If you prefer growing into a role, the choice works against you.

A corporate job will train you adequately for your role. It will offer
tools, skills, mentoring and feedback, at every step. If you prefer
structured learning, the choice works for you. If you prefer learning
via trial and error on the job, the choice works against you.

A startup job will come with transparent communication. You'll know how
the company is doing, how you are doing, more often than you would wish
to know. If transparency appeals to you, the choice works for you. If
radical candor is hard to digest, the choice works against you.

A debate on Corporate vs Startup jobs isn't about them. It is about you.
Where do you see yourself fitting in more? Where do you see yourself
growing more? Learning more? Failing better?

I started my career in a consulting firm, where everything was about
process and teams. Did that for 3 years, before starting a bootstrapped
venture. The concept of "structure" that I learnt at consulting, helped
me tremendously as a founder.

After 2 years, I went back to an executive role, this time at a really
large MNC. I learnt the power of processes, planning, methodical
execution. And also how large companies can crush your soul, if you are
not that person. I was not that person.

So after 4 years, I started up again, this time as VC backed. Leaving
the financial stability, prestige, power that came with the executive
role. The journey wasn't any easier, but it was enriching. I could see
how my 4 years of corporate role had shaped me as a leader.

After 5 years as a founder of a VC-backed venture, I am back to starting
up, bootstrapping yet again. Playing a very different game from what I
have played before.

I can see how an MBA, a consulting job, founder of a small bootstrapped
venture, an executive role in a multi-billion dollar tech startup, a
founder in a VC backed startup - have all contributed to get me to this
point.

What a corporate job or a startup job does to you, is a function of who
you are at that point of time in life. There is no right or wrong. You
define that. For yourself.

Those in a startup job, laughing at those in a corporate job, are
laughing at the same people that they themselves will soon become.

Those in a corporate job, laughing at those in a startup job, are
laughing at the same people they wish they could have become.

You do not become cool laughing at others. You become cool by being
yourself!

Every Friday I write a thread on personal growth, failures, startups,
organization building and more. You can follow me on @warikoo to get
them on your feed.

Women Must Build Their Personal Brands As Founders: Founder, Encubay

Business World

November 19, 2022

Copyright 2022 Business World, distributed by Contify.com All Rights

Length: 990 words

Byline: Nitesh Kumar

Body

Encubay, a diversity-focused network, has partnered with the United
States Consulate General, StrongHer Foundation, and MyStepUp to launch
the 'Fempreneurs Upskilling Program' in India.

It is hailed as the first and only comprehensive growth programme for
women entrepreneurs to help them acquire critical skills beyond
fundraising in order to grow their businesses. A sector-agnostic
programme for early-to-growth-stage female entrepreneurs from across the
country.

The following are edited excerpts from a conversation Deeksha Ahuja,
Founder of Encubay, had with BW Businessworld.

Why does entrepreneurship remain a male-dominated field?

Traditionally, the whole startup ecosystem in India is just about 10
years old. It's not like Silicon Valley, where we have 40 years of
startup experience. Now the wave of more women joining entrepreneurship
is really going to kick in because of the success stories. And a trend
will emerge only when there are success stories to share. People do not
talk about women entrepreneurs who have gotten funding from venture
capitalists (VCs) and built unicorns. A few of them have a valuation of
over INR 500 crore also, but they are not the talk of the town. All of
these changes occurred within the last five years.

Networking is one of the roadblocks for women founders.

The main problem female founders have is access to networks. Starting a
venture is not easy without access to the network of people in the
ecosystem. Men have such a strong network that even when they do not
have any ideas, they will first call five investors and say, "See, this
is what I am building." Would you like to do a small check on this?
Further, there is very little access to mentors, corporations, or
businesses.

Women entrepreneurs get only 2 percent of the VC money.

Even today, women entrepreneurs only get 2 percent of the VCs' funding.
Until and unless women get good access to networks and funding, we will
not witness female founders building huge companies and being talked
about. However, VCs want to back women because of ESG (environmental,
social, and governance) norms. Furthermore, they believe that female-led
ventures provide better returns. The field is ready, and as a female
founder, now is the best time for you to kick-start a business.

Initiatives to incubate small businesses run by women

First, you have to create access to a good network of people with whom
they can brainstorm ideas and investors with whom they can have a casual
conversation. Yes, women do need mentorship and guidance to think big
and have a very big vision. Because companies that portray a big vision
get funded.

Women must build their personal brands as founders; if you don't talk
about your personal brand and what you're building, no one will know.
The truth is, as an entrepreneur, you have to talk about your product or
brand from day zero. And last, as a startup, you need credits. Every
bank out there wants to really support diversity in the ecosystem, thus
lending their hands to support the women founders out there.

Self-employed women in India went from 55.6 percent in 2011-12 to less
than 53 percent in 2018-19. Why?

These figures do not account for the women's side hustles while working
full-time jobs, whether housework or office work. The way data is being
collected needs to be changed because most women entrepreneurs are not
part of a formal system. You will find women founders in a small
WhatsApp group, a Facebook community, or among peers. From 2018 to now,
I have seen a lot of developments, lots of success stories, and lots of
initiatives for female founders. The whole wave is ready to dive into
the startup ecosystem.

Failure is part and parcel of a successful venture.

Don't be afraid, even if your venture fails. Failures can provide some
of the most valuable learning opportunities. Failing in the startup
ecosystem is normal. We always glorify when a man fails; we should start
doing the same for women as well. When you build a venture, you create a
very strong network, which is the most important intangible asset. Those
relationships are not going anywhere.

Will more women in leadership lead to a more women-friendly work
culture?

Women at the top set very female-friendly or, as I would say, more
inclusive work policies. Definitely, more women in leadership are going
to lead a more women-friendly work culture because now you are setting
standards and goals for both genders. You are not leaving one gender
behind. Women bring a different perspective to boardrooms and leadership
positions, and these perspectives can sometimes be viewed from a very
strong economic standpoint.

The growth rate of women's entrepreneurship in India was at its highest
amid the pandemic times. Why?

Everything was online for the first time, and everyone had access. It is
now extended to everyone and is not restricted to just a certain set of
people. The playing field is level. Furthermore, women understand a wide
range of issues. Around 70 per cent of D2C (direct-to-home) brands have
female founders. When women themselves create products, they know all
the nuances. The addition of new sectors such as fin-tech and
health-tech opens up an array of opportunity for everyone, including
women. Moreover, everything went online, which gave them the confidence
to run a business successfully.

What major hindrances do you foresee in the sector?

Capital is a hurdle. However, at some level that is also broken out,
there are at least 7-8 female-focused funds. Furthermore, external
factors such as proper family support are essential. That is not a
hurdle that women should face. Society expects women to work full time
at their startups but also work full time at home, which is unfair; we
don't have the same expectations from men. Until and unless
everyone-families, husbands, and fathers-stands up and says, "We should
support female founders unconditionally and share things at home," the
journey will be difficult.

founder's journey. There are short profiles of successful startups as
well as practical worksheets and dashboard templates. See our book
review here.

Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know, by Adam Grant

Much success is attributed to expertise and consistency. But the ability
to discard old assumptions and reframe perspectives is also key to
success for entrepreneurs and leaders, as explained in this book by Adam
Grant, organisational psychologist at Wharton. The book has a mix of
research, storytelling, and tips for three levels of rethinking:
individual, interpersonal, and collective. See our book review here.

The Fail-Safe Startup, by Tom Eisenmann

The emotional, social, and economic costs of startup failure can be
severe. This book by Harvard Business School professor Tom Eisenmann
shows founders how to map the failure landscape and gear up for success.
It shares research frameworks and stories of seven startups who failed
for reasons like the false promise (misplaced confidence from early
success), false start (premature launch), and audacious goals
(unsuccessful moonshots). See our book review here.

Beyond Good: How Technology is Leading a Purpose-driven Business
Revolution, by Theodora Lau and Bradley Leimer

This informative book provides a range of frameworks and examples of
fintech startups in action. The authors are co-founders of
Unconventional Ventures, a consultancy in financial services innovation.
They show how fintech allows business leaders to embrace a sense of
purpose beyond just profits, and be catalysts for greater social
inclusion and equity, particularly in the hard times of the pandemic
era. See our book review here.

Future Tech: How to Capture Value from Disruptive Industry Trends, by
Trond Arne Undheim

This wide-ranging book shows how to find alignment between tech, policy,
business models, and social dynamics. Startups play a key role in future
innovation ecosystems, and it is the alignment between these four forces
that determine market success. Mastering the dynamics of this
interaction is key for winning in the future of knowledge work, as
explained by Trond Arne Undheim, futurist and venture partner at Antler
and Hitachi Ventures. See our review here.

Platform Scale for a Post-Pandemic World, by Sangeet Paul Choudary

The pandemic has further accelerated the power and reach of platform
businesses, as they expand across sectors. Big tech firms and
scale-stage startups are unleashing new value streams while also raising
concerns about concentration. Sangeet Paul Choudary, whose earlier books
are Platform Revolution and Platform Scale, breaks down the technology,
design, interaction, and trust components of the platform model.

Experiencing Design: The Innovator's Journey, by Jeanne Liedtka, Karen
Hold, and Jessica Eldridge

Going beyond tools and processes, the inner evolution of a design
thinker is well captured in the compelling new book spearheaded by
design thinking guru Jeanne Liedtka. It describes four personas in
design thinking: driver, influencer, analyst, and supporter. The authors
show how organisations can improve their competencies in each phase of
the design thinking journey. See our book review here.

Ecosystem, by iVEIN

This authoritative book is published by the Innovation Venturing and
Entrepreneurship in India Network (iVEIN), with contributions from 30
experts. The material spans four sections: innovation, incubation,
funding, and industry impact. For example, one chapter tracks the
broader impact of VC funding in the pandemic era, while another explores
75 collaboration programmes between corporates and startups, including
accelerators. See our book review here.

Startup Guide Egypt

The Startup Guide series of books, published by Sissel Hansen in
Copenhagen, covers the startup ecosystem in over 40 cities around the
world. Startup Guide Egypt extends the focus beyond Cairo to the Upper
and Lower regions of the country, with a particular emphasis on social
and environmental impact.

The publisher and editorial team deserve an award for the entire book
series, each of which features inspiring interviews with founders,
investors, accelerators and educators. We pick this title on Egypt
because it shines the spotlight beyond the usual startup hubs of the
world, and is one of the most picturesque startup books around! See our
book review here.

We look forward to your comments as well as your suggestions for books
to review in 2022. All of us at YourStory wish our readers and partners
a happy holiday season and a terrific year ahead in 'The Next Normal' -
may a million successful startups bloom!

FIFA World Cup 2022 | France into final with 2-0 win as Morocco go down
fighting

France will take on Argentina in the World Cup final after beating
Morocco 2-0 in an absorbing semi-final on December 14 to stay on course
for a successful title defence and end the fairytale run of the north
Africans in Qatar.

India slams Pakistan for raking up Kashmir issue in U.N.

India strongly hit back at Pakistan on December 14 after it raised the
Kashmir issue in the U.N. Security Council, asserting that a country
that hosted slain al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and attacked a
neighbouring Parliament does not have the credentials to "sermonise" in
the power U.N. organ.

Opposition walks out in Parliament over the India-China border issue

Opposition parties on Wednesday staged walk outs in both Houses of
Parliament after being denied a discussion on the India-China border
issue. In the Lok Sabha, the walk out was led by Congress leader Sonia
Gandhi. As soon as the Zero Hour began, Congress leader of the House,
Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, demanded that a discussion on the India-China
border situation be held and gave the example of late former Prime
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru allowing a discussion in the Lok Sabha on the
India-China war in 1962.

Centre tells Maharashtra, Karnataka to wait for Supreme Court judgment
on border issue

Amid the border row between Maharashtra and Karnataka, Union Home
Minister Amit Shah met the Chief Ministers of both States and asked them
to not claim any territory or make any demands till the Supreme Court
gives its verdict. Emerging from the meeting, Mr. Shah flanked by Chief
Ministers Eknath Shinde of Maharashtra and Basavaraj Bommai of Karnataka
said fake Twitter handles created in the name of senior politicians
played a role in whipping up emotions.

CBI lodged 15 cases for derogatory posts since 2019, says Centre

posts against the government and constitutional functionaries from 2019
to November 2022, Union Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh
said in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

Success rate of startups in India higher than in other countries: Piyush
Goyal

The government on Wednesday said that the success rate of startups in
India was much higher than in other countries of the world, and the
number of startups in the country had increased from 452 in 2016 to
84,012 till November 2022. Union Minister for Commerce Piyush Goyal said
in the Lok Sabha during Question House that startups were prone to
failures. "...There is a very high probability of failure of startups.
Though I must say, the success rate of startups in India is relatively
higher than the rest of the world...."

BSNL is going to be revived in a big way, says Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw

Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) had gone through a very bad phase
"primarily" due to political parties during the UPA government, and was
used like a "cash cow" by certain people who were still Members of
Parliament, the Union Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw
said during Question Hour, on Wednesday.

Specific date will be given for pleas on Article 370, says Supreme Court

Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Wednesday assured a specific
date will be given for hearing a series of petitions challenging the
abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which deprived Jammu and
Kashmir of its special privileges and led to the bifurcation of the
State in 2019.

Madhya Pradesh Minister objects to Deepika Padukone's costume in Pathaan

Targeting actor Deepika Padukone for her costumes in her upcoming film
Pathaan, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra on Wednesday
hinted at a possible ban on the film in the State. Referring to the
film's recently released track Besharam Rang, Mr. Mishra - who is the
official spokesperson for the State government and has often taken aim
at various films and filmmakers for what he considers "objectionable
content" in the past - demanded that such "visuals be corrected".

BJP MP from Manipur says India losing territory to Myanmar along Manipur
border

A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member from Manipur said in Rajya Sabha
on Wednesday that India was losing territory along the Manipur-Myanmar
border due to faulty border pillars and demanded that the issue be taken
up diplomatically with the neighbouring country.

Interview | You cannot think of cinema as a timepass: Adoor
Gopalakrishnan

The tumultuous bus journey that a young couple took in 1972 continues to

The Maharashtra Government has constituted a 13-member committee to
collect details of couples in interfaith and inter-caste marriages, and

We spoke to Quantified Commerce, a vertically integrated company within
the beauty E-commerce market, on how building a bootstrapped company is
the way to go if you're trying to build a sustainable business.

India&#x2019;s E-commerce market is buzzing with startup activity as
Internet usage skyrockets. But, as the market becomes increasingly
saturated with startups, many Indian entrepreneurs say that they find
themselves in the middle of a tech bubble, and that it&#x2019;s close to
bursting. We spoke to Quantified Commerce, a vertically integrated
company within the beauty E-commerce market, on how building a
bootstrapped company is the way to go if you&#x2019;re trying to build a
sustainable business.

There was a dot-com bubble in the United States in 1997, which burst
between 2000 and 2002. The rate of Internet usage was rapidly growing in
the U.S., as it is now in India. This lead entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists to see enormous opportunity in the market. Sadly, thousands
of startups overestimated that opportunity. Not many fledgling dot-coms
survived the burst &#x2026; except of course Amazon and eBay.&#xA0;

Since the situation in India so closely parallels what happened in the
U.S., entrepreneurs fear a similar fate. A recent report that surveyed
170 entrepreneurs across 15 industries revealed that 65% of them feared
that India was at the center of an expanding tech bubble.&#xA0;

Despite many thinking that it is in the center of a bubble, within the
last two years, over 40% of Indian startups have shut down.
That&#x2019;s about 1,000 startups that closed up shop. Most cited a
lack of funding. But, their failures may be because of operational
inefficiencies and touting a high gross merchandise volume (GMV).&#xA0;

GMV is essentially a vanity metric. It is flaunted as a measure of
success and often talked about like it&#x2019;s the same as revenue. The
GMV is the sale price charged per item multiplied by the number of items
sold. The only revenue is the commission they make off the sale of the
item. Many of these failed companies were relying on GMV instead of
considering cash flow and working capital.&#xA0;

The E-commerce sector was among the hardest hit. Online apparel
retailers like Fashionara and DonebyNone were two major casualties of
the segment. But, despite the failures of some, there are still ample
opportunities for many.

While China is steadfastly holding the number one position for the
largest E-commerce market in the world. India is coming up as the
fastest growing. The market is expected to grow 1,200% by the year 2026.
This presents itself as an irresistible opportunity for the
&#xA0;entrepreneurially-inclined. &#xA0;The fastest-growing segment is
beauty and wellness, where Quantified Commerce is deeply-rooted.&#xA0;

Despite the failure of many startups within E-Commerce within the last
couple of years, Quantified Commerce has been experiencing legitimate
growth from year to year. They&#x2019;ve experienced 100%-300% growth
each year for the past three to four years. &#x201C;Our focus is
on&#xA0;

efficiency,&#x201D; says Ryan Andreas, co-founder of Quantified
Commerce.&#x201C;We could be growing a lot faster, but we believe in
profitable growth and we do not want growth just for the sake of growth
like most vc-funded companies. We have not lost money in a single year
of operation in the Indian E-commerce space, and we have reinvested all
the profits. We are completely bootstrapped&#x201D;&#xA0;

Andreas suggests becoming more self-reliant. &#x201C;We are bootstrapped
for a reason,&#x201D; Andreas said. &#x201C;The problem with a lot of
these Indian start ups is that they&#x2019;re burning through VC-funding
without using their creative problem solving skills and ingenuity. India
is a very different market and you cannot simply copy what happens in
the west blatantly. Throwing money at problems is always the easy way
out, but usually not the best idea.&#x201D;

Another reason why Quantified Commerce has seen the success it has is
because it&#x2019;s basing its growth on real metrics as opposed to
vanity metrics. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t base our growth on things like
the number of times our social media posts were viewed, or how many
times we were tweeted about, or how many visitors we had on our
website&#x201D; says Andreas &#x201C;Our growth is based on real-hard
data like profits and revenues and customer feedback. We use lean
startup on every part of the business model and test every idea before
we invest in it.&#x201D;

Quantified Commerce is run at peak efficiency, by streamlining the
supply chain and focusing on peak performance in all their processes,
including automation in the manufacturing phase. &#x201C;Surviving a
VC-bubble in India is possible, if that&#x2019;s what this actually is,
but startups need to calculate legitimate growth, be more efficient, and
self-sufficient, for that matter.&#x201D;

While a VC-funded bubble in India is still speculative, there are things
that a startups can do to make sure they remain stable if the market
takes a sudden downward turn. Basing growth on real metrics and not
vanity metrics, and making your company as lean as possible will help
startups survive a potential burst.&#xA0;

How Tastewise uses artificial intelligence to bridge the gap between
consumers and food trends

Tastewise CEO and co-founder Alon Chen looked around the crowded
ballroom at Future Food-Tech’s San Francisco conference this spring.

The room was full of companies showing off new advances in food tech.
There were different variations of plant-based meats and sauces.
Ingredients made from unconventional plants, grains and legumes.
Technology to improve and enhance cell-based meat growth. All sorts of
products made through fermentation. He spoke matter-of-factly.

“If you look around us, nine out of 10 of the presenters are going to
fail, which is a shame, right?” he said.

Chen said that startup failure has nothing to do with a company’s idea
or how much the product is needed. It has more to do with the way those
products are executed, what attributes they highlight, and how well they
fit what consumers are looking for at the moment.

Tastewise’s goal is to turn that trend upside down.

“We're trying to get from a 90% failure rate to a 100% success rate,” he
said.

The Israel-based company has a unique value proposition, and Chen says
it has succeeded in work with food businesses of all sizes. Basically,
Tastewise has a sophisticated artificial intelligence system that sifts
through massive amounts of data online — the company estimates it
accesses more than 22 billion social media interactions, more than 5
million home recipes and more than 1 million restaurant menus — to find
what’s trending right now. And its co-founders know exactly where to
look and how to mine that data. Chen is a former Google executive, and
Chief Technical OfficerEyal Gaon has worked with several Israel-based
tech companies.

The company, which got its start in 2017, works with an array of food
makers including Nestlé, PepsiCo, Kraft Heinz, Campbell Soup and Eat
Just. It’s quickly tripled its revenues, the company said in a
statement. In March, it received a $17 million Series A investment, led
by Disruptive AI. The company, with total lifetime funding of $21.6
million, has plans to expand its coverage to help capture the up and
coming trends in new markets including Canada, Germany, France,
Australia and India.

"If you do a really large survey, you'll usually be talking to like 200
people. We observe 10 million consumers every single moment, and what we
basically allow you to see actually is way more statistically
significant and meaningful in real time.”

Co-founder and CEO, Tastewise

Chen said the data that Tastewise can provide is much more significant
and useful to food companies than traditional information. Historically,
food companies relied on point-of-sale data — which takes some time to
compile and only can record what a consumer buys, but provides no
information about the decision-making process or the reasons behind a
purchase. And consumer polls — another traditional source of information
— are full of inaccuracies, Chen said. Consumers are not always truthful
about the products they are looking for and why, or what they are hoping
for in the future.

“We basically look at behavior and we analyze that,” Chen said. “And we
look at a much higher scale. In a survey, if you do a really large
survey, you'll usually be talking to like 200 people. We observe 10
million consumers every single moment, and what we basically allow you
to see actually is way more statistically significant and meaningful in
real time.”

Pandemic proven

In general, the COVID-19 pandemic was good for the food business. CPG
manufacturers reaped the benefits as restaurants, offices and schools
closed their doors and consumers returned to cooking and eating at home.

But it was especially good for Tastewise, Chen said.

“There'd been so much change with what consumers want, right?” Chen
said. “That was never changing so fast until COVID.”

Tastewise was able to prove just how valuable its insights were as the
world — and consumer behavior — literally changed overnight. For
example, Chen said, before the pandemic shut everything down, there was
huge emphasis on sustainability through making reforms to food packaging
and related items, like disposable plastic straws. Quickly though,
consumers became more interested in personal safety, so more packaging —
like individual snack bags — was in demand, and concern about straws was
forgotten.

Most changes in consumer sentiment and behavior are not so quick and
dramatic, but what people want from their products is ever-changing,
Chen said. A lot of this is because of the pace of modern digital media.
All it takes for an idea to catch fire is a handful of the right kind of
influencer videos or well-timed tweets.

“If you don't understand the consumer, and you start developing a
product, and then you don't check if your hypotheses or assumptions are
still valid 12 months later, you'll be launching a product that is not
necessary,” Chen said. “And that's what we do. We basically help you
monitor the consumer needs and demand to be able to launch with
confidence.”

Because Tastewise looks for data in all kinds of social interactions
online, Chen said that the information it collects is uniquely useful to
companies. For example, he said, Tastewise can figure out what people
are doing with the food items they buy at the store, since about 70% of
items purchased are actually to be used as ingredients in another dish,
he said. If point-of-sale data shows someone buying taco seasoning and
tomatoes, it doesn’t indicate how those ingredients are being used.
Tastewise can not only determine if they’re being used together, but can
use data to show if they’re being combined for a taco bar or taco bowls,
according to the company.

And, Chen said, the level of detail in Tastewise’s insights can really
explain the trend and how it is coming together. They could pick up
something unique, like rainbow-colored baked goods. But then, Tastewise
can go a step further to determine who is making these bright breads.
Are there lots of photos from a couple of small bakeries, or are some
larger ones and influential restaurants making them too? Where are they,
geographically? All of this information, Chen said, comes together to
make what he called Tastewise’s “explainable AI” — which tells the
manufacturer the whole story of the trend so it can trust the data and
make decisions with confidence.

The future is not about “health”

One of the most remarkable things Chen is seeing now is a rapid decline
in consumers’ interest in “health.” Not healthy eating, but general
interest in “health” as a term, he said.

“All the more granular, sophisticated needs are actually rising,” Chen
said. “So people will not say, ‘Oh, I’m eating something healthy.’ They
will say, ‘Oh, this is great for my immunity system.’ ‘This is great for
my gut and it's impacting my brain.’ Or ‘This is great for energy.’”

Chen said that this new degree of sophistication on the part of
consumers is good news for food companies. It provides evidence of the
different functional roles consumers want in their food, and can help
manufacturers of both products and ingredients develop offerings that
are targeted to those needs.

“If you don't understand the consumer, and you start developing a
product, and then you don't check if your hypotheses or assumptions are
still valid 12 months later, you'll be launching a product that is not
necessary. And that's what we do. We basically help you monitor the
consumer needs and demand to be able to launch with confidence.”

Co-founder and CEO, Tastewise

Watching the trends, the popularity of individual functional ingredients
is somewhat volatile — agave and ashwagandha are hot right now, but that
could change, Chen said. The specific functions consumers want in their
food, what he called their “deep human motivations,” have been more of a
sticky trend.

As Tastewise expands to more countries and is able to find and process
more data, Chen said he sees these specific food functionalities
continuing to be central to tomorrow’s trends. And while the threat
posed by COVID-19 infection subsides and consumers are returning to some
of their pre-2020 patterns, sustainability concerns are coming back into
the fore. But Chen said these two aspects aren’t necessarily the most
important things for food companies to consider going forward.

“The biggest message that I have is that there's so many new
opportunities, and the biggest opportunity is to actually create
products that consumers actually need,” Chen said. “This is where we’re
trying to bridge the gap with technology.”

New Delhi: The success rate of startups in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world and there were 84,012 recognised startups in
the country at the end of November, Union minister Piyush Goyal told Lok
Sabha on Wednesday. “Startups are prone to failures is a very high
probability. Though I must say, the success rate of startups in India is
relatively higher than the rest of the world...,” the minister said,
adding that the number of recognised startups has increased from 452 in
2016 to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022. Goyal's detailed response to
queries on India's start-up ecosystem, however, led to some sharp
exchanges between the opposition and treasury benches, especially after
Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's objected to Goyal's “political statement”
instead of pithy responses to members' questions.

Startups brace for the worst amid lockdown

MINT

May 20, 2020 Wednesday

Length: 636 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, May 20 -- Indian startups are bracing for the biggest
shakeout in the country's history as the coronavirus pandemic has shut
down entire sectors of the economy, drying up revenues and funding.

Startups that set out to disrupt entire industries are themselves
getting disrupted. Many have quickly pivoted to slashing costs and
conserving cash from their mantra of "moving fast and breaking things".

Even before covid-19 struck, internet startups were facing a downturn
but the pandemic has demolished any hope that they would manage a soft
landing. After years of heavy spending and failure to turn profitable,
many startups are now unable to secure capital to survive a prolonged
crisis.

"Consumption has been severely impacted, thus resulting in falling
revenues and declining consumer base. This is resulting in massive
layoffs and salary cuts even at the bigger startups," said Apoorv Ranjan
Sharma, co-founder of Venture Catalysts and managing director of
9Unicorns Accelerator Fund.

The crisis, unprecedented in recent history, will lead to large numbers
of startup failures, as deprived of capital, ill-conceived business
models will collapse, investors said. A spike in mergers and
acquisitions is expected over the coming year, driven largely by
investor attempts to cut losses and save face.

Over the past two months, more than 250 startups have already shut shop,
according to researcher Tracxn Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which calls the
list "Deadpool". This number may rise sharply in the coming months. More
than 14,000 startups shut shop since Tracxn started tracking them in
2016.

While smaller startups are certainly facing the brunt of the lockdown,
even unicorns are unlikely to remain unscathed.

In the past week, Swiggy and Zomato announced major job cuts, even after
raising over $100 million each earlier this year. Sriharsha Majety,
co-founder and CEO, Swiggy, told staff that while it raised capital just
before covid hit and has sufficient runway, "it is incredibly important
to prepare for worse scenarios".

The pandemic has posed the biggest challenge for the ecosystem, with
about 90% of firms reporting a decline in revenues, 30-40% temporarily
halting operations or are in the process of closing down, and 70% having
a cash runway of under three months, a survey by industry body Nasscom
showed.

It has affected early-stage and mid-stage startups the most, the survey
said, with those in edtech, fintech and health tech reporting a
significant boost to their businesses since the lockdown started.

"Investors will start looking at how founders handled the crisis, and
how they handled issues like delayed payments and furloughs.whether they
have been transparent and how they have communicated with employees and
business partners," said Vinod Murali, managing partner, Alteria
Capital, a venture debt investor whose portfolio includes Vogo, Faasos,
Generico and Dunzo.

Out of 1,000 startups with short runways, some 200 will not get any
funding, and 30-50 startups may end up raising venture debt, Murali
said.

"Post covid is much like post World War II, it will change user attitude
and the industry. Over the next 12 months, we anticipate the
conversation around fund-raise will focus on contribution margin made
from goods sold and revenues made, not merely top-line growth," said
Suchi Mukherjee, founder, Limeroad, an e-commerce apparel firm.

Investors said they are rejecting requests for follow-on funding from
portfolio companies. "We've had to go back on our word... We've
apologised but we don't have an option. It's a matter of survival even
for us," said a partner at an early-stage fund.

Is 2008 back to haunt 2023? Lessons from SVB, Credit Suisse failures for
India; The focus of SVB on startups led to a concentration of risk, with
many clients being interconnected, facilitating a run on the bank rather
too quickly.

The focus of SVB on startups led to a concentration of risk, with many
clients being interconnected, facilitating a run on the bank rather too
quickly.

The tremors from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank
in the United States have reverberated across the financial world,
particularly in the startup and venture capital space. It is not the
first time we have borne witness to such a catastrophic event; the
memories of the 2008 financial crisis still linger in our collective
consciousness. The collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing fallout
had far-reaching implications not only for the United States but for the
global economy as a whole.

As we cast our gaze towards the present-day and the unfortunate fall of
Silicon Valley Bank, we must reckon with the potential impact on
economies around the world, including India.

Is it 2008 again?

The years 2005 to 2008 saw a massive rise in subprime mortgage lending
fuelled by loose lending standards, low-interest rates, and a housing
market that appeared to be perpetually rising. As more and more people
took out subprime mortgages to buy homes, the value of those homes
continued to rise, creating a housing bubble. However, when interest
rates began to rise and housing prices began to fall, many subprime
borrowers were unable to make their mortgage payments, leading to a wave
of foreclosures and a sharp decline in housing prices, causing
significant losses for banks and other financial institutions.

Also read:

However, the fall of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is a case of asset
liability management (ALM) mismatch concerns that turned into solvency
issues for the bank. Deposits at the bank grew more than triple from the
end of 2019 to March 2022, reaching $198 billion, while deployment
opportunities for funds were limited due to Covid. As a result, deposits
were channelled towards investments in two types of instruments:
shorter-duration investments classified as available for sale (AFS) and
longer-duration instruments classified as held to maturity (HTM).

The bank had invested heavily in HTM bonds, typically held until
maturity and not subject to market fluctuations in value. However, as
interest rates began to rise, the value of these bonds dropped, creating
a loss on a mark-to-market basis. This was a particular challenge for
the bank, as depositors began demanding their money back, creating a run
on the bank.

Despite the HTM bonds being held until maturity, the bank was forced to
liquidate them prematurely at a loss to meet depositors' demands. This
further eroded the bank's financial position and ultimately led to its
collapse.

From VC's Favourite to Bankruptcy

Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was a major player in the startup world,
providing financial services specifically tailored to the needs of
early-stage tech companies. Its deep understanding of the startup
ecosystem and focus on venture capital made it an essential part of the
Silicon Valley economy, with a major presence not only in California but
also in tech communities across the world.

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) emphasizes the advantages and
disadvantages of having a narrow focus on a particular industry. While
SVB's focus on venture capital and startups increased its risk and was a
major factor in its collapse, it also provided significant benefits to
specialization that allowed SVB to become a dominant player for
startups. By offering customized products and services, including
venture debt lending and wealth management for entrepreneurs, SVB gained
insights into investing trends and provided credit and other services to
startups.

However, SVB's single-sector concentration increased its idiosyncratic
risk, which was compounded by the hyperconnected nature of its clients.
This made it possible for a run on the bank to occur too rapidly.

It's not just SVB - Credit Suisse finds itself in deep troubles

Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest bank by assets, has been
facing a series of troubles in recent years. The bank, has been burned
by its connections to the collapses of now-bankrupt Greensill Capital
and Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management. The bank has also
undergone multiple changes of CEOs in short durations.

The recent events have only added to the bank's woes. Credit Suisse's
largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, has said that it's not
considering adding to its investment due to regulatory rules, raising
concerns about the bank's ability to make money and its potential need
to tap shareholders for funds.

The comments have amplified concerns about the bank's ability to weather
market crises and have led to a surge in credit-default swaps, as
investors rush to protect themselves against a possible Credit Suisse
default. The bank's shares plunged by 24% on last Wednesday - its
largest one-day drop in recorded history, and prices on its bonds fell
to distressed levels. Following these troubles, in a historic move, UBS,
the largest Swiss banking group is now set to buy Credit Suisse for USD
3.3 Bn to put an end to the crisis.

Lessons to Learn and Impact on India

The high-interest rate environment is like a strong wind blowing through
a forest. The trees that are weak or diseased will start to sway and
eventually fall over.

In both cases central banks intervened to prevent the contagion from
spreading, this creates a moral hazard by sending a message to investors
that they will not face the full consequences of their risky behaviour,
potentially leading to even riskier behaviour in the future. This also
results in a transfer of losses from shareholders and bondholders
ultimately to taxpayers, which has even deeper negative economic and
social implications.

SVB's focus on startups made it a crucial player in the Silicon Valley
ecosystem, and its failure could potentially affect the funding
landscape for Indian startups that rely on the bank's venture debt
lending and other services. This could result in a funding gap for
Indian startups, and in turn, affect innovation and growth in the
startup ecosystem.

The failures of SVB and Credit Suisse serve as a reminder of the
importance of regulatory oversight and the need for banks to diversify
their portfolios to reduce idiosyncratic risks. Policymakers in India
and around the world must prioritize measures to ensure the health of
the banking system, including conducting regular stress tests, promoting
diversification of loan portfolios, and implementing capital
requirements.

It is very important to strike a balance between preventing economic
collapse and ensuring accountability and efficiency in the banking
sector through measures such as promoting competition and responsible
risk-taking. Failure to do so could lead to another 2008-like crisis.

7 Things I've Learned After Being Fired

Youth Ki Awaaz

June 15, 2019 Saturday

India, June 15 -- I want to share a personal experience with everyone.

In today's era, the world is running at a rate of knots. Out of nowhere,
I found a rather crazy topic to write about. The topic here, ladies and
gentlemen, is "layoff". Well, I believe many of you must have gone
through a break-up, a serious one too, but do you know what hurts more?
A layoff. Yes, you heard that right.

Layoffs can be tough. They are like a nightmare, a delusional dream that
is pretty much real. I have experienced this nightmare a couple of
times, and I am well aware of the struggle and pain one goes through
after being fired.

Here are a few tips and experiences that I have noted down:

1. Keep Calm

No matter how much you think, this is very much real, and you have to
face it. So, just calm down and accept it.

2. Do not hesitate to ask

You have been an employee of the organisation, and you have the right to
ask as to WHY are you being laid off? It can be related to contract
termination, under-performing, etc.

3. Plan your finances.

In India, you have to take care of your finances if you are laid off.
Your salary would be put on hold. So, it's time to put your savings to
use.

4. Start looking for a new job

Use search tools, use contacts, search on Linkedin, etc. Update your
resume and start sending it to recruiters. Sitting at home won't do any
good. You need to get your act together. Motivate yourself.

5. Do not let your morale down.

I have seen many people who start losing hope when they sit at home.
redundancy in life is not always meaningless. Getting fired does not
mean that you are a failure. Pump yourself up and start finding a new
job.

first job

6. Interpersonal and email etiquette

Keep your application CVs and emails short and crisp. Do not email a
story which is about you and how sad you are. Your email should focus on
your work experience. While giving an interview, do not start with, "I
am xxx and I have studied in xxxx and xxxx. Frankly, no one has the time
to listen to Homer's Odyssey. A recruiter wants to know about your work
experience. That is pretty much about it.

7. Smile

Smile even if there is an apocalypse. This will have a positive impact
on the recruiter. All you need to do is smile and answer the questions
confidently

Lastly, be thankful that you are reading this post. Several people take
draconian measures when they lose their jobs. Do not be one of them.

All the best!

(/2018/12/failure-sibling-success-can-tap-failure-strategic-resource/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=backlink)).

John Danner is a management consultant with extensive experience in
industry and government and teaches at UC Berkeley and Princeton. Mark
Coopersmith has worked in the startup and corporate sectors and is a
Senior Fellow at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.

The core of the book is a seven-stage framework on how to harness
failure, called the Failure Value Cycle: respect, rehearse, recognise,
react, reflect, rebound, and remember.

The authors join us in a chat on how failure lessons can be taught and
interpreted, examples of leaders who share failure stories, cultural
attitudes towards failure, and tips for startup founders on negotiating
failure experiences and bouncing back to success.

Edited excerpts of the interview below:

YourStory: What is your current field of research in entrepreneurship
and the role of failure?

John Danner & Mark Coopersmith: Between the two of us, both individually
and also for programmes we run together, every year we address, teach,
coach, mentor, invest in, and advise thousands of entrepreneurs and
corporate executives. Almost all of them are seeking more innovation and
growth for their ventures, which range from startups to global
enterprises.

Some of the frameworks and tools are generally effective across the
entire spectrum, while others are more specific to size and stage of
growth. Taken as a whole, much of our work seeks to identify and
categorise common patterns of success, and failure, in each of these
arenas.

As members of the professional faculty at UC Berkeley, most of our work
is based on practical applications and circumstances in the market,
rather than traditional academic research.

YS: How big a role do academics play in entrepreneurship? Can
entrepreneurship really be formally taught as you do in your courses, or
is it something intrinsic in humans?

JD & MC: Yes, it can be taught - but in our experience how it is taught
can be as important as what is taught. Our work cuts across the
academic, startup, corporate innovation, investment, board, and other
realms. Even in our classes at UC Berkeley and Princeton, we employ
real-world case studies, simulations, and activities to bring the
Darwinian nature of Silicon Valley and most markets into the classroom.

We firmly believe that entrepreneurship is not a topic that can be
effectively taught by readings and case studies alone. For the insights,
frameworks, processes, and tools to fundamentally "stick," this is a
topic that must be experienced at a deeper level, first-hand. Or, as we
say it, with a "heads in, hands on, feet first" attitude.

In our most effective and immersive curriculum, our students form
startup teams, develop a new venture concept, investigate it in depth in
a target market, and undertake the real-world steps necessary to
comprehensively develop the opportunity and advance it to the next
stages. In fact, coming out of our classrooms and these types of
programs, we have launched more than 50 successful ventures from our
"workshop for startups" curriculum, and related courses.

One of the most important elements of understanding entrepreneurship is
developing a better understanding and skillset in how to manage risk
from the perspectives of both entrepreneurs and investors. This concept
of "derisking" plays a key role in our classroom activities and
real-world assignments.

The more effectively an aspiring entrepreneur can understand how to
derisk a venture (or pre-emptively "fail" before the market definitively
fails them), the more successful they will be in deploying capital and
other resources, and advancing their proposed venture. It is through
approaches and methodologies such as this that we can help create better
entrepreneurs in the programs that we run.

YS: How was your book received? What were some of the unusual responses
and reactions you got?

JD & MC: This is a tale of two stages. Before publication, it was tough.
One of the early responses we received from some of the publishers was
"why would we want to write a book about failure?" Essentially we failed
to communicate why failure was such an important topic. Some publishers
felt the topic was so depressing, that they quickly passed on the
concept.

Fortunately, a number of others, including John Wiley & Sons - which
ultimately published The Other "F" Word as one of their lead business
titles - were sufficiently intrigued by and interested in our research,
interviews and case studies, 7-step Failure Value Cycle, and
recommendations, that we received multiple offers to publish our book.

Once our book came out, however, we've been delighted by the response.
It became an Amazon bestseller, and we have been doing speeches,
advising clients and working with students on this topic ever since.
We're grateful for the broader acceptance of this important topic and
pleased by our early role and voice in helping bring this about.

YS: In the time since your book was published, what are some notable new
examples you have come across of failure learnings?

JD & MC: Learning from failure has become much more popular and the
stigma of addressing this topic has largely been removed, as many recent
books and articles attest. Also, many global leaders are now much more
open in sharing their failure stories, and lessons learned. Notable
examples include Jack Ma of Alibaba and Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who are
candid and outspoken about the importance of understanding this topic.

YS: Most of the case studies in your book feature startups and
companies - what are your findings with regard to failure in governments
and non-profit organisations?

JD & MC: We did not have time to delve into either arena in any depth.
John has worked in both settings as well as business and has spoken
often on innovation and failure with various government audiences.
Suffice to say we see similar taboos about failure there, with
exacerbating factors like frequent election cycles, insufficient
funding, murky priorities and often the glare of media attention.

YS: How should startup founders go about formalising their failure value
cycle in the early stages? They seem to be too busy with other
challenges!

JD & MC: One of our basic suggestions is for founders and their teams to
engage in discussion and have a broader awareness of how failure may
insinuate itself across the startup venture and lifecycle, including a
number of specific activities when founders and their teams need to pay
particular attention. Something as simple as posting a copy of the
Failure Value Cycle in the office may help attune everyone to this
reality.

Also, it's important for founders and other business leaders to talk
about some of their own failures, what they have learned from those in
the past, and how they have put that knowledge to work. This brings the
topic out of the closet into the open and allows others to engage
productively with it. In our book, we share how Chris Michel, a very
successful serial entrepreneur, does this effectively,

Since startups are primarily a real-time experiment in seeking to
discover product-market fit and a business model that works when
startups encounter failures in these experiments they need to carefully
look for insights that can lead to a better set of outcomes the next
time around. When running these real-time experiments, startups are
essentially putting forth a hypothesis, which is either proven or, in
the case of failures, disproven which also provide valuable data points
to develop new sets of hypotheses and experiments that may have positive
results.

Startup entrepreneurs also need to ensure that when they do encounter
failures, they do so early enough that the failures are not potentially
lethal. Embracing regular feedback from the marketplace is just one of
the effective early indicators.

All these elements are part of becoming a more failure-savvy leader.
There are many examples of this in our book, including how Instagram
emerged from a much broader and more ambitious failed venture called
Burbn.

YS: How should innovators strike that delicate balance between 'stick to
your vision' and 'adapt to a changed world'?

JD & MC: You have to straddle both sides of this street, i.e.,
continually assess what the right balance is between focus and
flexibility. Too much focus and you run the risk for falling (and
staying) too much in live with your own product, strategy and business
model while customers and technology have moved elsewhere.

Too much adapting and you can end up in a "perpetual pivot" that
confuses both your customers and employees as you hop from one strategy
to another. The key is creating a team and culture that can have this
debate frequently and be willing to course correct as appropriate.

YS: Is there such a thing as the 'ideal age' for an entrepreneur, or can
the creativity bug strike you at any time?

JD & MC: No age has a monopoly on either creativity or entrepreneurship.
There are successful examples in almost every decade from teens to
octogenarians. The important thing is to just get started whenever and
however the spirit moves you.

YS: It's one thing to fail with a product, and a bigger dimension to
fail with a company. How should founders regroup in these two
situations?

JD & MC: In both settings, resilience is the order of the day. There's a
phrase we like, called "graceful failure." It means planning and
designing products and projects with an eye towards recoverable failure,
so a team and organisation can learn what needs to be learned before
their resources run out.

Acknowledgement and transparency come first. People need time to
"grieve" when failure happens, given the frustration, exhaustion and
embarrassment that too frequently accompanies failure in business. So
commiseration is a great first response, far better than denial or the
"blame and shame" response of some organisations.

Finally, occasionally a genuine apology is called for. People survive
product and business failures all the time, and can be the wiser because
of it. And customers, employees and even investors often forgive
business failures. So entrepreneurs need to have the honesty - and
humility - to own up to failures along the way, learn from them and be
willing to get back in the game.

YS: What are your findings with respect to acceptance of failure in
societies outside of the US, for example, Europe and Asia?

JD & MC: We can offer only anecdotal observations here, but our
experience in working with executives and students on and from every
continent strongly suggests that fear of failure and, of course, failure
itself is a global reality. While the US and Silicon Valley are often
held out as exemplars of "second chance" societies, neither has a
monopoly on wisdom in doing what our book is all about - turning failure
from regret to a strategically valuable resource.

Every culture obviously has its own peculiarities that need to be
recognised and respected. But we have found that many of our suggestions
have been put to work by non-American readers.

YS: How would frameworks of frugal innovation and lean startup connect
with your 7 Stages framework?

JD & MC: They are both complementary to our Failure Value Cycle. Frugal
innovation itself has a built-in failure savviness to it, in that it's
about optimising a product's usefulness by ingeniously using fewer
resources. That, in turn, means that a frugal entrepreneur can afford
more experiment-learn-apply cycles of discovery without exhausting his
or her resource "runway."

Lean Startup doesn't focus as much on frugality in design and innovation
per se. It's more about the business startup experience. But its spirit
and processes are kindred spirits to both jugaad and our framework.

Our work is not limited to either startups or innovation. It is intended
for, and has been used by, both startup entrepreneurs and executives in
very large established enterprises.

YS: What is your next book going to be about?

JD & MC: John wrote a more recent Wall Street Journal bestseller with
his Princeton colleague, Chris Kuenne. Called Built for Growth, it
focuses on the personality characteristics of highly successful entre-
and intrapreneurs. It is a lead title with Harvard Business Review.

We're not yet sure whether we will do another book soon, but continually
discuss and debate several book-worthy topics. Stay tuned!

YS: What is your parting message to the startups and aspiring
entrepreneurs in our audience?

JD & MC: Think about your startup as an ongoing series of real-time
experiments. Keep putting forth a variety of options and hypotheses and
iterating until you find a solution that the market embraces.

Don't process your failures as "game over," but rather as part of a
rigorous startup methodology wherein you gather more information at each
step along the way helping you arrive at a more insightful, inspired,
sustainable, and ultimately successful set of outcomes.

PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc assessed that the socio-economic performance in
September and the first nine months was extremely comprehensive
especially the 6.98% nine-month GDP growth rate since 2011.

PM Phuc made the evaluation at the ongoing Governments regular meeting
on October 1, in Ha Noi.

The Government chief highlighted the successful hosting of the 2018
World Economic Forum on ASEAN in Ha Noi which was regarded as the most
successful regional meeting in 27 years.

The leader also mentioned the debut of the Committee for State Capital
Management (on September 30) which is in charge of managing capital in
19 State corporations and groups which have together had a total value
of assets of over VND 1 quadrillion.

The outcomes in September and the first nine months were extremely
comprehensive. Therefore, eight targets set by the National Assembly
will be met.

GDP indicator picked up 6.98%, setting a record high in nine months
since 2011. In addition, three sectors, namely agriculture, industry,
construction, service made high growth. Especially, processing and
manufacturing grew 12.65%, serving as the major impetus for overall
growth.

The macro-economy was stable. Inflation was put under control. Average
CPI in January-September increased 3.57%. Export turnover was estimated
at US$ 179 billion, up 15.4% in which the domestic sector expanded 17.5%
and the FDI sector up 14.6%. Up to 26 items joined the US$ 1 billion
export club. Five items earned over US$ 10 billion export turnovers.
Viet Nam ran a trade surplus of US$ 5.39 billion.

Viet Nam led the world in a recent survey on startup in which 92% of
respondents said that they would consider startup; 88% of others
accepted business startup failure risks.

Other fields including culture, society, environment, national defense,
security, and diplomacy were positive.

However, the Government chief asked ministers propose solutions to
specific issues especially the U.S.-China trade war.

He tasked his inferiors to keep a close watch on CPI growth rates. In
September, CPI saw a month-on-month surge of 0.59% due to increasing
education fees (up 5.7%) and rising petrol prices. Inflation pressure
remained high.

Agro-exports encountered a string of difficulties. Inventory rate of the
processing and manufacturing sector posted a year-on-year growth of
13.8%. A large number of businesses are struggling against obstacles.

The PM also highlighted the slow disbursement progress of construction
projects, problems of trade frauds, social security, large-scale
complaints, and infectious diseases.

PM Phuc assigned ministers to give comments on solutions to fulfilling
the preset norms for 2018.

90% of New Startups Fail; This Young Dude Has Got Notes

June 9, 2021 Wednesday

Copyright 2021 Pi All Rights Reserved

Length: 396 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, June 9 -- 90% of new startups fail. Here are tips on how you can
avoid startup failure:

Issue: Poor Time Management How to avoid: Set goals. Know what you need
and where you want to be ahead of time.

Issue: Little to no Research How to avoid: You don't need to know
everything, but know a lot about the market you want to enter and know
what customers/users want. The more you know, the better.

Issue: Quitting Easily How to avoid: Every startup has downtimes but no
matter what don't give up. Keep trying harder each time, and maybe even
put in extra hours.

Issue: No idea what customers want How to avoid: At a certain point,
you'll just be building features because you want to and not because you
think people will really use them. Make sure to put yourself inside of
users/customer views when building features.

Issue: Delayed Launch How to avoid: You'll have to launch your
startup/product sooner or later. It doesn't have to be perfect, you want
as much feedback so you can improve your product each time.

Issue: Investing in the wrong team (s) How to avoid: Once you gain
funding and/or can afford expanding your team, invest into diverse
fields that you need (@PaulYacoubian and @chris__lu) did an amazing job
of this! A balanced team will help you thrive.

Issue: Underfunding/Overfunding How to avoid: Underfunding can lead to
fatal consequences when building a product as you potentially cannot
meet the fees required to build your product out. The best option is to
wait until you have enough funding before starting.

Issue: Remember to sleep How to avoid: The early stages of your startup,
you just want to hustle as much as you can. However, you need to be
prepared daily mentally and you have to give yourself a rest/breaks.

Issue: No Passion How to avoid: You cannot be driven just by the money
you will receive by the product you're building, this can lead to
burnouts. Make sure you're building a product you are passionate about
building.

Have anything else to add? Let me know below.

Thanks for reading! I'm writing threads weekly to help you out. Don't
miss out! Follow me @heybereket Help others take their startup to the
moon: - Retweet the first tweet

Mantra To Successful Gaming Startup

Business World

July 12, 2021

Copyright 2021 Business World, distributed by Contify.com All Rights
Reserved

Length: 579 words

Byline: Naresh Naik

Body

Getting the right product is the first and foremost step in creating a
successful gaming startup

A clear plan of implementation and success path is essential for any
business, more so for gaming startups. It can help map out the specifics
of the business and discover some unknowns. A successful gaming startup
is a mix of few aspects. We will analyse some of the winning factors to
run a startup, and also the inevitable challenges.

Product-market Fit

We have seen many of the gaming startups being unsuccessful. The biggest
reason for the failure of most startups is not being able to achieve
product-market fit. For a good market fit, two methods are important for
online gaming. The first one is to create new games and evangelize them.
The products should be unique with less competition in space. For
instance - Angry Birds and Temple Run. This has challenges like high
risk of failure, high initial markets spend to get to a critical mass of
users, and unknown revenue potential.

The second one is to create games from existing games that are popular
in the offline space. There is an opportunity particularly when the
awareness for the product has already been established offline. For
instance, games like rummy, poker, and fantasy cricket. Clarity on the
revenue model is essential. The date on transactions in the offline
gaming market is well-documented and serves as a good indicator of the
online revenue potential.

Under the second category, there are few challenges like too high
competition and high churn. Since product idea is not unique, every
company has access to the same product blueprint. With so many
alternatives in the market, there will be high churn with customers
trying out different options leading to increased perpetual business
costs on marketing and retention.

Branding & Acquiring Users

Initially, to achieve critical mass, it is important to be frugal with
marketing spends. Look at the innovative ways to promote your brand.
Think of the Zoozoo campaign by Vodafone or Amul's girl Shoba. The
campaigns were cost-effective and had a strong recall. It is very
important to identify the monetisation potential of your customers and
potential market share. This will be the basis to justify advertising
costs and strategies for your business. Until you reach a critical mass
of users, it is very important to grow organically through customer
referrals.

Technology Stack

In an online business, tech is a winning factor in business funnel
efficiency and product quality. Prohibitions in Google Play make gamers
download the games from outside sources, creating loss of attribution
and an un-estimated RoI on marketing spend. A user goes through the
cycle of discovery to acquisition, engagement, retention, churn, and
then reactivation. At each stage, businesses need to engage with users
and invest in the right tools. On the product side, gaming application
is a challenging online product. Gaming has the highest ratio of user
inputs per minute. Investing in talent with skillsets, the right
technology and marketing makes investing capital efficient with the
reduction in costs of learning from failures in gaming startups. The
right investor would add value while identifying gaps. He can mentor
growth, identify risks, help in branding and networking to leverage
further fundraising.

Success or failures in the gaming industry need a balance across
product, market space, tech edge, and most of all, seasoned investors
who can weather the storm.

On The Occasion Of World Entrepreneurs' Day 2022, Wadhwani Foundation
Calls For Supporting Entrepreneurship In India

India Education Diary

August 19, 2022 Friday

Copyright 2022 www.IndiaEducationDiary.com All Rights Reserved

Dateline: India

Body

India, Aug. 19 -- Celebrated on the 21st of August every year, World
Entrepreneurs' Day recognizes innovation and global advancement of
entrepreneurship and leadership. It is well established that
high-potential entrepreneurship that drives jobs at scale is born out of
a culture of innovation and risk-taking. Entrepreneurship also breeds
job creators as against job seekers, a crucial and fundamental aspect of
India's economic growth.

Commenting on World Entrepreneurs' Day, Dr Ajay Kela, President and CEO,
Wadhwani Foundation, said, "Entrepreneurs are like Olympians; they go
through a harrowing journey, bringing glory to their teams and country
by creating wealth and jobs. On this World Entrepreneurs' Day, we salute
the entrepreneurs of the world. With digitization and globalization,
entrepreneurial ecosystems are rapidly evolving. In less than a decade,
India has become the leading nation for startups and entrepreneurs,
having crossed the mark of 100 unicorns, with 100 more expected in the
next three years. Total established and recognized startups in India
stand at ~73K today. Besides India, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore,
Indonesia, and others are creating thriving startup ecosystems. We are
living in unprecedented times for startups. Let the force be with them
to produce the jobs the world needs for its growing youth population."

The Indian startup ecosystem skyrocketed in 2021 to become the third
largest globally, with a 3x increase in total funding over 2020.
However, despite a stellar show, two challenges remain predominant in
the Indian startup space:

(1) Many unicorns in India lack a compelling revenue base and require an
infusion of cash flow for survival.

(2) The need to accelerate their digital transformation with technology
and platforms through policies and support mechanisms towards domestic
capital participation, favourable investment climate in tier 2 and tier
3 cities, incentives to set up incubators in every state, tax exemptions
in foreign direct investments, and a high focus on startup
infrastructure.

Says Sanjay Shah, Chief Operating Officer - India/SE Asia, Wadhwani
Foundation, "At Wadhwani Foundation, we strive to support entrepreneurs
as they are job creators making a significant and positive impact in
emerging economies. They are true game changers who constantly innovate
and rise by lifting others. On the occasion of World Entrepreneurs' Day,
I urge entrepreneurs to look at emerging fields like green technology
(Electric Vehicles, Wind Energy, Solar Energy, Recycling and Waste
Management etc.) because apart from the obvious benefits related to
sustainability, India has the potential to create 50 million jobs by
2070 by enabling a green economy."

India, no doubt, has a rich, vibrant ecosystem of startups, both in
terms of entrepreneurs and the best and brightest in the country wanting
to pursue entrepreneurship. However, to mitigate the startup failure
rate, Wadhwani Foundation's advice to startups, especially in the early
stages, is to spend with caution, focus on the customer and the problem
that they are striving to solve, and have clear answers to these
questions:

How does the unit economics of the solution work?

What does it take to produce the solution?

What is the customer willing to pay for that pain?

How large is the addressable market?

The YoY annual growth in the Indian startup ecosystem is projected at
12-15%. However, to consistently achieve this growth, the startup growth
needs to be concurrent with the growth of ecosystem enablers and market
catalysts like accelerators, incubators, venture capitalists, angel
investors, support groups, technology corporations and mentors.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], July 7 (ANI/Digpu): The Founder Institute
Mumbai is a pre-seed startup accelerator that helps aspiring
entrepreneurs, solo entrepreneurs, and small teams get their initial
traction and funding.

Through a highly structured process, constant feedback from local and
international mentors, and a lifetime of support, FI Alumni have raised
nearly $975M in funding and are building some of the world's
fastest-growing startups.

The institute believes great startups start with great people, and the
greatest variable in the success or failure of any startup is its
leadership. As a result, it focuses on Founders versus ideas in our
admissions process, and identify founders of the highest potential
through a collection of aptitude and personality tests that have been in
development with leading social scientists since 2008. To date, over
35,000 people have applied to our program, and our entrepreneur research
has been featured in The New York Times, CNN, and Forbes.

Reputed FI Mentor and founder of Mint.com, Aaron Patzer said, "The
Founder Institute appears to have developed an assessment that any
population, any city, university, or country could use to determine who
among them has the best shot at succeeding as an entrepreneur."

Founder Institute's accelerator program is the right choice for the
success of a startup as the program is designed for founders and teams
all throughout the pre-seed stage, including aspiring founders with a
full-time job, solo founders, teams, and founders of established
companies that are in pre-funding stage. Their proven methodology has
helped thousands of entrepreneurs to date. The institute's Critical
Support Network guides founders in their startup journey during and
beyond the accelerator program.

To help our founders get the support and feedback they need, the Founder
Institute creates an Equity Collective where all participants in a
program cohort (including Alumni) receive financial upside in the
companies formed. This Equity Collective aligns the incentives of all
program participants and mentors and establishes a critical support
network for startups to leverage while building their businesses.

Any aspiring entrepreneur or team interested in building an enduring
technology can apply to the Mumbai Virtual 2021 Founder Institute at

[Morning Quote] Steve Jobs' Wisdom: Innovate to Lead in Startups

Discovering the Impact of Steve Jobs' Insights on Startup Innovation and
Leadership

"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." - Steve Jobs

The iconic quote by Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., captures the
essence of innovation's role in the world of startups. As the backbone
of any successful business venture, innovation is the fuel that propels
a startup from obscurity to industry leader. In a fast-paced,
competitive landscape, embracing innovation is not just a choice; it's a
necessity.

Innovation begins with a mindset. Startups and their leaders must be
willing to challenge the status quo, break away from conventional
thinking, and explore new possibilities. This open-mindedness to change
and growth is crucial in fostering an environment where new ideas can
flourish. The spirit of innovation should permeate every aspect of a
startup, from product development and marketing to team collaboration
and company culture.

An innovative approach enables startups to differentiate themselves from
competitors, offering unique solutions to problems that traditional
methods fail to address. By solving challenges in novel ways, startups
can create new markets or disrupt existing ones, driving growth and
success. This adaptability is particularly vital in today's rapidly
changing world, where technological advancements and shifting consumer
behaviors can quickly make established practices obsolete.

To cultivate innovation within a startup, leaders must encourage
creativity, experimentation, and risk-taking. Building a team of diverse
talents, backgrounds, and perspectives is key to generating fresh ideas
and promoting a culture of innovation. It is equally important to
provide employees with the tools, resources, and support needed to
pursue and execute their innovative ideas.

Startups should also embrace failure as a valuable learning experience.
Failed experiments can offer insights and lessons that ultimately
contribute to the development of successful solutions. By fostering a
culture that values growth through trial and error, startups can
continuously evolve and remain agile in the face of change.

Steve Jobs' quote serves as a reminder that innovation is the
cornerstone of any successful startup. By adopting an innovative
mindset, embracing change, and fostering a culture that celebrates
creativity and growth, startups can position themselves at the forefront
of their industries and become the leaders of tomorrow.

Fintechs Fail When Not Understanding Customers

It is estimated that nearly 90% of fintech startups have failed and the
major reasons are lack of understanding what the customers specifically
wants and lack of timely funding:

The financial technology, or fintech, ecosystem has been in constant
evolution ever since its founding at the time when banks and financial
institutions decided to become digital and operate online. Fintechs are
credited with having created the concept of a cashless society, the
development of apps and platforms to run the financial transaction
systems and the transition of the world of finance to a near-borderless
operating pattern. Fintechs are also the creators of cryptocurrencies,
neobanks, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, et al, besides
powering simple, day-today chores like ordering food online or booking a
cinema ticket remotely, or even attending a school session.

Researchers have split fintech into different periods with distinct
differentiation in the market that led to changes in the way customers
perceived what a fintech should be. Accordingly, some have segmented the
evolution into Fintech 1.0 (1886-1967), when the infrastructure started
to take shape, Fintech 2.0 (1967-2008), when the analogue gave way to
the digital and the first ATM came to be operationalized, Fintech 3.0
(2008-current), when Bitcoin was designed and developed and
cryptocurrencies came into being using the blockchain technology, and
Fintech 3.5, which paved the way for revolutionary changes in consumer
behaviour and how people access the internet in the developing world.

AWESOME PRODUCTS

Fintechs are ubiquitous today. And they have created some awesome and
hitherto unimaginable products and services that made living worthy and
less bothersome. Just 2 of the innovations - blockchain and open
banking - are changing the way financial services are managed in a
manner that was never thought of. And add to these, there is AI and ML
that is reinventing core of banking.

Take for example the neobanks that give a new meaning to the very
concept of banking. In spite of all these positives, fintechs are highly
susceptible to failure. Sustaining a fintech startup is a difficult
proposition for any entrepreneur. For, there is uncertainty and constant
pressure to perform. So, why do some of the promising fintech startups
fail?

MAJOR REASONS FOR FAILURE

Many researchers have broadly ascribed the reasons mainly to (i) lack of
funds, (ii) poor quality or absence of customer service, (iii) poor
quality or wrong focus of products on offer and (iv) lack of
understanding of what a startup proposes to achieve.

There have also been reasons like lack of understanding of the users'
psychological behaviors and the market itself. Then there are erroneous
and impractical beliefs that 'if you can dream it, you can make it'. In
addition to these, there are sometimes lack of industry knowledge on the
part of the promoters, lack of understanding of the mindset of the
customers with regard to product design and development and lack of
proper sales and marketing strategy.

Research work has broadly listed the following general reasons for the
failure of fintech startups:

* Inadequate funding

* Mimicking another startup

* Thinking of cost as a factor to eliminate Competition

* Underestimating competition

* Lack of understanding of the mindset of Customers

* Disorderly innovations

* Lack of clarity on the revenue model

* Choosing a partner without due diligence

A majority of fintech startups have been found to be making errors in
diverse areas like targeting wrong customer segments, funding source and
technology infrastructure.

Not in the least, failures on the part of the fintech startups in
properly understanding and mastering the customer experiences and
backing client support services are a major contributory factor. No
matter how technologically superior the product offer is, unless
customer engagement takes place and customers are privy to the details
of the product in the right perspective, there is bound to be disaster.

TOUGH REGULATORS

For almost all fintech startups, especially those in the lending
business, regulators often play spoilsport. Recently, the Reserve Bank
of India came out with a mandate specifying who all can be in this
business. It has conveyed to fintech startups that it is barring the
practice of leading non-bank prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) - like
prepaid cards - using credit lines. This has been a virtual threat to
the existence of several fintech startups, who are exclusively in this
line of business. There are several of them in the country, like Slice,
Jupiter, Uni and KreditBee, who hold PPI licenses for long to issue
cards and then equip them with credit lines.

The central bank's directive, which does not identify any startup by
name, is widely thought to be impacting just about everyone including
buy now, pay later firms as well as entities like Amazon Pay, Paytm
Postpaid and Ola Money.

SOME FAILED VENTURES

Here are some of the top Indian fintech startups, which initially had
offered a lot of promise but faltered and collapsed.

Finomena was a fintech targeting students seeking small loans. It
provided 'EMI without cards', aiming to allow students purchase mobile
phones and other electronics on a loan. It was launched in March 2016,
raised its seed funding and then made quick strides but shut shop in
2018. It faced fierce competition from rivals and it spent cash where it
was not needed.

CardBack was a fintech platform that lets credit and debit cardholders
with multiple cards know which card provider would offer the best
rewards and points on transactions. It has raised$170,000 in 5 years.
However, it could not secure funds after 2014, and the number of
multiple cardholders in India was less than what the fintech startup had
expected. Its proposal to shift to Singapore, where the multiple credit
card culture is prevalent, also failed.

LoanMeet began its operations in 2015 to help small businesses grow
through ultra-short-term loans (tenure of 15, 20 or 30 days) for buying
inventory. Its services included B2B marketplace financing, working
capital financing, cash credit line, and channel financing in the range
of Rs 5000 to Rs 500,000 for a period of 15 days to 9 months. It had an
average lending ticket size of Rs 50,000 at around 18% interest rate.
The startup raised funding from Chinese investors but failed to secure
any funding after that.

Zebpay provided seamless mobile trading experience in cryptocurrencies
like Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum and many more with the wallet that serves
customers across the globe. It had to stop operations as the regulator
RBI issued a directive to its regulated entities to stop having a
business relationship with entities dealing with virtual currencies.

Koinex claimed it is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in India when
it was set up in August 2017. It had a user base of over 1 million and a
trading volume of over $3 billion and the successful execution of 20
million+ orders. The fintech, however, suspended its services in June
2019, mainly because of the uncertainty of the cryptocurrency trading
business in India.

CoinSecure was one of the fastest and largest online bitcoin exchange
platform in India. It faced a hack in April 2018, which led to the theft
of BTC 438 amounting to $3.3 million. The startup had no other option
but to shut down operations.

Globally too, there have been major shutdowns. 37Coins, which developed
a new Bitcoin platform and promised to provide Bitcoin transfer across
different regions, could not do so, mainly because of lack of funds to
develop the required technology.

BitPass was a US startup that provided a platform to make micropayments
online. It has raised $12 million in funding, but could not survive just
because of competition from traditional and well-established players.

CircleBack Lending of the US was a loan marketplace. It had to close
down in view of profitability issues created by an unviable business
model.

ScaleFactor in the US was a startup that automated SME bookkeeping and
payroll using AI tools, which were developed in-house. But the tool did
not find many takers and the firm had to wind up.

Birdy in the US claimed it was a simple app to track spending habits.
But the startup could not figure out a way to monetize the idea properly
and faced scaling issues, which ultimately led to its closure.

NEOBANK FAILURES

Australia had a unique neobank, Xinja. It had all the credentials to be
a flourishing digital bank, but it could not launch credit products that
attracted the discerning customers.

US-based Denizen, a neobank launched in 2018, closed its operations in
2019 after struggling to achieve the scale required to sustain
operations. Similarly, Moven, a US neobank that offered lot of promise
when launched, closed all accounts in its consumer unit due to funding
that fell through because of covid. In the UK, popular players such as
Royal Bank of Scotland's B and Monzo also faced significant pressure
moments, where B closed down just 6 months after launching owing to
sunken profits, and Monzo withdrew its US banking licence application
after regulatory discussions failed.

NEARLY 90% FAILURES

Fintech startups have been one of the most significant developments in
the technological and financial services industry. They are today
everywhere in the business realm highlighting the advantages of digital.
However, it is a fact that nearly 90% of such startups are failing on
account of reasons spelled out earlier. They render themselves to
improper market fit and to management by incompetent partners. They face
fund crunch, do not try to understand the customer needs and fail to
take appropriate and timely corrective steps in case of slides. It is
estimated that the total size of the fintech startups as of 2021 was
over $112.5 billion, and the estimate is it could reach a value of $335
billion by 2028.

MAJOR SUCCESS STORIES

In spite of this, there are success stories. There are several examples
of fintechs that thrived in spite of highly competitive market
conditions. For example, Stripe, founded in 2010, offers a SaaS payments
platform for e-commerce websites. Though all-encompassing in the scope
of its API, even today the platform is as easy to integrate with
third-party websites. Subscribers have the liberty to customize their
plans as per use.

Similar is the story of Robinhood, which today is valued at $6 billion.
Its app allows retail investors to invest without any trade commissions.
The UI is simple and lets users self-direct onto making in-app
navigational decisions.

Lufax of China is estimated to be worth $14.65 billion. A peer-to-peer
lending platform, it has now diversified operations into subsidiary
financial services. Its ability to harness big data and predictive
analytics has propelled it to do 200,000+ P2P transactions hitherto with
more than 14 million platform subscribers.

Paytm of India has a market cap of $5.32 billion and is most known for
its payment services. It has made use of its speed to act to become the
leading aggregator for all kinds of payments, P2P or business. Its
success is attributed to its identification with the common people by
offering essential services.

HOW TO BE PREPARED

Many pundits, who have studied the sector and researched on the reasons
for failure say the primary aim for any fintech startup is to strengthen
customer relationships and backing client support services. This is
irrespective of the prowess or utility value of the product or service.
Customer engagement is the first and foremost factor that impacts the
success or otherwise of a startup.

Secondly, they say the products that are developed should be marked for
ease of use with minimal design and at the same time the objective of
use is accomplished in the least amount of time.

Thirdly, innovation should be a continuous process. Banks and financial
institutions today have option to make use of technologies like AI and
ML, DLT, 5G etc and fintechs must be well versed in these breakthrough
technologies and develop innovative solutions for the end users.

Silicon Valley Bank fallout starts to spread around the world

Jpost.com (The Jerusalem Post online edition)

March 12, 2023 Sunday

The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is beginning to
spread around the world.

Startup founders in California's Bay Area are panicking about access to
money and paying employees. Fears of contagion have reached Canada,
where the bank's loan book has doubled in the past year. SVB's unit in
the UK is set to be declared insolvent, has already ceased trading and
is no longer taking new customers. On Saturday, the leaders of roughly
180 tech companies sent a letter calling on UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to
intervene.

"The loss of deposits has the potential to cripple the sector and set
the ecosystem back 20 years," they said in the letter seen by Bloomberg.
"Many businesses will be sent into involuntary liquidation overnight."

This is just the beginning. SVB had branches in China, Denmark, Germany,
India, Israel and Sweden, too. Founders are warning that the bank's
failure could wipe out startups around the world without government
intervention. SVB's joint venture in China, SPD Silicon Valley Bank Co.,
was seeking to calm local clients overnight by reminding them that
operations have been independent and stable.

"This crisis will start on Monday and so we call on you to prevent it
now," UK startup founders and chief executive officers said in the
letter to Hunt. The companies listed in the letter include Uncapped,
Apian, Pockit and Pivotal Earth.

Francisco, California, U.S. March 10, 2023. (credit: REUTERS/KRYSTAL HU)

Hunt spoke with the governor of the Bank of England about the situation
on Saturday morning, and the economic secretary to the Treasury was
holding a roundtable with affected firms later in the day, the Treasury
said.

Underscoring the challenge governments face in getting a handle of the
full extent of the fallout: The UK Treasury has begun canvassing
startups, asking how much they have on deposit, their approximate cash
burn and their access to banking facilities at SVB and beyond, two
people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified
because the information isn't public. Treasury declined to comment on
the survey.

"If there is no intervention, it could really wipe out a generation of
entrepreneurial companies."

Jack O'Meara

Founders were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the roundtable and any
information about how their deposits at the bank would be handled. Toby
Mather, CEO of education software startup Lingumi, has 85% of his
company's cash in SVB. He tried to transfer his accounts from SVB using
an iPhone app, but as of Saturday evening, he wasn't sure whether that
worked. "This is life or death for us," he said. "These things seemed so
mundane before."

Jack O'Meara, founder of the London genomics startup Ochre Bio, spent
the weekend trying, unsuccessfully, to move deposits out of SVB. "If
there is no intervention," he said, "it could really wipe out a
generation of entrepreneurial companies."

US Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., held a town hall late Friday that was
attended by more than 600 people including startup founders, tech
leaders and SVB employees. It went on for more than 2.5 hours with the
primary focus on small businesses trying to make payroll across the
nation come Monday.

Customers try to access money, with little success

SVB customers in California, many of them startup founders, stood
outside of the bank's branch on Silicon Valley's famed Sand Hill Road in
the cold and rain on Friday, knocking on the locked glass doors and
trying to get representatives of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to answer their questions.

A drones startup founder there said a withdrawal she made on Thursday
hadn't gone through and that she was concerned about making payroll for
her 12 full-time employees. She had tried calling the FDIC multiple
times, "but the number doesn't answer," she said.

York City, US, March 10, 2023. (credit: REUTERS/DAVID 'DEE' DELGADO)

Another customer remarked that he should have brought a bottle of
whiskey to pass around as they waited. In trying to get more information
from an FDIC representative, he said, "Put yourself in our shoes." The
representative apologized before closing the glass door once again.

Some in the VC and startup world are trying to come up with temporary
fixes. Uncapped, a UK financial tech startup that lends to other
startups, said it's launching an emergency funding program to help
companies meet payroll and other obligations, as well as longer-term
bridge loans to help with working capital.

Alexander Fitzgerald, founder of broadband startup Cuckoo and a former
Treasury official, noted that the finances of British startups are
already stretched due to a slowdown in venture capital funding market.
"British startups need the Treasury to step in fast," he said.

In Canada, SVB Financial Group's unit in the country reported $435
million Canadian dollars ($314 million) in secured loans last year,
double the $212 million Canadian dollars a year earlier, regulatory
filings show. Its customers include e-commerce software provider Shopify
Inc. and pharmaceutical company HLS Therapeutics Inc., according to a
previous statement by the bank.

Toronto-based advertising-tech firm AcuityAds Holdings Inc. revealed on
Saturday it had $55 million in deposits at SVB, amounting to more than
90% of its cash. The firm had halted trading of its stock Friday after a
14% slump, citing the "unfolding situation" with Silicon Valley Bank.

Why some experienced professionals thrive in a startup environment while
others fail

Startups have been the flavor for the last many years. No field has been
left untouched by the startup revolution with successful startups
popping regularly over the horizon. Working in a startup is something of
a medal that most new age professionals want to have on their CV.

But the craze for startups is not limited to young and enterprising,
even experienced professionals with secure high paying jobs are pulled
in by the glamour of startups and quit their cushy jobs to work with
startups full of energy, enthusiasm, vigour, non-hierarchical setups
that is adventurous and lets you work according to your style and
preference with no pre-set job plans.

But then why is it that many experienced and highly skilled
professionals fail to shine on crossing over to a startup while others
who have jumped on to the startup bandwagon thrive and excel in their
roles even there?

Here are the factors that determine your success or failure on joining a
startup?

* Risk-taking appetite

People who excel working with startups are mostly people with higher
risk appetite. The decision to chuck a cushy corporate job and take up
the challenging task of working in a startup is itself an indicator of
the person's risk-taking ability as nobody knows whether the startup
would survive beyond a few years and if it does survive what shape it
will take and what would its growth trajectory and focus be. If you are
someone who is not comfortable with uncertainty in life then obviously
the move to a startup is not advisable for you.

* Work Life Priorities

People have differing views and expectations from their job and so are
their work and life priorities. Joining a startup is a great decision
for a person who wants to fast track his career even at the risk of
failure, is highly ambitious, is a workaholic and would not mind working
for long hours under tremendous strain at a stretch often on holidays.
But on the other hand, if you want your life to be structured and have
interests other than work which you passionately feel about then joining
a startup might not be a good idea.

* Don't work for a startup just because you have reached a career
plateau

Many times professional who have hit a career plateau in large
organisations jump at an opportunity to work for a startup feeling that
it would give their job the necessary impetus lured by the success
stories of startups and the perks of working there. But one must
remember that the failure rate of startups is quite high and working in
a startup requires a very different set of skills to succeed.

* Attitude to constant change

It is a fact of life that some people love the status quo and some are
thrilled by rapid changes. It does not make one personality trait better
than the other but just that they are programmed to work and succeed in
different work environments. While a status quoist may find the informal
work environment in a startup quite unorganized and haphazard and thus
not to his liking the same environment may spur the other person to
perform more productively.

Ultimately it all crystalizes into ones' personal choices, likes,
dislikes and personality traits. What one must not definitely do is to
jump to a decision in haste. You should always take a long hard and
practical look at what you want to further achieve in life in respect of
personal and professional milestones and how much time and effort are
you are willing to put in to achieve those milestones.

A miracle shaped from the desert

INNOVATION NATION: CELEBRATING ISRAEL'S 70TH ANNIVERSARY The story of
survival in a hostile world

When Malcolm Turnbull welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
on his historic first visit to Australia last year, he spoke movingly of
the Jewish state as "a miraculous nation" that has "flourished despite
invasion, conflict and an almost complete lack of natural resources,
other than the determination and genius of its people".

Turnbull was right. As Israel prepares to celebrate the 70th anniversary
of its foundation, in all the narrative and incessant contest of ideas
that surrounds the country there is no better way to describe its
survival in a hostile world.

Israel's success in emerging as the Middle East's solitary functioning
democracy where the rule of law and religious freedom prevail, and as a
prosperous nation hewn from arid wasteland that is now a world leader in
global science and technological innovation, is nothing short of
miraculous.

As Turnbull emphasised, "in a region racked by war, (Israel) succeeds as
the sole liberal democracy, a world leader in every field of science and
technology, its culture of innovation the envy of the world".

After the Arabs had rejected a UN-proposed partition, Israel's founding
father David Ben-Gurion declared the birth of a new nation on May 14,
1948, and became its first prime minister.

Less than 24 hours passed before Israel found itself under attack from
Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The fledgling state won its war
of independence, but a pattern had been established. The heroic task of
nation-building would be punctuated by security crises - from the 1956
Sinai Campaign, the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War,
through conflicts in Lebanon and terror attacks within Israel to today's
Hamas-engineered turmoil.

As Colin Rubenstein, executive director of the Australia/Israel and
Jewish Affairs Council, has observed, there is continuity in the fact
that Israel today faces complex challenges, just as it did in the era of
Ben-Gurion.

Australia played an unwitting role in the path to Israel's foundation.
Last October, Turnbull travelled to Israel to mark the 100th anniversary
of the Australian Light Horse charge at Beer Sheva against a sizeable
Ottoman contingent. It was a feat of arms that helped British-led forces
go on to establish supremacy in Palestine, with profound consequences
for the future state of Israel.

Two days after the charge at Beer Sheva, on November 2, 1917, the
British issued the Balfour Declaration: "His Majesty's government view
with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the
Jewish people ... it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done
which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing
non-Jewish communities." The moment of truth had to wait until another
world war, Hitler's near-successful attempt to annihilate the Jews of
Europe, and Britain's contested mandate in Palestine.

The writer Nurit Greenger has captured the impotence and agony of a
people without a homeland - "a people brought to the brink of utter
destruction by the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany and its allies ...
we are speaking about people who were utterly voiceless and powerless to
influence a largely indifferent world to stop or even slow down the Nazi
final solution plan." The Jewish world, Greenger says, "stood hopelessly
naked before its fate". No wonder Ben-Gurion's declaration speaks to the
lives of all Israelis as well as those of the Jewish diaspora. Its
unequivocal commitment "to be a free people in our own land, the land of
Zion and Jerusalem", and never again to fall victim to the ravages of
anti-Semitic tyranny after the Holocaust, is what underpins and anchors
the Jewish state.

Yet its existence has often seemed precarious. Less than a decade after
independence, the politician-scholar Abba Eban summed up Israel's
predicament: "Surrounded by hostile armies on all its land frontiers,
subjected to savage and relentless hostility, exposed to penetration
raids and assaults by day and by night, suffering a constant toll of
life among its citizens, bombarded by threats of neighbouring
governments to accomplish its extinction by armed force ... embattled,
blockaded, besieged, Israel alone among the nations faces a battle for
its security anew with every approaching nightfall and every rising
dawn." Even so, Israelis have struggled to ensure that a siege mentality
and military imperatives do not trump democratic integrity.

It has not been easy. Changes in immigration have remade Israeli
politics and sharpened divisions. Demography, the settler movement and
ascendant religious parties have added to the pressure. As a generation
of the socialist-leaning, European-born elite passed into history,
Israel's state-managed economy was bound to be challenged. It happened
amid crisis. After near defeat in the Yom Kippur War, defence spending
rose to a remarkable 30 per cent of GDP two years later; by 1984, public
debt was almost 300 per cent of GDP and hyperinflation touched 450 per
cent.

The policy response included an austerity program, the reining in of
budget deficits, a more independent central bank, privatisation and deft
encouragement of venture capitalists.

These were among the preconditions for a more open economy blessed with
innovation (although cartels persist and high consumer prices breed
discontent).

Israel's population of 8.5 million enjoys a per capita GDP of $46,700.
Income inequality is high for a developed nation, and labour
productivity lags for the burgeoning ultra-Orthodox and Arab-Israelis.
Israel's robust trade and investment links beyond the Middle East give
the economy a measure of protection from the region's political
instability.

In 2004-13, export-led growth averaged almost 5 per cent per year. In
2014-17, however, average annual growth fell below 3 per cent. Israel's
uncertain security outlook had indeed dampened demand and investment.

From the outset, Israel has made expert use of meagre resources and
relied on ingenuity in the face of hardship and obstacles. It could not
count on abundant natural resources to fuel development; promising
natural gas fields off the coast were not discovered until 2009.

With little arable land, Israelis applied themselves to the careful
husbandry of water - including the invention of drip irrigation - and
made the desert bloom.

The fertiliser of human talent, as well, has made all the difference to
Israel. More than 700,000 Jews arrived from the former Soviet Union in
1990-97 and well over half of them were university educated, including
engineers, doctors and teachers.

The "right of return" has attracted migrants with a commitment to the
future of Israel.

They help explain Israel's fame as an innovator with more start-up
companies per capita than any other nation. Many spring to life in the
area known as Silicon Wadi near Tel Aviv (wadi is the Arab word for
valley).

Israelis have launched inventions in fields as diverse as defence,
driverless vehicles and drones, digital health, agriculture and water.
About 15 per cent of the world's venture capital investment in
cybersecurity finds its way to Israel.

There are many elements to this success - sheer chutzpah, a foundation
of military R&D, even the exposure of the young to life-and-death
challenges as soldiers.

"The experience they have in the army faces them with the need to be
innovative - you do not get a pocket book that gives you answers to
every situation. Many of the solutions are improvised and later on
became a theory or a method," Menahem Ben-Sasson, the former president
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said on a visit to Sydney last
year.

"After the army, they also know how to fail - failure, and recovery from
failure, is part of start-ups.

"They come to us at university very skilled, mature in life -already.
The ecosystem dictated by the security situation creates for us a
special type of student that you can hardly find worldwide." As a
foreign correspondent who has worked in the world's conflict zones for
almost as long as Israel has been an independent state, I have seen at
first hand the fine qualities of the nation. Time and again, in
situations of catastrophe far from home, Israelis have suddenly appeared
offering to help, armed with skills and hi-tech equipment well in
advance of any other available.

That was evident, for example, during the savagery of the Rwandan
massacres in 1994, when millions of traumatised people were in dire need
of help. It was in evidence again during the 2008 Mumbai Islamist
terrorist attack. On both occasions, Israelis, despite international
opprobrium against them, provided resources and other relief work that
would not otherwise have been available.

In Mumbai, one of the worst terrorist attacks since 9/11, they were able
to help track the terrorists in a way that would otherwise have been
impossible.

Years earlier, in 1976, I was witness to Israel's genius during the
hijacking and rescue of the Air France aircraft seized by Palestinian
terrorists and taken to Entebbe, in Uganda. The sheer courage and
innovative brilliance of the Israeli raid to successfully rescue victims
of a terrorist hijacking so far from home epitomises what the country's
achieve-ment has been all about.

Having been in Entebbe during the raid and seen the savagery of the
hijackers and Uganda's then dictator Idi Amin, I know something of the
genius behind the raid, which was led by Prime Minister Netanyahu's
brother Yoni.

In tactics and strategy, Israel has had to be better and smarter than
the rest. As Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, has
pointed out, Israel has problems that would have destroyed most other
countries. Sometimes those challenges seem unfathomable in their
defiance of rational solutions.

"I fear for the future of the nation I love," Lauder wrote in The New
York Times in March, pointing out that 13 million people live between
the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, almost half of them Palestinian.

"If current trends continue, Israel will face a stark choice: grant
Palestinians full rights and cease being a Jewish state, or rescind
their rights and cease being a democracy," he warns, pressing the
argument that the only viable path for Israel is a two-state solution to
the Palestinian problem.

At 70, Israel confronts a strategic scenario that is finely balanced.
With Barack Obama no longer in the White House and Donald Trump
unstinting in his support for Israel, the Jewish state is, in many ways,
better placed in international terms than it was. Significantly better
relations with a number of Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan
and Egypt, have also improved Israel's regional outlook.

Yet anti-Semitism has been on the march in the heart of Europe. Jews
have fled France for Israel, while partisans of UK Labour leader Jeremy
Corbyn dress up anti-Jewish bigotry as progressive politics.

Iran's Ayatollahs are unrelenting in their hatred of Israel, despite the
nuclear deal that Obama agreed with them, and the threat to the Jewish
state remains ominous. Quite recently, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei issued a new call to Muslims across the world to unite in the
destruction of Israel. Meanwhile, Tehran heightens the tensions with its
insurgency in collusion with Vladimir Putin in Syria, which could
provide new bases from which to attack Israel.

And then there is the upsurge of violence in Gaza. Hamas terrorists are
inciting impoverished Gazans into defiant protests under the banner of a
"Great March of Return" aimed at reclaiming Palestine, to coincide with
Israel's 70th anniversary.

It is a reflection of Israel's technical superiority that Hamas's old
tactic of raining down rockets on civilian population centres no longer
works: Israel's Iron Dome missile shield has effectively countered such
attacks. Other technological advances have ensured that the tunnels used
to infiltrate fighters into Israel are now quickly detected and
neutralised.

Hamas's latest tactic is aimed at goading Gazans in their thousands to
try to tear down the fence along the border with Israel, leading to
violent clashes with Israeli security forces seeking to protect the
international frontier. Hamas assails a country that could help Gazans
escape their misery and impoverishment (per capita GDP in Gaza is about
$2190).

Hopes for a separate Palestinian state are as remote as ever. Israel has
consistently been willing to negotiate peace with the Palestinians and
the creation of a Palestinian state without pre-conditions. Palestinian
obduracy after Yasser Arafat's retreat from the 1993 Oslo Accords has,
however, made agreement on the vital two-state solution impossible.

The Palestinian leadership is torn by internecine strife between the
West Bank and Gaza. Palestine Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is
obdurate in refusing to sit down and talk peace with the Israelis who,
for their part, are uncompromising on the question of settlement
building. The result is stalemate, the ever-present threat of violence
and the sacrifice of the manifold benefits that could flow from peaceful
co-existence.

"If people cannot live together decently," remarked the Israeli writer
Amos Oz, "let them live in separate cages." At 70, Israel can be proud
of a history of nation-building unparalleled in modern times. Turnbull
chose his words well when celebrating this as a "miraculous"
achievement. Yet it is still the case that Israel's security - the
freedom of its citizens to live and prosper with respected borders and
good neighbours - remains elusive, at best provisional. This is a
shameful state of affairs and one Israel's friends must work to
remedy.Still, there is always room for the rueful optimism of Abba Eban,
who said: "History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once
they have exhausted all other alternatives."

NEW DELHI, Dec. 30 -- Indian startups faced a challenging year, with
2,404 of them shuttering in 2022, more than double the 1,012 that had
shut shop in the previous year, according to data from Traxcn. About 266
startups that shut down this year were funded by venture capital, angel
investors, family offices or institutional investors. The companies had
raised close to $290 million, the data showed.

The number of startups shutting down in 2022 is also higher than in the
previous two years, indicating that it has been difficult for these
companies to stay afloat as investors become more cautious amid global
economic uncertainties. Only 2018 saw more startup failures in the past
five years, with 3,484 closures.

"Startup investments in 2021 were exuberant, with new financing records
being set in practically every industry. 2022 tempered the investor
mood, and founder expectations, resulting in the gain of the overall
ecosystem," said Manu Rikhye, a partner at Merak Ventures.

Edtech was among the hardest-hit segments in the Indian startup
ecosystem, with 25 funded startups in this sector closing their doors.
Funding for edtech companies in India plummeted to $2.4 billion in 2022,
down from $4.1 billion in the previous year, according to Tracxn. Among
notable edtech companies that wound up in 2022 were Lido Learning,
Udayy, SuperLearn, and Crejo.fun. The closure of Lido Learning, which
had raised $20 million in funding, resulted in loss of over 1,200 jobs.

existing teens, Sarah writes.

COEP startup fest: students showcase innovative ideas

Hindustan Times Pune Edition

February 24, 2019 Sunday

Dateline: PUNE

Body

PUNE, Feb. 24 -- There was a strong buzz in the air as 110 startups
displayed their products and services and students interacted with
investors and mentors at the first Startup festival organised by the
Bhau e-cell of the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) on Saturday. The
fest is a two-day event.

Navnath Yewale of Yewale Amrutatulya was the chief guest and shared his
success story.

"Before you start a venture it is very important that you plan
everything beforehand. I spent six years to plan my venture and in the
first year itself opened 100 centres all over Pune," he said.

He said he had tried 32 different businesses before the Amruttulya and
failed. "But they taught me many things. I learnt the importance of
knowing who your target audience will be. I learnt that it is vital to
have a proper business plan, to know everything about your business
before you start it. Never venture into a business half prepared."

There was plenty of sage advice at the inaugural ceremony. Ankita Shroff
co-founder of SAV Chemicals had a family business but chose not to join
it. After the failure of her first startup she learnt the importance of
market research before finally plunging into the adhesive business. BB
Ahuja, director COEP said "Our Bhau Institute is open to helping any
startup. We have investors on board who are ready to fund any promising
startup, we have mentors and a vibrant ecosystem that can benefit any
young entrepreneur."

Vijay Talele CEO Bhau said, "Every year we organise an event with
quizzes, speakers and some fun events. This year we wanted it to be
different. We wanted to bring the entire startup community and ecosystem
together.

"So we connected with our outreach partners and invited startups to
participate. Within a month we had 110 startups who signed up for the
event. And as of today we have 1,000 participants."

According to Talele, Pune has the potential to beat Bangalore as the
startup capital of India.

The Startup festival also had the support of the Maharashtra State
Innovative Society, the Pune Municipal Corporation and Startup India.

The startup stalls have been divided into five categories: tech,

healthcare and lifestyle, agro, social Impact and students. While the
tech category had the most number of stalls, (fifty)

healthcare and social impact had twenty stalls each and agro and the
student entrepreneurs had ten stalls each.

When the internet helped me make a new beginning

Last year was our biggest teacher. It taught us how hurdles of nature
can complicate our journey to success. The Covid-19 pandemic led to such
a crucial turn of events that the whole world was in dire straits.

But according to me, apart from causing distress, the pandemic also
helped different sectors evolve with the assistance of digitalisation.
The internet acted as the head honcho in this lockdown and transformed
our work cultures into something very modern and technical. I started my
lockdown journey just like others by binge-watching web shows, playing
games and getting addicted to the unproductive side of the internet.
After a month of being grounded due to the pandemic, I was casually
observing the digital patterns of markets and how new opportunities were
being created over the internet and it piqued my interest. Later, I was
in a discussion with my friend about digitalisation which was the
turning point for me, information about the worthwhile side of digital
opportunities was the constant source of motivation for me. Then, I
started learning affiliate marketing and digital marketing and got
myself certified as a digital marketer but what good does it make if we
don't implement our knowledge somewhere. Living by Garrison Wynn's
words, "knowledge is not power, implementation is power" I started
implementing my knowledge in productive means. I wrote an e-book on
affiliate marketing and tried to reach audiences with the help of
opportunities available online. Later, I had a burning desire to earn
money at a young age and become financially independent, this is when I
took a big step in my life. I had a few startups planned out and started
hustling for it. I started up with a POD store and a digital marketing
agency and the journey was beautiful. Then I got into content writing
and now I'm hustling hard to make all my dreams come true by advancing
my skills every day. A lot of people get demotivated by failures, they
think success can be achieved overnight but it's definitely not a piece
of cake. I've faced a lot of failures myself in my startups but it
helped me attain success by providing an immense amount of experience.

Watch: Can venture capital solve real estate's wicked problems?

July 28 -- Billions of venture capital dollars have flowed into real
estate to improve the experience of residents, office tenants and
landlords themselves. But where's the money for the really important
stuff? The climate crisis, the national housing shortage and other
wicked problems?

"The largest challenge is that there's no silver bullet," said Casey
Berman, co-founder of proptech-focused VC firm Camber Creek Partners.
"You can't say we're going to decrease the cost of construction by 90
percent, so people can have the American dream of being a homeowner.
There are a TON of step changes that are happening, that together are
creating this massive change."

 

In a conversation with The Real Deal's Hiten Samtani, Berman broke down
several of those step changes, including advances in how buildings can
measure and track their sustainability, which in turn leads to changes
in behavior.

He also dished on the proliferation of money in the real estate tech
space, and how it was important for startups to balance their capital
needs with the kind of growth that different types of investors expect.
The dramatic failure of construction tech startup Katerra, he said,
exemplifies a failure to navigate that balance.

"With venture capital, your expectation is hypergrowth," Berman
explained. "With a company that does modular homebuilding, it is
incredibly hard to grow at 100 percent per year when you have such a
capital-intensive business. That's not to say it isn't more efficient or
doesn't use fewer resources. The challenge that we see is matching the
right type of capital with the step changes that are happening to make
the world a better place to get rid of the wicked problems we have."

Failure is the sibling of success: how you can tap failure as a
strategic resource

As the year comes to a close, this outstanding book shows you seven
approaches to frame and harness past failure as a source of resilience.

You have a lot to gain when you embrace failure as a means to generate
learning, growth, and innovation, as explained in the insightful book,
The Other "F" Word: How Smart Leaders, Teams and Entrepreneurs Put
Failure to Work by John Danner and Mark Coopersmith.

John Danner is a management consultant with extensive experience in
industry and government, and teaches at UC Berkeley and Princeton. Mark
Coopersmith has worked in the startup and corporate sectors, and is a
Senior Fellow at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.

The core of the book is a seven-stage framework on how to harness
failure, called the Failure Value Cycle:respect, rehearse, recognise,
react, reflect, rebound, and remember. The 19 chapters are spread across
258 pages and are written in conversational style, with plenty of
references, tools, examples and even humour. The online companion offers
resources such as the Failure Value Report Card.

I have summarised some of my key takeaways below; see also my reviews of
the six related books Adapt,The Up Side of Down,The Wisdom of
Failure,Fail Better,Fail Fast,andFailing to Succeed.

I. Foundations: dealing with failure

The authors define failure as "mistakes and unwelcome outcomes that
matter". This includes intentional experiments as well as unpredictable
external events. Some are caused by error and carelessness, others are
the result of experiments and exploration, while still others are caused
by accidents. They vary in terms of frequency, impact, and
predictability.

Failure is personal and emotional, and can cause pain, fear, shame,
guilt, depression, isolation, and embarrassment. In many organisations,
the response to failure is denial, retaliation, scapegoating and a blame
game; for some employees, it can even lead to job loss, denied
promotion, damaged reputation, and stigmatisation. "Its memory lingers
and deepens our fear of failure going forward," the authors explain.

Many organisations penalise, ignore, rationalise or cover up failure.
Failure is also referred to variously as defeat, collapse, mistake,
loss, misstep, blind alley, bungle, flop, fiasco, mess, disaster, or
screw-up.

But the authors argue that failure can actually be harnessed as a source
of strategic advantage by startups, SMEs and corporates, provided
leaders adopt the right perspective and create the right kind of
culture. It is important to realistically confront failure and manager
it rationally.

"Although no one likes to fail, truly successful leaders know how to
turn a bad experience from a regret into a resource. They put failure to
work, driving innovation, strengthening genuine collaboration, and
accelerating growth in their organisations," the authors begin.

"You can use the inherent power of failure to inform, teach, and inspire
your organisation to lift its own level of performance," they urge.
Failure has subjective and objective connotations, depending on aims,
standards, expectations, and frames of reference.

Some failures are losses while others are acceptable defeats. The
definitions of failure can vary within the organisation, so it helps to
begin by checking how you and your colleagues define failure, cite
examples of past failure, and what lessons have been learned from them.

Though failure is everywhere, it is treated like a taboo. Failure is
like gravity, the authors explain: it is ubiquitous, pervasive and even
inevitable. It occurs across the board in products, ad campaigns,
startups, investments, M&As, recruitment, sales, transactions, and
projects.

"We not only live with failure, we live in it everyday," the authors
observe. Hence, dealing with failure begins with respecting it, just as
we must respect gravity even as we learn to fly. Failure has also been
likened to a vaccine that gives temporary discomfort before long-term
success. Failure-savvy leaders condition themselves to be optimistic in
the face of failure.

"Fear of failure is failure's force multiplier," the authors add. Fear
of failure in the near term can lead to larger and even catastrophic
failure in the long term. "Fear of failure greatly compromises an
organisation's ability to inspire, retain, reward, recognise, and
replace great talent," the authors caution.

Fear of failure in the face of the unknown stifles creativity,
curiosity, initiative, aspirations, confidence, and the innovation
spirit. Fear is failure's strongest ally, the authors warn.

At the same time, the authors caution that one should not tolerate
failure as an excuse for incompetence, negligence, carelessness,
indifference or laziness. Fearlessness about failure should not be seen
as a ticket for recklessness.

"How you deal with failures in your team is the acid test of whether you
trust them, and vice versa," the authors explain. Trust leads to better
employee engagement, willingness to give critical feedback, ability to
experiment, and capability to reflect on and rebound from failure along
the way.

"In many ways, failure creates the ultimate proving ground for trust,"
the authors add. This depends on how the organisation treats failure
personally, professionally and collegially.

"Failure is today's lesson for tomorrow," the authors affirm repeatedly.
Though understanding failure can be uncomfortable and unfamiliar
terrain, it is a fascinating frontier. "Welcome to the family of the
fallible," they joke.

Failure isn't the opposite of success, but its companion, sibling, and
complement. Failure helps ground vision with reality, according to
Google Ventures' Joe Kraus. "Entrepreneurs who don't have any fear of
failure are dreamers," he cautions; they usually do not succeed.

II. Failure in startups, SMEs, and corporates

The authors explain how failure appears in different organisational
phases and how they can be framed and managed (see my summary in Table 1
below). Each stage of growth has different connotations and consequences
of failure, and leaders should prepare themselves appropriately in each
context.

Startups by nature are fragile, and have a high rate of failure due to
their experimental state. Startups spot opportunities in markets driven
by tech trends or by spotting failures and gaps in the offerings of
incumbent corporates.

There are many examples of failed forerunners and winning successors,
such as Friendster and Facebook, and Altavista and Google. Yahoo
outpaced AOL but was then passed by Google. Apple employees left to
create Nest, which was then bought by Google.

The story of Instagram shows the power of a founding team to listen and
learn from customer feedback; they focused only on the photo feature of
the app Burbn, and the rest is history. Early e-tailers like Pets.com,
eToys and WebVan closed down; timing, context and business models have
changed, and Amazon is succeeding in many of their domains.

Unfortunately, many startups repeat the mistakes of premature scaling,
dysfunctional chemistry, lack of capital, inadequate product-market fit,
untested business models, and inability to cross the growth chasm.

In many countries, most businesses are SMEs, many run by families.
Challenges arise in sibling rivalries and inter-generational tensions,
but they also have the advantages of moderate risk-taking and long-term
planning horizons. They can combine benefits of scale and agility, as
compared to startups and corporates.

Many corporates began as confident innovators, but later become
stumbling followers and even flameouts, as seen in the case of Sony,
Atari and Wang Labs. The authors liken corporates to the "aircraft
carriers of the business naval fleet."

Though they can exploit global supply and distribution chains for
economies of scale, corporates also have more to lose from disruption.
They can thus become averse to risk and experimentation, unless they
build the capacity for innovation and trust.

It takes commitment to create an ambidextrous culture of innovation as
well as standardisation, instead of complacency, conformity, mediocrity
and incrementalism, the authors explain. Large firms may be too big to
pivot, but they can "arc" in a few years.

"Innovation is messy and unpredictable," they add, showing how Hyatt
Hotels had to push through change while introducing integrated rather
than serial coordination for preparing guest rooms.

III. The Failure Value Cycle

The most useful part of the book is the authors' framework called the
Failure Value Cycle, consisting of seven stages for framing and managing
failure (see my summary in Table 2 below). For each stage, the authors
show examples of companies that succeeded in tapping the contribution of
failure, and those that did not learn from failure.

(Stage 1) Respect failure: acknowledge its gravity

Many companies do not talk about failure internally, or in their annual
reports. They prefer to "measure what they treasure," rather than list
failures and measure what they learnt from the failures. Ignoring,
denying or defying failure is pointless.

Instead, leaders should set the tone by sharing their own stories of
vulnerabilities, even with a touch of humour. Conversations should
centre on What did you fail at today? to unearth insights to new
approaches, as explained by Spanx founder Sara Blakeley. Language,
comfort and candour in such conversations go a long way in boosting
confidence in dealing with failure.

"Problems that need solving" (UAW) and "issues and challenges" (Avon)
are better terms to describe failures. The field of science uses the
frame of experiments and hypothesis testing to assess outcomes. Terms
used in other industries are post-mortems (medicine), failure analysis
(engineering), and rapid prototyping (design).

There should be a clear demarcation between no-failure zones and
no-fault failure zones. Six Sigma works well in routinised domains, Zero
Stigma works better in experimental domains. Failure should be
de-personalised, the authors add.

Though Kodak had internal champions in digital photography and
conductive films, it could not see past its original business model. On
the other hand, Indiegogo openly shares what is not working, and asks
employees for suggestions for solutions. Avon has a "Raise your hand"
culture to encourage employees to flag issues.

(Stage 2) Rehearse: an ounce of anticipation is worth a pound of
improvisation

The authors distinguish between two types of organisations:
high-reliability (eg. airlines, hospitals) and high-resilience (eg.
sports teams, startups, jazz bands). They call for rehearsals,
checklists, redundancies on the one hand, and adaptability, flexibility,
and simulations on the other.

Protection of "crown jewels" is a priority (eg. IP, algorithms, design,
internal processes). Contingency plans need to be drawn up in case each
of them is compromised. Scenarios of different kinds of challenges need
to be enacted and even competed upon ("pre-hearsals").

"Avoid the hearse, take rehearsals seriously," the authors joke. In the
words of Intel's Andy Grove, "only the paranoid survive." Organisations
should chart out "failure horizons" that include black swan events.

For example, Twitter has extensive discussions on the successes and
failures of its projects, and documents them for future reuse. UCSF
Medical Centre conducts frequent rehearsals of emergencies.

(Stage 3) Recognise: pick up signals early

When failure is a constant companion, companies should devise
early-warning alert systems about product defects, new trends, emerging
startups, and changes in customer expectations, competitor offerings and
regulations. Companies should "listen for the running water" like a
beaver does, and repair existing dams or build new ones. Instead of
focusing only on the status quo or static quo, leaders should address
the future quo, the authors joke.

Unfortunately, many examples have shown otherwise: Target ignored early
warnings about data security breaches, and GM ignored early signs of
ignition problems. Many incumbents failed to see or change to new
business models, as seen in the case of Kodak, Polaroid, Wang,
Blackberry, and Borders.

(Stage 4) React: deal with failure

This stage unfolds quickly, and responses will depend on the scale,
scope and type of failure. Companies should classify the types of
scenarios, as seen in meteorology (hurricane categories), architects
(buildings for different Richter scale earthquakes), and firefighters
(number of alarms). Resist the knee-jerk reaction to scapegoat, be
visible and available, acknowledge and apologise as relevant, and honour
your honest failures, the authors advise.

Examples of good recovery include Johnson & Johnson (handling of the
Tylenol tampering case in 1982) and Morgan Stanely (evacuation procedure
during 9/11 attacks). Those who flunked at this stage include BP (Gulf
of Mexico oil spill) and Lulemon Athletica (yoga gear complaints).

During the Apollo missions, NASA's culture had a healthy respect for
failure, and continuously rehearsed and reflected on its experiments.
This culture unfortunately changed later, with people being ostracised
for identifying risks, thus leading to the Columbia and Challenger
shuttle disasters.

Interestingly, the authors point out that the phrase "Failure is not an
option" was a Hollywood scriptwriter's fiction from the movie Apollo 13,
and was apparently not uttered by mission director Gene Kranz.

(Stage 5) Reflect: turn failure from a regret to a resource

It is tempting and sometimes easy to resort to finger-pointing, blaming
and shaming in the aftermath of failure. While there should be high
accountability, those who tried hard and failed despite their efforts
should also be honoured, according to Severin Schwan, CEO, Roche.

Elizabeth Kubler-Ross describes five stages of grief: denial, anger,
bargaining, depression, and acceptance. This framework can be adapted to
organisational failure as well. Mere acceptance of failure leads to
incompetence and mediocrity; instead, there should be insightful
reflection and corrective plans. Recovery and reflection go together.

The authors recommend different steps to handle ripple effects of
failure in four groups: insiders (console and thank those directly
involved), outsiders (admit and atone to customers and partners),
audience (explain and reaffirm to media and investors), and colleagues
(send the right signals, for example, don't fire or abandon employees).

The authors cite Google and Ontraport as examples of companies that do
not penalise failures or find fault with people, but instead focus on
what went wrong rather than who did it. Open Innovation helps get
outside inputs in ideation, as in the case of Boehringer Ingelheim
(crowdsourcing algorithms in drug development via Kaggle). Asking others
for help should not be seen as an admission of failure, but a quest for
more creative solutions.

(Stage 6) Rebound: retake the initiative

The authors identify five responses to failed initiatives: tenacity
(rivet rather than pivot), tweak (minor adjustment), turn (abrupt
change), turnabout (fundamental reversal), or pull the plug. At this
stage, failure lessons have been absorbed and incorporated in the next
stage.

For example, Netflix initially bungled the launch and pricing of its
parallel Qwikster service for DVD rentals. It apologised to customers,
revised pricing, repositioned itself, and cancelled Qwikster to focus
only on streaming. Such a comeback can take months or years, the authors
explain.

(Stage 7) Remember: embed failure-savvy in your corporate culture

"The worst failure is repeating one you've already made," the authors
warn. Resilience, competence and confidence of a company in the face of
failure need to be reflected in the way it embeds failure lessons in its
DNA.

Failure and recovery stories are a rite of passage for startups. Such
stories should be personal and authentic. Stories, and not just formal
metrics, are a powerful force to shape a more failure-savvy culture,
according to BCG's CEO Rich Lesser and partner Roselinde Torres.

Failed products can even have talismanic value. The past should be
honoured so as to create a lasting legacy across generations. The
solvent WD-40 stands for "Water Displacement, 40th formula" - reflecting
the past 39 failures. Ford's Model T was named as the successor after
earlier Models B, C and so on down the line. Rovio celebrates how it
made 51 attempts before finding success with Angry Birds.

Bessemer Venture Partners publishes an "anti-portfolio" on its website,
of companies that it passed up but went on to become successful: such as
Intel, FedEx, Google, PayPal, and eBay. This admission was even done
with a touch of humour, and takes guts and humility, according to the
authors.

Walmart has a practice called "Correction of Errors," which focuses on
problems and solutions. Dental drug firm Henry Schein's recovery from a
painful computerisation rollout error in 1988 became a lasting story
testifying its resilience, grit and organisation-wide commitment.

Intel made key rings of its flawed Pentium chip for its employees, with
the inscription: "Bad companies are destroyed by crises, good companies
survive them, great companies are improved by them."

The Googleplex campus is built on the headquarters of former heavyweight
Silicon Graphics, and has a replica of the T-Rex dinosaur as a reminder
that once-mighty kings can become extinct as well.

IV. The Road Ahead

The book ends with description of a Failure Value Report Card that
leaders can use to chart their journey to becoming more failure-savvy by
tracking progress across the above seven stages. It has questions about
conversations around failure, classification of failure types,
environmental scans, core values, rehearsed protocols, internal
communication, and failure lessons.

Graders should be drawn from the leadership team, as well as others
inside and outside the organisation. There should be provision for
anonymous feedback as well. General statements should be backed by
specific examples where possible.

Corporate values of trust, teamwork, loyalty, creativity, and confidence
are forged in the crucible of failure, the authors sum up. This is
evinced at leader, manager and team levels. An innovative and ambitious
company should be prepared to deal with the discomfort of failure, which
is a natural step in venturing out of the comfort zone.

A fallible but failure-savvy organisation is marked by honesty (in
discussing failure), curiosity (to forge ahead despite failure), pride
(in overcoming failure), humility (in poking fun at one's own failures),
and engagement (no fear of ridicule in the face of failure).

"Failure is one strategic resource you and your team create every day.
It has the power to teach you what to do and not to do next," the
authors sign off.

Why Indian startups need to change the way they bank

The Economic Times

Section: STARTUPS

Length: 614 words

Body

By Harshil MathurToday, India is home to the third-largest startup
ecosystem (9,300 tech startups) and an abode to the third-highest number
of unicorns (companies with a valuation over $1 billion). So there's no
doubt that India is an epitome of innovation, thanks to startups
building solutions aimed at solving locally relevant issues. But in this
era of unicorns, soonicorns and IPOs, while it's easier to get caught up
in the stories of startup successes, startup failures are becoming more
common.Albeit other reasons for this failure - 'no market' need or the
lack of alignment among founders and investors, the biggest and most
tragic reason for some promising businesses to fail within the first
year or two is primarily because of not knowing how they can best manage
their financial challenges.I have sailed the same ship and witnessed
other entrepreneurs who did their due diligence, created reasonable
financial projections and yet struggled to pay for unforeseen expenses.
In the early stages of a business, even a relatively small expense that
is not accounted for in the company's budget can make it difficult to
pay bills or make payroll.It's important for businesses to not only
think beyond just sourcing working capital for operational and
day-to-day expenses but also adopt a new-age banking solution that will
help the business with entire money management within the organisation,
in addition to borrowing working capital.And, if you ask, why I can't do
all of these with my existing bank, ask yourself how many business hours
has your team spent on manual labour, dealing with buggy software and
complex infra systems?

The most important factor for Indian businesses is to have issues
resolved at the first point of contact, and to receive the same level of
experience and service, over and over again.A 'one-size-fits-all'
traditional banking solution doesn't suit the business banking needs of
new-age businesses. Therefore, the lack of an intelligent tech
infrastructure has led to the birth of neo-banks. These exist to
simplify banking for businesses, accelerate and supercharge every aspect
of a business's financial operations - from accepting payments and
managing cash flow to reconciling transactions and flexible payouts. In
its nascent stage, neo-banks are taking over the fintech industry. Let's
understand this difference better.Access to daily financial reports and
diligent insights is a norm for startups and SMEs. Unfortunately, this
can take some time with traditional banks. Neo-banking is made for
today's DIY generation where everything is accessible at the customers'
fingertips. Businesses can generate reports based on specifications on
their neo-banking dashboard, without banks' interventionWhile
traditional banks have restricted working hours, which means, businesses
are required to work within the set banking hours, neobanks help
businesses integrate in just a few days and enable a 24*7 money movement
facility.It's critical for businesses to have real-time visibility of
their money movements. Waiting on a traditional bank facility to provide
this information comes at the risk of losing valuable time and manpower.
Using data in the right way and at the right time to inform your
strategy is what neo-banking platforms are designed to look at.This year
will mark yet another significant progress in innovations in financial
services. How neobanks manage obstacles like regulation and compliance,
security, API integration, and how they will come together with
traditional banks to build intelligent solutions will be an interesting
watch for all of us in 2020.(The author is CEO of Razorpay) For Reprint

OPPOSITION CORNERS GOVT ON STATE OF ECONOMY

New Delhi: Former finance minister P Chidambaram posed questions to the
government in Rajya Sabha on Monday, seeking details on Chinese
incursions, constructions on the other side of the border, the extent of
area being patrolled by Indian troops now and whether these issues were
discussed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jingping on
the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali. He led the Opposition in
cornering the Modi government in the Rajya Sabha during a debate on the
state of the economy when a money bill was taken up. The issues raised
include “sluggish” growth, “favouring” corporate houses, rising
inflation, alleged fall in private investment and high unemployment.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved The Appropriation (No.5) Bill,
2022 to authorise payment of funds — `3,25,756 crore — from the
Consolidated Fund for several subsidies and other expenditure in the
current financial year.

Initiating the debate, Chidambaram made six points relating to the
economy and even raised the Chinese incursions issue towards the end of
his speech. “`500 crore have been sought in the bill for defence
expenditure. We grant that and more if necessary,” he said, posing
questions about the strategic roads in the northeast and other
infrastructure for which this fund is to be utilised. “Has China
conceded anything on Hot Springs or agreed to discuss Doklam and
Depsang? What does buffer zone mean? Are we no longer patrolling in that
area where we were earlier?” Chidambaram said. He referred to the
statement of the US State Department spokesperson that there has been a
massive infrastructure construction on the Chinese side of the
IndiaChina border. “Have roads, bridges, settlements, helipads been
built on the other side?” he said. The treasury benches protested
against Chidambaram raising this issue when the appropriation bill was
under discussion and cited ru- les to claim that he is digressing. They
became more aggressive when he sought to know if PM Modi and President
Xi took up this issue. “The prime minister was seen shaking hands with
the Chinese president at Bali. I did not see President Xi say anything.
I just want to know if the border situation was discussed — yes or no,”
he said, wondering why there is such reluctance on the part of the
government to discuss this issue. Raising issues relating to the
economy, Chidambaram asked the government to share the break-up of
inflation rate and real growth when it speaks on nominal growth figures.
He also sought to know how the government will generate `3,25,756 crore
it needs — whether it has collected this amount as revenue, or intends
to borrow this sum, or if government will get this money from the ex-
pected nominal growth of 11.1%. Chidambaram charged the government with
favouring the corporate houses. He maintained that in 2013-14, the
proportion of corporate tax in the gross tax revenue was 34%, which has
now been reduced to 26%, a fall of 8%. “Why has this huge bonanza, which
comes to `2.5 lakh crore (approx), been conferred on the corporates?” he
said. He made the point that private investment has been “slow,
sluggish” and recalled that Sitharaman had recently “mildly scolded” the
corporates for not investing enough. On the growth front, Chidambaram
said in 1991, the GDP was `25 lakh crore, in 12 years it doubled to `50
lakh crore in 2003-04, and by 2013-14, it was `98 lakh crore. “This
government has been in power for nine years. Will you be able to double
the GDP to `200 lakh crore by 2023-24?” he said, adding that he does not
wish to be a “doomsday prophet”. He also asked what the government
intends to do about falling exports, meeting the challenges posed by
major economies going into a recession. Derek O'Brien (Trinamool) posed
questions on BJP's poll promises during the 2019 polls and slammed the
government on federal governance, unemployment, 20 million women
quitting work since 2017, writing off of `10 lakh crore owed by
corporate houses and high jump in food inflation, among others. Raghav
Chadda (AAP) spoke on farmers' woes, failure of 90% startups to last
more than five years, falling rupee, as well as inflation and
unemployment. Sitharaman will reply to the debate on Tuesday.

Markets to remain on edge amid global headwinds

Indian equities are expected to trade with a negative bias and remain
volatile in the next few months given the sticky inflation in the US,
anticipation of more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve,
geopolitical tensions and the collapse of a bank in the US.

"Volatility will continue as the interest rates in the US are expected
to peak beyond 5.5%. The yields are inching up in the US and investors
will be happy to get a risk-free return of 4-6% than invest in a country
where the currency is depreciating 4-6% every year. The Russia-Ukraine
war remains a cause for concern as well," said UR Bhat, director,
Alphaniti Fintech.

Indian equity markets posted negative returns for the third month in a
row in February. In the past three months, the Nifty 50 is down 5.8%
while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 are down 5.1% and
6.4%, respectively. The benchmark Nifty is still below the 18,000 levels
it hit in October 2021. Mid and smallcaps tend to underperform in a
high-interest rate environment, which is likely to persist for some more
time.

The US treasury yields breached the 4% levels a few days ago, but have
retreated since then over fears of contagion in the financial sector
following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and robust February
employment data.

"Monetary tightening expectations in the US have ratcheted up again
following Jerome Powell's Congressional testimony on Tuesday, with the
terminal rate now put at 5.64%," said Christopher Wood, global head of
equity strategy at Jefferies.

The usual lags in the impact of monetary policy will be greater than in
the past because the credit boom in this cycle has been in the private
lending market, the dynamics of which are much less understood by
central bankers, said Wood. "This will create a bigger risk of an even
more pronounced bull trap market rally than normal as investors become
convinced that the downturn can be avoided," he said.

The collapse of SVB last week may prevent the Fed from opting for an
aggressive 50 bps rate hike this month and settle for 25 bps instead.
Market pundits are still weighing the consequences of the bank's
collapse given its presence in other geographies such as China, India
and Israel. Fears on the bank's failure potentially wiping out startups
around the world without government intervention are gaining ground.

"As rates go higher, there are likely to be unintended consequences. The
recent bank collapse in the US may lead people to wonder if there are
other problems lurking out there which can impact the global financial
markets," said Andrew Holland, CEO, Avendus Capital Public Markets
Alternate Strategies.

"It is unlikely to be a Lehman moment but global leaders need to work
together to contain the contagion," added Bhat.

India's valuation remains stretched relative to its emerging market
peers, and rotation of FPI flows to other markets may lead to some
consolidation in the near term, said experts. "We are still expensive
and earnings upgrades are less likely, especially in the first half.
Unless the Fed went on hold, there is no catalyst for the markets at the
moment," said Holland.

FPIs have net sold shares worth $2.5 billion in the year to date. Flows
are likely to get a boost in the second half as earnings growth starts
to pick up and funds specialising in emerging markets allocate more to
India, said experts.

The Nifty is trading at about 18x FY24E EPS. There is room for modest
upside if corporate earnings do not see material downgrades ahead,
according to experts. Corporate earnings for the third quarter were
below expectations led by weak demand environment and macro headwinds.

"The Street expectations for earnings growth in the March quarter are
not too high. Banks, which account for a large chunk of the benchmark,
are expected to do well, along with metals and oil & gas," said Bhat.

The short-term trend of the Nifty continues to be weak. "Having formed
an unfilled downside gap and a formation of positive candle pattern of
Friday indicates possibility of minor upside bounce for the market,
which is likely to be a sell-on-rise opportunity for next week.
Immediate resistance is around 17,600 levels and the next lower supports
to be watched at 17,250," said Nagaraj Shetti, technical research
analyst, HDFC Securities.

Entrepreneurs from across the sectors agreed on a similar definition and
explained that innovation should be focussed on and according to the
customers' demands, needs and expectations

Given the times of uncertainty, the new-generation entrepreneurs are
working on innovative solutions across the segments and the disruptors
are becoming the trend-setters, catering to the evolving and encouraging
environment.

In terms of failure in startups, all speakers agreed that it is part of
the whole startup culture and most important what appeals to you.
Rejection is definitely there but it is all about how you recover from
it.

Aman Singh, Co-founder and Head of Analytics, Intangles said how not to
be person-centred disruption, but the team who makes the decision, the
team takes responsibility, but also as a founder I may have a bigger
responsibility.

Singh said innovation comes from sitting with innovative engineers and
gazing at the problems and ideas. Over the years, reading has also
helped in innovating and keep summarising. Research and development is
the way of life for tech startups. R&D should work with the needs of
customers, not in silos.

Anvi Lohia, founder of Ampana Life defined work ethics, she said ethics,
in general, has become centric. The company is more responsible for the
work culture.

Anshita Mehrotra, Founder & CEO, Curls And More Llp, said that targeting
a particular section is always a disruptor. It's about more than a
founder, disruption is carried by the team.

Arnav Kishore, CEO & Founder, Fire-Boltt, innovation is not something
new or out of the box. It is probably which works for you, how you
present it, and how you sell it. We keep looking for new ideas on a
daily basis.

Kishore added that it took a lot of time to build the hardware and put
health and Artificial Intelligence (AI) together. For the first five
years, but after the pandemic, people understand how it is important. In
2020, the overall market size was 4 million units but now it is
anticipated it will cross 33 million units.

On the other side, Mehrotra said that Innovation should be according to
the customer, what your customer wants and focus on the customer and on
a particular set of people.

At the awards ceremony where 30 startups were recognised whose founders'
age is under 30, on Thursday. Discussions on different themes followed
the award ceremony. The first discussion was based on Disruption As A
Culture: The Upward Curve, hosted by Senior Editor, BW Businessworld.

These 3 least discussed startup mistakes founders fail to recognise

The emergence of the startup ecosystem has been seeing two sides of the
world - one of success, and another of failures all over the world,
including in India.

Tonnes have been written and discussed on various mistakes that lead to
startup failures, including a bad idea, going alone, no or improper
planning, lack of focus, mediocre leadership, spending money recklessly,
launching at the wrong time, etc.

However, the scope of this discussion touches upon certain mistakes that
are not discussed or written about as they deserve related to the Indian
startup ecosystem.

The advent of technology and initiatives like 'Make in India' has led to
the sharp rise of Indian startups. In fact, this has been strengthened
by continuous support from the government and improvement in the Ease of
Doing Business Index.

Moreover, Startup India has established an ecosystem to encourage
entrepreneurship and job creation for the country.

However, despite all these factors, it is estimated that 90 percent of
Indian startups fail within five years of their inception as per a
report by IBM Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics.

The reasons for their failure can be one or a combination of reasons
such as the type of industry or business, the region or the market
target for business, the skills, attributes, and track record of
founders, among others.

These mistakes are least discussed, but not of least importance. These
are some of the areas where the least discussed startup mistakes happen.

The originality of ideas

An idea makes or breaks the startup. Bad ideas are quickly vetted and
easily avoided by intelligent founders and brilliant investors. A good
idea before its time can be a deadly trap sucking resource of pioneers
and wasting time fertilising the ground for settlers to come in later to
flourish.

While enough has been discussed about the above element, what is being
pointed out here is a different reason related to the idea. We have come
across several startup enthusiasts who don't want to put in efforts but
copy or clone other successful business ideas or business models.

Such startups have all the inherent ingredients to fail miserably unless
it has some USP or differentiator, which provides an extra value that
other players in a similar business don't possess.

For an idea to succeed, it must be original, authentic, and credible.
Only then, the founders who conceived it will be able to smell, breathe,
and sleep the passion for the idea.

Before one starts working on the business plan, the idea has to be
thought of, deliberated, and researched well, considering the
feasibility of success with more focus on the pros in detail specific to
the business plan instead of assuming it would be the same as the
original.

A founder's passion

It is well discussed that the founders who have in-depth knowledge of
the business, its underlying technologies, passion for success, and an
overall understanding of various pillars of business fare well in their
business and attract investors.

However, this is about their attitude. Many founders think that dropouts
make it big in business because people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs
did it.

These dreamers contribute more to the failure rate. For them, a startup
is an excuse not to complete their formal academic studies and instead
venture into something with a patched-up business idea, hoping that
after few months, investors will queue up to fund their business and can
strike gold easily.

Needless to say that such founders lack skills, leadership qualities,
domain knowledge or experience, and these reasons are enough for a
guaranteed failure.

This is not to sound pessimistic, but to alert those who have dreams to
become an entrepreneur about the pitfalls lying ahead in accomplishing
their dream.

The importance of support functions

The idea is the hero, but the founders assuming once they have finalised
a solid viable idea, they can do everything under the sun by themselves
are committing a costly mistake of misjudgement. Thus, a good idea can
fail too if it is not implemented thoughtfully.

Often, early-stage startup founders neglect functions like finance,
accounting, HR, IT, etc., either by trying to do all these functions
themselves or outsource them to mediocre service providers. These
back-office or support functions are normally looked down upon as
non-value adding or unproductive function.

These days, alternative options are available for part-time or freelance
services of any function during the initial stages. However, there is a
tendency from startups to avoid availing of good services for functions
like finance and HR as long as possible, assuming it would save money in
the early stages.

The startup funding will not help unless money is managed diligently and
judicially, which calls for sufficient skills and experience to manage
cash flow and investment. Add to it the need for legal, statutory, and
tax requirements, which if not complied in time, can land the startups
in an unenviable situation, resulting in losing governmental benefits
and incentives.

Most of the times, founders get their business plan and valuation done
by consultants, who provide unrealistic excel sheet plans. Most of the
times, these plans are theoretical workings and projections based on
unrealistic assumptions extrapolated using templates and copying the
plans of other startups.

It is a prerequisite that people with business and finance acumen must
work closely with the founders to understand the pulse of the idea and
work on putting up a realistic plan.

Those days are gone when you could mesmerise investors with glossy
looking business plans without substance and proper research. At the end
of the day, a business plan must be achievable and intelligent to
investors.

In fact, the internal IT function is very crucial in setting up internal
technology needs, tools, and systems to facilitate a smooth working
environment. This has gained more importance during the COVID-19
pandemic, where facilitating robust work from home environment is very
crucial.

Needless to reiterate the importance of sourcing and onboarding
resources who are skilled and motivated, and more importantly, are a
cultural fit for the startup.

Neglect them at your peril

Even if the founders have decided to onboard resources or outsource the
functions, the founder must have a fundamental understanding of these
functions, or if there are multiple founders or co-founders, they should
assume leadership responsibilities of the function they are comfortable
with.

They should know the basics of taxation and other compliances, finance
tools like cash flow management, valuation to the minimum, resource
planning, onboarding processes, and technology tools if they want to
steer their business to success.

There are two main reasons for sidetracking these functions - one, the
founders' overconfidence in taking care of all these functions by
themselves, and another, the urge to save money or reduce cost, which is
good unless the result is more costly than what is saved.

7 Things One Should Know Before Joining A Startup

Body

With small businesses responsible for nearly half of all private-sector
employment, it is inevitable that a startup will eventually be part of
your interview process. The startup India and digital India programs
soaring high in the Indian economy explains the growth of entrepreneurs
as well as the making of a skilled workforce. Working for a startup can
be an exciting, inspiring experience, allowing you to get into the real
business world and enhance your learning on the ground floor of what
could be the next big thing.

USP/Value Proposition

The individual should look at the products or service offerings of the
firm and its unique service proposition. The candidate should also
consider the kind of value that the company can add to their customers.
The candidates are also advised to check whether the offering can solve
any of the burning issue/ current challenges in the market. The offering
must bring innovation and provide superior technological benefits. The
service or product offered by the company should also satisfy value for
money and should be reliable for the targeted clientele. In short, the
USPs of a Startup should be completely satisfactory for their discerning
customers and should look at the challenges from a different angle.
Today is the time to sail against the winds and startups must find
innovative approaches to address the needs of their clients. There is no
sense of working for a startup where the candidate cannot challenge his
own capabilities and utilize His true potential to the fullest.

Promoter credentials, their Track record, Management Team, and Investors

The track record and credentials of the promoter and Management team
should be carefully evaluated. An entrepreneur with leadership skills is
the quintessential part of a startup, and the complete management team
with all the qualities of a perfect leadership is also important. This
is one of the key parameters to take a decision whether it is worthwhile
joining the firm. Understanding the fundraising strategies and the
background of the investors is very important otherwise this may have an
impact on the scalability of the offering in the long run. When the
investors are global, they would certainly bring a variety of experience
and expertise to the startup. Right from a small startup to a grown
organization, promoters' credentials and successful track record of the
management team should be considered important while joining the
company. It is said that the foundation must be strong to build a better
organization. Therefore before taking the decision of entering any of
the startups the potential candidate must check the complete hierarchy
of the management and their background.

The addressable market for the product or service, and Potential to grow

"The market size" or "the potential for the offering", plays a major
role for the startup. Scalability of the product or service is critical
to take a decision whether the firm can sustain the short term and long
term headwinds in the industry or market. Innovation is the key in the
market; hence every product or service that enters the market should
address the existing issues or should provide the needful services. In
case if a Startup fails in the field of innovation and R&D, candidates
should stay away from such organizations rather than making a hasty
decision. One needs to evaluate whether the offering is a copycat or new
innovation which is first of its kind in the market, as it means a lot
if the organization is a leader or follower in the industry. To
understand, if the offering has high entry barriers and intensive
investments, the survival of the firm can be very high compared to a low
entry barrier business.

Passion

Your passion towards the Products or the Services offering of the
company is the real decision point that you will stay with your
organization for long or part your ways sooner than decided. Right from
the invention of the bulb to the airplane, it was the passion that drove
the entrepreneur or the leader and their workforce to achieve their
goal. With the evolution of Technology and Science, there have developed
uncountable avenues of work field where a people can show their true
potential driven by their passion. Passion has always been a key factor
to succeed in anything that we do, in that way the individual should
have a clear understanding and interest in the products or services
offering of the firm. As the wise have said be with people who are
equally passionate as you and follow the leaders who can motivate you to
become even more passionate and dedicated to your work.

Societal impact, Macro or Micro Economic environment and Political
Scenario

As we see today the offerings which have a high societal impact will
last long with the customers. With the development of society and
economy, people are having higher disposable income than before, and the
requirements in daily life have also increased. The services or products
which can be part of daily essentiality of people have the maximum
probability to grow and flourish. The startup firms would get a major
boost from the policymakers and the governments where the offering has a
high impact on the society. This is advisable that one should target his
career in industrial vertical which has a greater consumer base because
that ensures the stability and future growth of the organization.

Work Culture, Ethos and Values of promoter team

Work culture, ethos & values, the way it deals with stakeholders of the
organization matters a lot when it comes to a promoter-driven company.
It is important to understand and gauge the clear intentions of the
promoters whether they are here to stay long term or to create value and
sell the firm on reaching a certain mass. This can be drawn from the
teams and people closely work with the promoter team and infer some of
the data points from the discussions. Empowerment, Freedom to take
decisions and allowing employees to take risks are a good sign of
promoter's intentions of building a highly capable team and an
organization.

One needs to look at the startup as a platform that provides an
opportunity to create wealth, long-term equity and profit sharing or not
just as another employment. The individual needs to think thoroughly
whether it's really worth jumping into a startup which has a toll on
work-life balance and financial stress. As the millennials have the
tendency to look for an accelerated growth, startup companies can pave a
way for a fast track career growth.

Financial risk

On the risk side, as there is always an uncertainty of the market growth
one should prepare themselves to face certain financial risk when
stepping into a start-up. Although Domestic and international banks
extending their services to Financially help the startups and even the
grown organizations have made it simpler for the new Ventures to enter
the market, yet the potential financial risk of failure of the startup
model or underperformance of the services/ products can hamper the
startups in long run. The evolution of BFSI (Banking, Financial
Services, and Insurance) sector has also helped the startups to
establish themselves and gain grounds. This is suggested that before
joining a Startup the candidate should analyze the financial risk sector
of the company and take the decision accordingly.

Indian Health Startup Mojocare To Scale Down Operations After Layoffs,
Financial Reporting Review

Newstex Blogs

International Business Times News

June 19, 2023 Monday 7:50 AM EST

Delivered by Newstex LLC. All Rights Reserved

Body

June 19th, 2023 ( International Business Times News — Delivered by
Newstex )

Investors at the Indian health and wellness startup Mojocare said they
will be "scaling down operations" after they found "financial
irregularities" at the company.

"Major investors of Mojocare initiated a review of the company's
financial statements. While the analysis remains ongoing, initial
findings have uncovered financial irregularities, and it has become
apparent that the business model is not sustainable due to a variety of
operational and market factors," the investors said in a joint
statement, as per Business Standard .

As a result of the findings, the company will be scaling down its
operations as the investor group works with the startup during the
transition period.

While investors did not specify the events that led to the launching of
the probe into Mojocare, Indian news outlet Morning Context reported
Sunday that the startup had been inflating its financials and engaged in
paying questionable vendor partners for some time.

The startup denied "all accusations of money being taken out of the
company."

Mojocare recently laid off between 150 and 170 employees or about 80
percent of its workforce, citing the need to "rationalize costs,"
CNBC-TV18 reported .

"Facing difficult market conditions, we at Mojocare have had to make
tough decisions to improve our unit economics," a spokesperson told the
outlet.

The startup's investors include Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia
Capital India and Southeast Asia), Better Capital, Chiratae Ventures, B
Capital and Surge among others.

In May 2022, Mojocare saw its major investors rallying to land the
company $20.6 million in a Series A funding round. At the time, the
company said the funds raised will be used for product expansion and
diversifying the product portfolio among others.

News of Mojocare's layoffs and scaling back came after several other
Sequoia-backed Asian companies have been accused of business misconduct.

Last year, car servicing startup GoMechanic was accused of financial
misreporting after Malaysian sovereign fund Khazanah Nasional and
Japan's SoftBank jointly tapped accounting firm EY to review
GoMechanic's financials.

GoMechanic co-founder Amit Bhasin has since admitted to errors in the
startup's financial reporting. The company also announced earlier this
year that it was slashing its workforce by 70%, affecting around 700
employees.

Another Sequoia-backed startup, e-commerce platform Zilingo, was accused
of "significant irregularities in reporting to investors" last year.
Investors jointly hired Kroll Inc. to review the irregularities.

Zilingo investor Burda Principal Investments (BPI), said in April that
misreporting to investors ultimately led to the Singapore fashion
startup's failure.

Ankiti Bose, Zilingo's co-founder and former CEO, vowed that she would
clear her name after she was ousted from her position. "There is not a
single payment made by Zilingo that did not have proper documents or
either the finance, tech, or operations teams were not aware of," Bose
told Bloomberg last year.

Finally, an independent audit accused fintech startup BharatPe's
co-founder Ashneer Grover and his wife Madhuri Jain of allegedly
misappropriating the company's funds.

Peak XV, which is BharatPe's largest shareholder, said it will "take
tough calls where needed in the interest of doing what is right" after
news of BharatPe's issues emerged.

Last year, Peak XV said some of its "worst days are when we hear about
breaches of integrity or ethics in the portfolio" of startups it
supports.

"Recently some portfolio founders have been under investigation for
potential fraudulent practices or poor governance. These allegations are
deeply disturbing," the venture capital firm wrote in a blog post .

The company vowed to "take a set of proactive steps" to ensure that
every startup across its investment portfolio commits to business
integrity.

Protect and preserve the present, while you navigate future, says Hero
MotoCorp CFO Niranjan Gupta

December 08 -- Mature companies need to adopt a comprehensive dynamism
where they navigate for the future while protecting and preserving the
present, said Niranjan Gupta, chief financial officer of Hero MotoCorp.
The failure rate for startups is around 70-80%, but 80% of mature
companies cannot afford to fail, so it's an additional burden on mature
companies to protect their present, he added.The additional
responsibility of a regulated company's CFO is to be accountable for
quarterly earnings and ensure the company is not left behind in the race
on the new business models, and new mobility systems, he said.Gupta
highlighted that to develop new business models, along with corporate
structure company's need to change the mindset, Hero MotoCorp has
adopted a changed mindset and has launched its new vision, which is to
be the future of mobility, and not just be confined to two-wheelers or
affordable two-wheelers.

On the burden of accountability to investors on mature companies, Gupta
said that for mature companies, since there are investors and there is a
dilemma. "Investors would want quarterly results, new business models
and also value to be created. And of course, they wouldn't like to see
cash burn," he said.According to Gupta, adopting the subsidiary route is
one method to deal with this situation. "The company can then behave
like a startup, while the parent company continues to be held
accountable for the kind of cash generation and quarterly reporting the
company needs to do," he said.

Pittsburgh's AI expertise may give rise to an already growing startup

Emerging markets tend to go in and out of vogue. First, Austin was the
next biggest thing, then Atlanta and, more recently, Miami. Pittsburgh
has yet to have its moment, but all the signs are there that it could be
next.

Having local expertise in the category every VC wants to invest in right
now doesn't hurt, either. The Steel City has all the ingredients to be a
hub for startups: a good university system, a cheaper cost of living -
definitely when compared to places like New York and the Bay Area - and
a proliferation of seed firms and startup accelerators. Plus, it has
seen a homegrown success story in language learning app Duolingo, which
went public at a nearly $4 billion valuation in 2021. Startups in the
city raised more than $534 million through December 12, 2022, according
to PitchBook, which, while not a lot of capital, is better than 2021,
when they raised $336 million. And while the data is not consistently
trending up and to the right - there was a huge outlier deal (Uber
Advanced Technologies) in 2019 that spiked the yearly investment total
to $1.3 billion - venture investors on the ground can feel the city's
potential. (I talked about Pittsburgh's startup ecosystem on the City
Cast Pittsburgh podcast recently in the context of two high-profile
startup failures there, Ford- and VW-backed Argo AI and robotic vertical
farming outfit Fifth Season. You can give it a listen here.) Ven Raju,
the president and CEO of Innovation Works, a local startup accelerator
and seed fund, said he's seen the market grow 10x in the last decade and
6x in the last three years. "The ecosystem is on a tremendous upward
trajectory," he added.

Prospering in the pandemic: winners and losers emerge from Covid chaos;
Apple and peers top the list of gainers since January 2020 while China's
Alibaba leads the failure board, Peloton joins start-ups whose early
lustre has faded and energy groups enjoy a bounce

Two years after the emergence of Covid-19, a jarring disconnect has
emerged between the human toll and the record valuations of many large
companies. Silicon Valley dominates our list of companies whose market
value grew the most in dollar terms since January 1 2020, headed by
Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft.

But non-tech groups were winners too: consultants Accenture, diagnostics
specialist Thermo Fisher and retailer Home Depot all made the top 20.

Nor is it purely a US list, with companies such as Canada's Shopify and
France's LVMH included.

Although China is represented - by battery maker CATL and spirits
producer Kweichow Moutai - many of its big companies had a rough ride in
2021, as they faced increasing regulatory pressure. Alibaba heads our
list of biggest pandemic losers, which also includes battered property
developer Evergrande.

We also highlight companies, such as Zoom Video and Peloton, that faded
after an initial rush of excitement about their prospects. Finally come
the bouncers, including energy groups such as Gazprom and banks such as
BNP Paribas, which endured sharp sell-offs but recovered strongly.

For the full list of pandemic winners, losers, faders and bouncers, see
www.ft.com.

Tom Braithwaite 1. Apple Sector: Technology / hardware HQ: Cupertino, US
Apple's stock ended 2021 close to a record, not just for the company but
for any company, ever.

Despite facing supply chain challenges and its stores closing, the
iPhone maker has hit a $3tn market value, almost triple its pandemic low
in March 2020. Employees working from home are spending less on travel
and restaurants but upgrading their iStuff. Patrick McGee in San
Francisco 2. Microsoft Sector: Software HQ: Redmond, US With the
pandemic accelerating the shift to cloud computing, Microsoft is firing
on all cylinders. Its Azure cloud platform and Office 365 tools have
been a mainstay.

But Microsoft has a finger in many digital pies, including the hiring
market (LinkedIn), business applications (Dynamics) and gaming (Xbox).
Growth is above 20 per cent for the first time in a decade. Richard
Waters in San Francisco 3. Alphabet Sector: Internet HQ: Mountain View,
US Google's parent went into the pandemic as a powerful advertising
company. It is coming out of it as one of the main engines of a booming
digital economy.

Retailers' much greater reliance on digital sales has fed its search and
YouTube advertising, while its cloud computing division is finally
justifying its billing as a third participant behind Amazon and
Microsoft. Late in the year, growth jumped to 40 per cent.

Regulators are circling. but Wall Street sees no immediate threat.
Richard Waters 4. Tesla Sector: Automotive HQ: Austin, US The electric
car pioneer became the first $1tn carmaker and made its co-founder and
chief executive the richest man.

To many, the stock price seems absurd, but even looking five years out,
it is unlikely that any of its much larger rivals will outpace Tesla in
producing electric vehicles - and those are the only vehicles investors
care about. Patrick McGee 5. Amazon Sector: Ecommerce HQ: Seattle, US
With Jeff Bezos busy blasting himself to space, chief Andy Jassy took
over in July. Since then, the costs of doing business during Covid-19
have throttled growth and profits, with billions spent on keep- ing
Amazon's reputation for fast delivery intact.

The stock underperformed compared with most big tech groups, but
analysts are optimistic. Staffing costs should drop in 2022, while the
company's emerging advertising business is shaping up as a bona fide
challenger to the Google and Facebook duopoly. Dave Lee in San Francisco
6. Nvidia Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Santa Clara, US No other chip
company has ridden the pandemic wave as well as Nvidia.

Its graphics chips have become the main workhorse behind artificial
intelligence and other data-intensive applications that are fuelling the
rise of giant cloud data centres. The high-end gaming market and a
useful sideline in selling chips to cryptominers have been a bonus.

Its next target: the metaverse, where it is building a platform for
other companies that want to reach their customers in new virtual
worlds. Richard Waters 7. Meta Platforms Sector: Internet HQ: Menlo
Park, US It has been a bruising year for Meta (formerly Facebook),
battered by accusations that its poor moderation contributed to
January's Capitol riots, whistleblower allegations that it prioritises
profits over safety and new regulatory investigations.

Nevertheless, its share price has weathered the reputational hits,
reaching a record $1tn for the first time in June. Its resilience is
testimony to the booming digital advertising market.

It is now in a headlong dash to build its version of the metaverse.
Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Hsinchu, Taiwan The largest
manufacturer of made-toorder chips has not only been boosted by a leap
in demand for electronics gadgets during the pandemic. It also expects
to keep growing faster until 2025 as 5G and AI further push the use of
semiconductors in everything from factories to cars to homes.

TSMC is boosting investment in new plants from an average 30 per cent of
revenue to more than 40 per cent. The goal is to widen the lead it has
over competitors such as Samsung and Intel. Kathrin Hille in Taipei 9.
ASML Sector: Semiconductor equipment HQ: Veldhoven, Netherlands Of the
many businesses claiming to be "the most important tech company you have
never heard of", Dutch machinemaker ASML has perhaps the best case.

A Philips spinout, it is the leading manufacturer of the enormous
lithography systems used by virtually all chip producers, including
Taiwan's TSMC.

The rush to expand semiconductor manufacturing capacity helped ASML sell
a record number of its most advanced machines this year, boosting
profits more than 60 per cent in its most recent quarter. Joe Miller in
Frankfurt 10. The Home Depot Sector: Retail HQ: Atlanta, US Consumers
have spent more time at home than usual during the pandemic, prompting
them to spruce up their living spaces with everything from a fresh coat
of paint to new backyard furniture.

The do-it-yourself frenzy has been a boon to Home Depot, the largest US
home-improvement retailer. Matthew Rocco in New York 11. UnitedHealth
Sector: Healthcare HQ: Minnetonka, us

The biggest US health insurer has benefited from an uplift in healthcare
spending and enhanced collaboration between its insurance and services
units.

It has added 2m health insurance customers since the end of 2020 and has
50m customers. Jamie Smyth in New York 12. Kweichow Moutai Sector:
Beverages HQ: Zunyi, china State-backed Kweichow Moutai, the premium
Chinese liquor maker, posted revenue growth of just 11 per cent in the
first nine months.

However, the growth figure has never been the focus for Chinese stock
pickers, who instead prize the company's 90 per cent gross profit
margins and Moutai's place on the table at almost every business meeting
and upper-class function. Ryan McMorrow in Beijing 13. LVMH Sector:
Luxury goods HQ: Paris, France When Covid arrived, investors feared that
luxury conglomerate LVMH would be hard hit given its heavy reliance on
affluent Chinese tourists taking shopping pilgrimages to Paris and
Milan.

Instead, the sector's undisputed leader has gone from strength to
strength. Analysts expect its sales to be 15 per cent higher than 2019
this year, reaching roughly (EURO)61bn. Leila Abboud in Paris 14.
Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd Sector: Batteries HQ: Ningde,
China's dominant maker of batteries for electric vehicles has boomed
thanks to growing sales to customers such as Tesla, Daimler and BMW and
the country's homegrown electric vehicle manufacturers. Ryan McMorrow
15. Broadcom Sector: Semiconductors HQ: San Jose, US Exposure to a wide
range of chip markets - particularly smartphones, broadband and wireless
networking - left Broadcom well placed for the network investment boom
that has accompanied the growing reliance on digital services.

Wall Street also grew more confident that the chip industry's most
acquisitive company would take a back seat on deals for a while, and
instead reward shareholders with higher dividends and share buybacks.
Richard Waters 16. Thermo Fisher Sector: Life sciences tools HQ:
Waltham, US The scientific equipment maker enjoyed a $7bn revenue boost
during the first three quarters of 2021 from the supply of
pandemic-related products such as Covid tests and raw materials used in
vaccines.

It also expanded through mergers and acquisitions, closing a $17.4bn
deal to acquire clinical research company PPD in December.

It upgraded its 2022 sales and earnings forecasts in October and expects
to generate $37.1bn in revenues next year, up 15 per cent on 2020. Jamie
Smyth 17. Accenture Sector: Professional services HQ: New York, US The
pandemic has forced companies to accelerate plans to operate digitally.
Accenture and other technology consultants have gained mightily from the
flurry of clients spending on digital transformations, cloud computing
and cyber security.

The consultancy reported record revenues of $50.5bn in the year to
August 31. Sales continued to rise in the three months to November 30,
new bookings hit record levels and Accenture added 50,000 people to its
workforce to meet demand. Michael O'Dwyer in London 18. Shopify Sector:
Ecommerce HQ: Ottawa, Canada Shopify had its first ever $1bn revenue
quarter in July, with the Canadian ecommerce company's chief financial
officer telling analysts that online habits formed during 2020 would
endure.

While growth slowed in 2021, analysts see the company as being in prime
position as a facilitator of "omnichannel" retail, a blend of online and
in-store shopping. Dave Lee continued on page 8

Based on 7,600 companies continued from page 7 19. Netflix Sector: Media
HQ: Los Gatos, US With people across the world staying at home during
lockdowns, Netflix added a record 36m subscribers in 2020. That pace
slowed in 2021 as some countries went back to more normal routines.

But Netflix's stock surged again this autumn thanks to a flood of fresh
content, including its biggest hit ever: Squid Game. The South Korean
drama series was viewed by 142m households across the globe, giving
investors renewed confidence that Netflix can produce a smash hit. Anna
Nicolaou in New York 1. Alibaba

Sector: Ecommerce HQ: Hangzhou, China Jack Ma's ecommerce group has been
buffeted by one challenge after another this year.

Ma went missing. Alibaba was hit with a record fine for antitrust
abuses. China authorities stepped up their campaign to dismantle its
fintech arm Ant Group after cancelling its blockbuster initial public
offering. Rivals including Pinduoduo, www.JD.com and ByteDance's Douyin
have stolen away shoppers and its cloud unit lost marquee international
customer TikTok.

As the largest Chinese company listed in New York, its future is doubly
uncertain. Ryan McMorrow 2. AT&T Sector: Telecoms HQ: Dallas, US With
the announcement that it would spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with
rival Discovery, AT&T conceded defeat on its high-stakes Hollywood
gamble.

Slashing the dividend by almost 50 per cent sent its stock sinking.
While exiting its costly media foray is welcomed by investors, the
damage will take longer to undo. AT&T's $80bn acquisition of Warner left
the company saddled in debt, restricting its ability to invest in its
core business: telecoms. Anna Nicolaou 3. Ping An Sector: Insurance HQ:
Shenzhen, China The Chinese insurance group reported its first annual
fall in net profits for more than a decade in 2020.

Despite a rebound in profits in the first quarter of this year, it
suffered from its exposure to indebted developer China Fortune Land
Development, which defaulted on $530m of dollar-denominated debt in
March. The group's share price was later affected by the crisis
surrounding real estate developer China Evergrande and fears of
contagion to the wider Chinese economy. William Langley in Hong Kong 4.
Royal Dutch Shell Sector: Oil and gas HQ: The Hague, Netherlands The
Anglo-Dutch supermajor has struggled to fully recover from a devastating
2020 when Covid restrictions crushed crude demand, sending its shares to
lows not seen since the 1990s.

Oil prices have rebounded and with them profits, dividends and buybacks.
But green headwinds have become stronger and a new strategy for the
transition is yet to convince investors.

With an activist pushing for a break-up, a Dutch court ruling to comply
with and a possible leadership transition to manage, the months ahead
will be challenging. Tom Wilson in London 5. The Boeing Company Sector:
Aerospace HQ: Chicago, US Last year Boeing was still struggling from the
fallout of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max when the pandemic crushed
customers' demand for aircraft. With governments restricting travel,
airlines slashed flying schedules, parked jets and deferred orders for
new ones.

The aerospace manufacturer has also been hampered by production problems
with the 787 Dreamliner that have prevented it from delivering the
widebody for most of the last year. Claire Bushey in Chicago 6.
Anheuser-Busch InBev Sector: Brewers HQ: Leuven, Belgium The pandemic
took the fizz out of drinks sales as lockdowns cut sharply into
high-margin revenue at bars and restaurants.

Shares in the largest brewer suffered more than Carlsberg and Heineken
after it scrapped its interim dividend two years running and reduced its
fullyear payout. Investors have been worried about the group's $83bn
debt pile dating from its 2016 acquisition of SABMiller. But
third-quarter sales surged past pre-pandemic levels and new chief
executive Michel Doukeris has pledged a renewed focus on consumers.
Judith Evans in London 7. Citigroup Sector: Banks HQ: New York, US In
her first earnings call as chief in April, Jane Fraser announced that
Citigroup was putting most of its Asia consumer business up for sale,
which investors took as a sign that it was applying a new sense of
urgency to closing its longstanding profitability gap with megabank
peers.

But progress is slower than many would like. So far, the bank has only
successfully exited three out of the 13 markets it highlighted, and has
booked more than $2bn in losses throughout the process. Imani Moise in
New York 8. Intel Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Santa Clara, US Most chip
companies have thrived as the pandemic stokes demand for all things
digital. Not Intel.

The arrival of a new chief raised hopes that the once impregnable
semiconductor company would get back to competing with TSMC at the
leading edge of advanced chip manufacturing. But with the chip
industry's long investment cycles, and with AMD eating into Intel's PC
and server markets, all investors can see ahead is heavier spending,
with no recovery yet in sight. Richard Waters 9. China Mobile

Sector: Telecoms HQ: Beijing, China US sanctions rolled out in 2020 by
Donald Trump against companies deemed to have links to the Chinese
military hit China Mobile hard.

The share price jumped in January after the New York Stock Exchange
backtracked twice on plans to delist the company to comply with the
sanctions, leading to an appeal from China Mobile and two other telecoms
companies. But they tumbled again when the appeal was rejected in May.
William Langley 10. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Sector:
Banks HQ: Beijing, China The bank, one of China's largest, had a better
year in 2021 than it did in 2020. However, the role played by state
lenders in supporting the Chinese economy in the early days of the
pandemic, followed by exposure to failing distressed debt investor
Huarong and China's property sector dragged down their share prices.

The string of difficulties took the shine off its proposed joint wealth
management company with Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which won
Chinese regulatory approval in May. William Langley 11. Itaú Sector:
Banks HQ: São Paulo, Brazil The saying goes that Brazilian banks profit
even in bad times. Itaú was never an exception. At the height of the
pandemic last year, Brazil's largest lender reported R$19bn ($3.3bn) net
profit.

But the pandemic accelerated structural changes that threaten the
longstanding dominance of traditional lenders. More and more customers
are switching to fintechs or neobanks, such as Nubank, which offer much
easier access to digital products and services. For banking analysts,
the "age of competition" has arrived in Brazil. Bryan Harris in São
Paulo 12. China Construction Bank Sector: Banks HQ: Beijing, China banks
were enlisted to help extend cheap loans to struggling businesses during
the early days of the pandemic, hitting their profits in 2020. Shares in
China Construction Bank, like many domestic rivals, were later hit by
concerns over the health of the country's banking sector after Huarong,
the country's largest distressed debt investor, delayed the release of
its financial results in April. This led to fears that Beijing would
allow a large state-backed institution to default. William Langley 13.
Banco Bradesco Sector: Banks HQ: São Paulo, Brazil Like Itaú, Banco
Bradesco's performance was solid during the height of the pandemic,
reporting R$16.5bn ($2.9bn) in net profits in 2020. But also like Itaú,
the group has a new breed of digital banks snapping at its heels.

Bradesco is considered susceptible because its tech has often lagged
behind that of its main competitors. Rising default rates and
historically low interest rates in the first half also hurt the bottom
lines of Brazilian banks. Bryan Harris 14. BP Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
London, UK Chief executive Bernard Looney, who took the helm at BP in
February 2020, has had a bruising pandemic.

First, the oil price collapsed. Then, days after outlining plans to
invest heavily in clean energy, the stock fell to a 25-year low.

Earnings rebounded this year thanks to rising commodity prices, but
exclusion from the COP26 climate summit showed that neither politicians
nor investors are quite ready to back Looney's green vision for BP's
future. Tom Wilson 15. Merck Sector: Pharma HQ: Kenilworth, US Merck
faces a growth challenge because of the loss of exclusivity on its
multibillion-dollar cancer drug Keytruda towards the end of the decade.
It also lost the race to develop a Covid jab, and its antiviral
treatment, molnupiravir, has failed to live up to its early promise.

The company is chasing mergers and acquisitions to overcome the looming
Keytruda patent cliff, and in November spent $11.5bn on Acceleron
Pharma, a biotech company that develops therapies for rare disease. More
deals are likely in 2022. Jamie Smyth 16. HSBC Sector: Banks HQ: London,
UK

HSBC executives say it is "the biggest international bank in China, as
well as the most international Chinese bank". It has not been a good
time to be either.

HSBC's shares have plunged since the start of 2020 as it has struggled
to navigate US-China geopolitical tensions, Beijing's crackdown on Hong
Kong and questions over London's future post- Brexit. Stephen Morris in
London 17. Wells Fargo Sector: Banks HQ: San Francisco, US Wells Fargo
hoped for a fresh start after years of scandals when it appointed
Charlie Scharf chief executive in late 2019, but turnround efforts took
a back seat once the pandemic hit. Now, Wells looks poised to bounce
back.

Although Scharf's strategy of cutting costs and investing in areas where
the third-largest US bank punches below its weight is hardly novel, his
blunt commentary about Wells' shortcomings gives credibility to its
comeback story. Imani Moise 18. ExxonMobil Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
Irving, US The 2020 pandemic-induced oil crash exposed huge problems at
heavily indebted ExxonMobil, the US's biggest oil company, which by the
end of the year had recorded its first annual loss and been ditched from
the Dow index.

In 2021, activist Engine No 1 defeated Exxon's management, installing
three board directors with a mission to revamp the energy transition
strategy. Its shares regained value as oil prices recovered. Derek
Brower in New York 19. Verizon Communications Sector: Telecoms HQ: New
York, US The US telecoms sector has been in a price war for several
years. In 2021, AT&T upped the ante with its "free phones for all"
campaign, offering discounts even for existing customers, forcing rival
Verizon to broaden its own offers. Anna Nicolaou 20. China Evergrande
Group Sector: Property HQ: Shenzhen, China Some companies default
suddenly. Others prefer to do it gradually.

In August, the most indebted real estate developer, China Evergrande,
warned about stalled projects. But no official confirmation came in
September, when angry retail investors descended on its headquarters and
the group failed to pay international bondholders. In December, Fitch
declared a default. Evergrande declined to comment. Thomas Hale in Hong
Kong ffaaddeerrss 1. China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Sector:
Automotive HQ: Guangzhou, China Shares in Evergrande New Energy Vehicle
Group took off at the start of 2021 after tycoons bought into a share
placement, taking its market valuation to $63bn, eclipsing that of Ford
without selling a single vehicle.

The shares have since collapsed and the company, worth just $4bn, is
being closely watched by international investors in its indebted parent
who believe they may have recourse to it as part of a restructuring
process. Thomas Hale 2. Alibaba Health Information Technology Sector:
Healthcare HQ: Hong Kong The fortunes of Alibaba's healthcare arm have
slid alongside those of its parent, as founder Jack Ma, found himself in
political trouble and Chinese authorities ramped up their scrutiny of
Alibaba's businesses. Ryan McMorrow 3. Peloton Sector: Leisure products
HQ: New York, US Peloton's IPO a few months before the pandemic was
perfectly timed for investors: once the world locked down, home fitness
boomed.

The company's value soared from $8bn to almost $50bn before the
narrative cycled off-track in 2021, and the brand became the butt of
jokes on the

Sex and the City reboot. Patrick McGee 4. Pinduoduo Sector: Ecommerce
HQ: Shanghai, China The China ecommerce group traded blistering growth
for profitability this year, but rather than reinvesting those earnings
or passing them to shareholders, it is donating much of the money to
charity to get in the party's good books. Ryan McMorrow 5. Bilibili
Sector: Interactive home entertainment HQ: Shanghai, China Bilibili
became a darling as users swarmed into its online world of video games,
anime, livestreams and videos. But the party's tech crackdown has taken
some of the wind out of its sails.

Underage gamers, for instance, have had their online time cut to just
three hours a week. Ryan McMorrow 6. Zoom Video Sector: Application
software HQ: San Jose, US The company that became synonymous with
working from home during the pandemic is facing a tougher second act.

Its once-stratospheric growth is projected to fall below 20 per cent
next year as the flow of new customers ebbs and many of the small
businesses that signed up during the crisis abandon the service. Wall
Street still hopes Zoom will break into new markets such as voice
calling. Richard Waters 7. Pinterest Sector: Internet HQ: San Francisco,
US The site reported bumper revenues but struggled to pin down new users
as the world began to reopen and competition rose from deep-pocketed
rivals such as ffaders

Meta and TikTok. Hannah Murphy 1. ConocoPhillips Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
Houston, US The biggest independent oil producer in the US hunkered down
and idled production as the crude price crash of 2020 ravaged the
industry.

Then prices surged and Conoco moved to take advantage, snapping up rival
Concho Resources and Shell's shale assets to build a commanding position
in Texas and New Mexico's Permian Basin. Investors liked the new scale,
but also Conoco's resumption of share buybacks, rising dividend and
focus on capital discipline. Derek Brower 2. Reliance Industries Sector:
Industrial conglomerate HQ: Mumbai, India Reliance chair and India's
richest man Mukesh Ambani is fond of big targets, and 2021 has been
about trying to meet them.

After raising billions from investors, the energy-to-telecoms
conglomerate's plans to launch a low-cost smartphone and take on Amazon
in ecommerce have had limited success. But Reliance's share price has
been boosted by a rebound in demand for oil products. Benjamin Parkin in
New Delhi 3. Siemens Sector: Industrials HQ: Munich, Germany Under new
management after longstanding boss Joe Kaeser dismantled the
conglomerate, a more agile Siemens has benefited from state and central
bank responses to the pandemic. Joe Miller 4. BNP Paribas Sector: Banks
HQ: Paris, France When companies cancelled dividends at the onset of the
pandemic, it caused an ugly blip for BNP Paribas, with losses on complex
derivatives products in its equities division.

But it has emerged as one of the strongest lenders of the health crisis,
and stole a march on hesitant rivals in debt underwriting. Sarah White
in Paris 5. Schlumberger Sector: Energy services HQ: Houston, US The
crude plunge of 2020 and deep capital spending cuts by oil producers
delivered a blow to the sector. Shares in Schlumberger fell more than 70
per cent as the pandemic hit. The recovery since then in oil prices and
drilling activity has boosted revenue, cash flows and share prices.
Derek Brower 6. Rosneft Sector: Oil and gas HQ: Moscow, Russia's top oil
producer had a rough time at the start of the pandemic. The subsequent
oil recovery, along with a weakening rouble, more than doubled Rosneft's
share price from its pandemic low to the end of 2021. Nastassia
Astrasheuskaya in Moscow 7. Volkswagen Sector: Automotive HQ: Wolfsburg,
Germany The second-largest carmaker has benefited from the semiconductor
shortage, which has allowed it to prioritise the production of high-end,
and more profitable, Porsche and Audi models. Soaring used-car prices
have driven profits at VW's financing arm to a record high.

Prospering in the pandemic: winners and losers emerge from Covid chaos;
Apple and peers top the list of gainers since January 2020 while China's
Alibaba leads the failure board, Peloton joins start-ups whose early
lustre has faded and energy groups enjoy a bounce

Body

Two years after the emergence of Covid-19, a jarring disconnect has
emerged between the human toll and the record valuations of many large
companies. Silicon Valley dominates our list of companies whose market
value grew the most in dollar terms since January 1 2020, headed by
Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft.

But non-tech groups were winners too: consultants Accenture, diagnostics
specialist Thermo Fisher and retailer Home Depot all made the top 20.

Nor is it purely a US list, with companies such as Canada's Shopify and
France's LVMH included.

Although China is represented - by battery maker CATL and spirits
producer Kweichow Moutai - many of its big companies had a rough ride in
2021, as they faced increasing regulatory pressure. Alibaba heads our
list of biggest pandemic losers, which also includes battered property
developer Evergrande.

We also highlight companies, such as Zoom Video and Peloton, that faded
after an initial rush of excitement about their prospects. Finally come
the bouncers, including energy groups such as Gazprom and banks such as
BNP Paribas, which endured sharp sell-offs but recovered strongly.

For the full list of pandemic winners, losers, faders and bouncers, see
www.ft.com.

Tom Braithwaite 1. Apple Sector: Technology / hardware HQ: Cupertino, US
Apple's stock ended 2021 close to a record, not just for the company but
for any company, ever.

Despite facing supply chain challenges and its stores closing, the
iPhone maker has hit a $3tn market value, almost triple its pandemic low
in March 2020. Employees working from home are spending less on travel
and restaurants but upgrading their iStuff. Patrick McGee in San
Francisco 2. Microsoft Sector: Software HQ: Redmond, US With the
pandemic accelerating the shift to cloud computing, Microsoft is firing
on all cylinders. Its Azure cloud platform and Office 365 tools have
been a mainstay.

But Microsoft has a finger in many digital pies, including the hiring
market (LinkedIn), business applications (Dynamics) and gaming (Xbox).
Growth is above 20 per cent for the first time in a decade. Richard
Waters in San Francisco 3. Alphabet Sector: Internet HQ: Mountain View,
US Google's parent went into the pandemic as a powerful advertising
company. It is coming out of it as one of the main engines of a booming
digital economy.

Retailers' much greater reliance on digital sales has fed its search and
YouTube advertising, while its cloud computing division is finally
justifying its billing as a third participant behind Amazon and
Microsoft. Late in the year, growth jumped to 40 per cent.

Regulators are circling. but Wall Street sees no immediate threat.
Richard Waters 4. Tesla Sector: Automotive HQ: Austin, US The electric
car pioneer became the first $1tn carmaker and made its co-founder and
chief executive the richest man.

To many, the stock price seems absurd, but even looking five years out,
it is unlikely that any of its much larger rivals will outpace Tesla in
producing electric vehicles - and those are the only vehicles investors
care about. Patrick McGee 5. Amazon Sector: Ecommerce HQ: Seattle, US
With Jeff Bezos busy blasting himself to space, chief Andy Jassy took
over in July. Since then, the costs of doing business during Covid-19
have throttled growth and profits, with billions spent on keep- ing
Amazon's reputation for fast delivery intact.

The stock underperformed compared with most big tech groups, but
analysts are optimistic. Staffing costs should drop in 2022, while the
company's emerging advertising business is shaping up as a bona fide
challenger to the Google and Facebook duopoly. Dave Lee in San Francisco
6. Nvidia Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Santa Clara, US No other chip
company has ridden the pandemic wave as well as Nvidia.

Its graphics chips have become the main workhorse behind artificial
intelligence and other data-intensive applications that are fuelling the
rise of giant cloud data centres. The high-end gaming market and a
useful sideline in selling chips to cryptominers have been a bonus.

Its next target: the metaverse, where it is building a platform for
other companies that want to reach their customers in new virtual
worlds. Richard Waters 7. Meta Platforms Sector: Internet HQ: Menlo
Park, US It has been a bruising year for Meta (formerly Facebook),
battered by accusations that its poor moderation contributed to
January's Capitol riots, whistleblower allegations that it prioritises
profits over safety and new regulatory investigations.

Nevertheless, its share price has weathered the reputational hits,
reaching a record $1tn for the first time in June. Its resilience is
testimony to the booming digital advertising market.

It is now in a headlong dash to build its version of the metaverse.
Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Hsinchu, Taiwan The largest
manufacturer of made-toorder chips has not only been boosted by a leap
in demand for electronics gadgets during the pandemic. It also expects
to keep growing faster until 2025 as 5G and AI further push the use of
semiconductors in everything from factories to cars to homes.

TSMC is boosting investment in new plants from an average 30 per cent of
revenue to more than 40 per cent. The goal is to widen the lead it has
over competitors such as Samsung and Intel. Kathrin Hille in Taipei 9.
ASML Sector: Semiconductor equipment HQ: Veldhoven, Netherlands Of the
many businesses claiming to be "the most important tech company you have
never heard of", Dutch machinemaker ASML has perhaps the best case.

A Philips spinout, it is the leading manufacturer of the enormous
lithography systems used by virtually all chip producers, including
Taiwan's TSMC.

The rush to expand semiconductor manufacturing capacity helped ASML sell
a record number of its most advanced machines this year, boosting
profits more than 60 per cent in its most recent quarter. Joe Miller in
Frankfurt 10. The Home Depot Sector: Retail HQ: Atlanta, US Consumers
have spent more time at home than usual during the pandemic, prompting
them to spruce up their living spaces with everything from a fresh coat
of paint to new backyard furniture.

The do-it-yourself frenzy has been a boon to Home Depot, the largest US
home-improvement retailer. Matthew Rocco in New York 11. UnitedHealth
Sector: Healthcare HQ: Minnetonka, us

The biggest US health insurer has benefited from an uplift in healthcare
spending and enhanced collaboration between its insurance and services
units.

It has added 2m health insurance customers since the end of 2020 and has
50m customers. Jamie Smyth in New York 12. Kweichow Moutai Sector:
Beverages HQ: Zunyi, china State-backed Kweichow Moutai, the premium
Chinese liquor maker, posted revenue growth of just 11 per cent in the
first nine months.

However, the growth figure has never been the focus for Chinese stock
pickers, who instead prize the company's 90 per cent gross profit
margins and Moutai's place on the table at almost every business meeting
and upper-class function. Ryan McMorrow in Beijing 13. LVMH Sector:
Luxury goods HQ: Paris, France When Covid arrived, investors feared that
luxury conglomerate LVMH would be hard hit given its heavy reliance on
affluent Chinese tourists taking shopping pilgrimages to Paris and
Milan.

Instead, the sector's undisputed leader has gone from strength to
strength. Analysts expect its sales to be 15 per cent higher than 2019
this year, reaching roughly (EURO)61bn. Leila Abboud in Paris 14.
Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd Sector: Batteries HQ: Ningde,
China's dominant maker of batteries for electric vehicles has boomed
thanks to growing sales to customers such as Tesla, Daimler and BMW and
the country's homegrown electric vehicle manufacturers. Ryan McMorrow
15. Broadcom Sector: Semiconductors HQ: San Jose, US Exposure to a wide
range of chip markets - particularly smartphones, broadband and wireless
networking - left Broadcom well placed for the network investment boom
that has accompanied the growing reliance on digital services.

Wall Street also grew more confident that the chip industry's most
acquisitive company would take a back seat on deals for a while, and
instead reward shareholders with higher dividends and share buybacks.
Richard Waters 16. Thermo Fisher Sector: Life sciences tools HQ:
Waltham, US The scientific equipment maker enjoyed a $7bn revenue boost
during the first three quarters of 2021 from the supply of
pandemic-related products such as Covid tests and raw materials used in
vaccines.

It also expanded through mergers and acquisitions, closing a $17.4bn
deal to acquire clinical research company PPD in December.

It upgraded its 2022 sales and earnings forecasts in October and expects
to generate $37.1bn in revenues next year, up 15 per cent on 2020. Jamie
Smyth 17. Accenture Sector: Professional services HQ: New York, US The
pandemic has forced companies to accelerate plans to operate digitally.
Accenture and other technology consultants have gained mightily from the
flurry of clients spending on digital transformations, cloud computing
and cyber security.

The consultancy reported record revenues of $50.5bn in the year to
August 31. Sales continued to rise in the three months to November 30,
new bookings hit record levels and Accenture added 50,000 people to its
workforce to meet demand. Michael O'Dwyer in London 18. Shopify Sector:
Ecommerce HQ: Ottawa, Canada Shopify had its first ever $1bn revenue
quarter in July, with the Canadian ecommerce company's chief financial
officer telling analysts that online habits formed during 2020 would
endure.

While growth slowed in 2021, analysts see the company as being in prime
position as a facilitator of "omnichannel" retail, a blend of online and
in-store shopping. Dave Lee continued on page 8

Based on 7,600 companies continued from page 7 19. Netflix Sector: Media
HQ: Los Gatos, US With people across the world staying at home during
lockdowns, Netflix added a record 36m subscribers in 2020. That pace
slowed in 2021 as some countries went back to more normal routines.

But Netflix's stock surged again this autumn thanks to a flood of fresh
content, including its biggest hit ever: Squid Game. The South Korean
drama series was viewed by 142m households across the globe, giving
investors renewed confidence that Netflix can produce a smash hit. Anna
Nicolaou in New York 1. Alibaba

Sector: Ecommerce HQ: Hangzhou, China Jack Ma's ecommerce group has been
buffeted by one challenge after another this year.

Ma went missing. Alibaba was hit with a record fine for antitrust
abuses. China authorities stepped up their campaign to dismantle its
fintech arm Ant Group after cancelling its blockbuster initial public
offering. Rivals including Pinduoduo, www.JD.com and ByteDance's Douyin
have stolen away shoppers and its cloud unit lost marquee international
customer TikTok.

As the largest Chinese company listed in New York, its future is doubly
uncertain. Ryan McMorrow 2. AT&T Sector: Telecoms HQ: Dallas, US With
the announcement that it would spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with
rival Discovery, AT&T conceded defeat on its high-stakes Hollywood
gamble.

Slashing the dividend by almost 50 per cent sent its stock sinking.
While exiting its costly media foray is welcomed by investors, the
damage will take longer to undo. AT&T's $80bn acquisition of Warner left
the company saddled in debt, restricting its ability to invest in its
core business: telecoms. Anna Nicolaou 3. Ping An Sector: Insurance HQ:
Shenzhen, China The Chinese insurance group reported its first annual
fall in net profits for more than a decade in 2020.

Despite a rebound in profits in the first quarter of this year, it
suffered from its exposure to indebted developer China Fortune Land
Development, which defaulted on $530m of dollar-denominated debt in
March. The group's share price was later affected by the crisis
surrounding real estate developer China Evergrande and fears of
contagion to the wider Chinese economy. William Langley in Hong Kong 4.
Royal Dutch Shell Sector: Oil and gas HQ: The Hague, Netherlands The
Anglo-Dutch supermajor has struggled to fully recover from a devastating
2020 when Covid restrictions crushed crude demand, sending its shares to
lows not seen since the 1990s.

Oil prices have rebounded and with them profits, dividends and buybacks.
But green headwinds have become stronger and a new strategy for the
transition is yet to convince investors.

With an activist pushing for a break-up, a Dutch court ruling to comply
with and a possible leadership transition to manage, the months ahead
will be challenging. Tom Wilson in London 5. The Boeing Company Sector:
Aerospace HQ: Chicago, US Last year Boeing was still struggling from the
fallout of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max when the pandemic crushed
customers' demand for aircraft. With governments restricting travel,
airlines slashed flying schedules, parked jets and deferred orders for
new ones.

The aerospace manufacturer has also been hampered by production problems
with the 787 Dreamliner that have prevented it from delivering the
widebody for most of the last year. Claire Bushey in Chicago 6.
Anheuser-Busch InBev Sector: Brewers HQ: Leuven, Belgium The pandemic
took the fizz out of drinks sales as lockdowns cut sharply into
high-margin revenue at bars and restaurants.

Shares in the largest brewer suffered more than Carlsberg and Heineken
after it scrapped its interim dividend two years running and reduced its
fullyear payout. Investors have been worried about the group's $83bn
debt pile dating from its 2016 acquisition of SABMiller. But
third-quarter sales surged past pre-pandemic levels and new chief
executive Michel Doukeris has pledged a renewed focus on consumers.
Judith Evans in London 7. Citigroup Sector: Banks HQ: New York, US In
her first earnings call as chief in April, Jane Fraser announced that
Citigroup was putting most of its Asia consumer business up for sale,
which investors took as a sign that it was applying a new sense of
urgency to closing its longstanding profitability gap with megabank
peers.

But progress is slower than many would like. So far, the bank has only
successfully exited three out of the 13 markets it highlighted, and has
booked more than $2bn in losses throughout the process. Imani Moise in
New York 8. Intel Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Santa Clara, US Most chip
companies have thrived as the pandemic stokes demand for all things
digital. Not Intel.

The arrival of a new chief raised hopes that the once impregnable
semiconductor company would get back to competing with TSMC at the
leading edge of advanced chip manufacturing. But with the chip
industry's long investment cycles, and with AMD eating into Intel's PC
and server markets, all investors can see ahead is heavier spending,
with no recovery yet in sight. Richard Waters 9. China Mobile

Sector: Telecoms HQ: Beijing, China US sanctions rolled out in 2020 by
Donald Trump against companies deemed to have links to the Chinese
military hit China Mobile hard.

The share price jumped in January after the New York Stock Exchange
backtracked twice on plans to delist the company to comply with the
sanctions, leading to an appeal from China Mobile and two other telecoms
companies. But they tumbled again when the appeal was rejected in May.
William Langley 10. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Sector:
Banks HQ: Beijing, China The bank, one of China's largest, had a better
year in 2021 than it did in 2020. However, the role played by state
lenders in supporting the Chinese economy in the early days of the
pandemic, followed by exposure to failing distressed debt investor
Huarong and China's property sector dragged down their share prices.

The string of difficulties took the shine off its proposed joint wealth
management company with Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which won
Chinese regulatory approval in May. William Langley 11. Itaú Sector:
Banks HQ: São Paulo, Brazil The saying goes that Brazilian banks profit
even in bad times. Itaú was never an exception. At the height of the
pandemic last year, Brazil's largest lender reported R$19bn ($3.3bn) net
profit.

But the pandemic accelerated structural changes that threaten the
longstanding dominance of traditional lenders. More and more customers
are switching to fintechs or neobanks, such as Nubank, which offer much
easier access to digital products and services. For banking analysts,
the "age of competition" has arrived in Brazil. Bryan Harris in São
Paulo 12. China Construction Bank Sector: Banks HQ: Beijing, China banks
were enlisted to help extend cheap loans to struggling businesses during
the early days of the pandemic, hitting their profits in 2020. Shares in
China Construction Bank, like many domestic rivals, were later hit by
concerns over the health of the country's banking sector after Huarong,
the country's largest distressed debt investor, delayed the release of
its financial results in April. This led to fears that Beijing would
allow a large state-backed institution to default. William Langley 13.
Banco Bradesco Sector: Banks HQ: São Paulo, Brazil Like Itaú, Banco
Bradesco's performance was solid during the height of the pandemic,
reporting R$16.5bn ($2.9bn) in net profits in 2020. But also like Itaú,
the group has a new breed of digital banks snapping at its heels.

Bradesco is considered susceptible because its tech has often lagged
behind that of its main competitors. Rising default rates and
historically low interest rates in the first half also hurt the bottom
lines of Brazilian banks. Bryan Harris 14. BP Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
London, UK Chief executive Bernard Looney, who took the helm at BP in
February 2020, has had a bruising pandemic.

First, the oil price collapsed. Then, days after outlining plans to
invest heavily in clean energy, the stock fell to a 25-year low.

Earnings rebounded this year thanks to rising commodity prices, but
exclusion from the COP26 climate summit showed that neither politicians
nor investors are quite ready to back Looney's green vision for BP's
future. Tom Wilson 15. Merck Sector: Pharma HQ: Kenilworth, US Merck
faces a growth challenge because of the loss of exclusivity on its
multibillion-dollar cancer drug Keytruda towards the end of the decade.
It also lost the race to develop a Covid jab, and its antiviral
treatment, molnupiravir, has failed to live up to its early promise.

The company is chasing mergers and acquisitions to overcome the looming
Keytruda patent cliff, and in November spent $11.5bn on Acceleron
Pharma, a biotech company that develops therapies for rare disease. More
deals are likely in 2022. Jamie Smyth 16. HSBC Sector: Banks HQ: London,
UK

HSBC executives say it is "the biggest international bank in China, as
well as the most international Chinese bank". It has not been a good
time to be either.

HSBC's shares have plunged since the start of 2020 as it has struggled
to navigate US-China geopolitical tensions, Beijing's crackdown on Hong
Kong and questions over London's future post- Brexit. Stephen Morris in
London 17. Wells Fargo Sector: Banks HQ: San Francisco, US Wells Fargo
hoped for a fresh start after years of scandals when it appointed
Charlie Scharf chief executive in late 2019, but turnround efforts took
a back seat once the pandemic hit. Now, Wells looks poised to bounce
back.

Although Scharf's strategy of cutting costs and investing in areas where
the third-largest US bank punches below its weight is hardly novel, his
blunt commentary about Wells' shortcomings gives credibility to its
comeback story. Imani Moise 18. ExxonMobil Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
Irving, US The 2020 pandemic-induced oil crash exposed huge problems at
heavily indebted ExxonMobil, the US's biggest oil company, which by the
end of the year had recorded its first annual loss and been ditched from
the Dow index.

In 2021, activist Engine No 1 defeated Exxon's management, installing
three board directors with a mission to revamp the energy transition
strategy. Its shares regained value as oil prices recovered. Derek
Brower in New York 19. Verizon Communications Sector: Telecoms HQ: New
York, US The US telecoms sector has been in a price war for several
years. In 2021, AT&T upped the ante with its "free phones for all"
campaign, offering discounts even for existing customers, forcing rival
Verizon to broaden its own offers. Anna Nicolaou 20. China Evergrande
Group Sector: Property HQ: Shenzhen, China Some companies default
suddenly. Others prefer to do it gradually.

In August, the most indebted real estate developer, China Evergrande,
warned about stalled projects. But no official confirmation came in
September, when angry retail investors descended on its headquarters and
the group failed to pay international bondholders. In December, Fitch
declared a default. Evergrande declined to comment. Thomas Hale in Hong
Kong ffaaddeerrss 1. China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Sector:
Automotive HQ: Guangzhou, China Shares in Evergrande New Energy Vehicle
Group took off at the start of 2021 after tycoons bought into a share
placement, taking its market valuation to $63bn, eclipsing that of Ford
without selling a single vehicle.

The shares have since collapsed and the company, worth just $4bn, is
being closely watched by international investors in its indebted parent
who believe they may have recourse to it as part of a restructuring
process. Thomas Hale 2. Alibaba Health Information Technology Sector:
Healthcare HQ: Hong Kong The fortunes of Alibaba's healthcare arm have
slid alongside those of its parent, as founder Jack Ma, found himself in
political trouble and Chinese authorities ramped up their scrutiny of
Alibaba's businesses. Ryan McMorrow 3. Peloton Sector: Leisure products
HQ: New York, US Peloton's IPO a few months before the pandemic was
perfectly timed for investors: once the world locked down, home fitness
boomed.

The company's value soared from $8bn to almost $50bn before the
narrative cycled off-track in 2021, and the brand became the butt of
jokes on the

Sex and the City reboot. Patrick McGee 4. Pinduoduo Sector: Ecommerce
HQ: Shanghai, China The China ecommerce group traded blistering growth
for profitability this year, but rather than reinvesting those earnings
or passing them to shareholders, it is donating much of the money to
charity to get in the party's good books. Ryan McMorrow 5. Bilibili
Sector: Interactive home entertainment HQ: Shanghai, China Bilibili
became a darling as users swarmed into its online world of video games,
anime, livestreams and videos. But the party's tech crackdown has taken
some of the wind out of its sails.

Underage gamers, for instance, have had their online time cut to just
three hours a week. Ryan McMorrow 6. Zoom Video Sector: Application
software HQ: San Jose, US The company that became synonymous with
working from home during the pandemic is facing a tougher second act.

Its once-stratospheric growth is projected to fall below 20 per cent
next year as the flow of new customers ebbs and many of the small
businesses that signed up during the crisis abandon the service. Wall
Street still hopes Zoom will break into new markets such as voice
calling. Richard Waters 7. Pinterest Sector: Internet HQ: San Francisco,
US The site reported bumper revenues but struggled to pin down new users
as the world began to reopen and competition rose from deep-pocketed
rivals such as ffaders

Meta and TikTok. Hannah Murphy 1. ConocoPhillips Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
Houston, US The biggest independent oil producer in the US hunkered down
and idled production as the crude price crash of 2020 ravaged the
industry.

Then prices surged and Conoco moved to take advantage, snapping up rival
Concho Resources and Shell's shale assets to build a commanding position
in Texas and New Mexico's Permian Basin. Investors liked the new scale,
but also Conoco's resumption of share buybacks, rising dividend and
focus on capital discipline. Derek Brower 2. Reliance Industries Sector:
Industrial conglomerate HQ: Mumbai, India Reliance chair and India's
richest man Mukesh Ambani is fond of big targets, and 2021 has been
about trying to meet them.

After raising billions from investors, the energy-to-telecoms
conglomerate's plans to launch a low-cost smartphone and take on Amazon
in ecommerce have had limited success. But Reliance's share price has
been boosted by a rebound in demand for oil products. Benjamin Parkin in
New Delhi 3. Siemens Sector: Industrials HQ: Munich, Germany Under new
management after longstanding boss Joe Kaeser dismantled the
conglomerate, a more agile Siemens has benefited from state and central
bank responses to the pandemic. Joe Miller 4. BNP Paribas Sector: Banks
HQ: Paris, France When companies cancelled dividends at the onset of the
pandemic, it caused an ugly blip for BNP Paribas, with losses on complex
derivatives products in its equities division.

But it has emerged as one of the strongest lenders of the health crisis,
and stole a march on hesitant rivals in debt underwriting. Sarah White
in Paris 5. Schlumberger Sector: Energy services HQ: Houston, US The
crude plunge of 2020 and deep capital spending cuts by oil producers
delivered a blow to the sector. Shares in Schlumberger fell more than 70
per cent as the pandemic hit. The recovery since then in oil prices and
drilling activity has boosted revenue, cash flows and share prices.
Derek Brower 6. Rosneft Sector: Oil and gas HQ: Moscow, Russia's top oil
producer had a rough time at the start of the pandemic. The subsequent
oil recovery, along with a weakening rouble, more than doubled Rosneft's
share price from its pandemic low to the end of 2021. Nastassia
Astrasheuskaya in Moscow 7. Volkswagen Sector: Automotive HQ: Wolfsburg,
Germany The second-largest carmaker has benefited from the semiconductor
shortage, which has allowed it to prioritise the production of high-end,
and more profitable, Porsche and Audi models. Soaring used-car prices
have driven profits at VW's financing arm to a record high.

Prospering in the pandemic: winners and losers emerge from Covid chaos;
Apple and peers top the list of gainers since January 2020 while China's
Alibaba leads the failure board, Peloton joins start-ups whose early
lustre has faded and energy groups enjoy a bounce

Body

Two years after the emergence of Covid-19, a jarring disconnect has
emerged between the human toll and the record valuations of many large
companies. Silicon Valley dominates our list of companies whose market
value grew the most in dollar terms since January 1 2020, headed by
Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft.

But non-tech groups were winners too: consultants Accenture, diagnostics
specialist Thermo Fisher and retailer Home Depot all made the top 20.

Nor is it purely a US list, with companies such as Canada's Shopify and
France's LVMH included.

Although China is represented - by battery maker CATL and spirits
producer Kweichow Moutai - many of its big companies had a rough ride in
2021, as they faced increasing regulatory pressure. Alibaba heads our
list of biggest pandemic losers, which also includes battered property
developer Evergrande.

We also highlight companies, such as Zoom Video and Peloton, that faded
after an initial rush of excitement about their prospects. Finally come
the bouncers, including energy groups such as Gazprom and banks such as
BNP Paribas, which endured sharp sell-offs but recovered strongly.

For the full list of pandemic winners, losers, faders and bouncers, see
www.ft.com.

Tom Braithwaite 1. Apple Sector: Technology / hardware HQ: Cupertino, US
Apple's stock ended 2021 close to a record, not just for the company but
for any company, ever.

Despite facing supply chain challenges and its stores closing, the
iPhone maker has hit a $3tn market value, almost triple its pandemic low
in March 2020. Employees working from home are spending less on travel
and restaurants but upgrading their iStuff. Patrick McGee in San
Francisco 2. Microsoft Sector: Software HQ: Redmond, US With the
pandemic accelerating the shift to cloud computing, Microsoft is firing
on all cylinders. Its Azure cloud platform and Office 365 tools have
been a mainstay.

But Microsoft has a finger in many digital pies, including the hiring
market (LinkedIn), business applications (Dynamics) and gaming (Xbox).
Growth is above 20 per cent for the first time in a decade. Richard
Waters in San Francisco 3. Alphabet Sector: Internet HQ: Mountain View,
US Google's parent went into the pandemic as a powerful advertising
company. It is coming out of it as one of the main engines of a booming
digital economy.

Retailers' much greater reliance on digital sales has fed its search and
YouTube advertising, while its cloud computing division is finally
justifying its billing as a third participant behind Amazon and
Microsoft. Late in the year, growth jumped to 40 per cent.

Regulators are circling. but Wall Street sees no immediate threat.
Richard Waters 4. Tesla Sector: Automotive HQ: Austin, US The electric
car pioneer became the first $1tn carmaker and made its co-founder and
chief executive the richest man.

To many, the stock price seems absurd, but even looking five years out,
it is unlikely that any of its much larger rivals will outpace Tesla in
producing electric vehicles - and those are the only vehicles investors
care about. Patrick McGee 5. Amazon Sector: Ecommerce HQ: Seattle, US
With Jeff Bezos busy blasting himself to space, chief Andy Jassy took
over in July. Since then, the costs of doing business during Covid-19
have throttled growth and profits, with billions spent on keep- ing
Amazon's reputation for fast delivery intact.

The stock underperformed compared with most big tech groups, but
analysts are optimistic. Staffing costs should drop in 2022, while the
company's emerging advertising business is shaping up as a bona fide
challenger to the Google and Facebook duopoly. Dave Lee in San Francisco
6. Nvidia Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Santa Clara, US No other chip
company has ridden the pandemic wave as well as Nvidia.

Its graphics chips have become the main workhorse behind artificial
intelligence and other data-intensive applications that are fuelling the
rise of giant cloud data centres. The high-end gaming market and a
useful sideline in selling chips to cryptominers have been a bonus.

Its next target: the metaverse, where it is building a platform for
other companies that want to reach their customers in new virtual
worlds. Richard Waters 7. Meta Platforms Sector: Internet HQ: Menlo
Park, US It has been a bruising year for Meta (formerly Facebook),
battered by accusations that its poor moderation contributed to
January's Capitol riots, whistleblower allegations that it prioritises
profits over safety and new regulatory investigations.

Nevertheless, its share price has weathered the reputational hits,
reaching a record $1tn for the first time in June. Its resilience is
testimony to the booming digital advertising market.

It is now in a headlong dash to build its version of the metaverse.
Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Hsinchu, Taiwan The largest
manufacturer of made-toorder chips has not only been boosted by a leap
in demand for electronics gadgets during the pandemic. It also expects
to keep growing faster until 2025 as 5G and AI further push the use of
semiconductors in everything from factories to cars to homes.

TSMC is boosting investment in new plants from an average 30 per cent of
revenue to more than 40 per cent. The goal is to widen the lead it has
over competitors such as Samsung and Intel. Kathrin Hille in Taipei 9.
ASML Sector: Semiconductor equipment HQ: Veldhoven, Netherlands Of the
many businesses claiming to be "the most important tech company you have
never heard of", Dutch machinemaker ASML has perhaps the best case.

A Philips spinout, it is the leading manufacturer of the enormous
lithography systems used by virtually all chip producers, including
Taiwan's TSMC.

The rush to expand semiconductor manufacturing capacity helped ASML sell
a record number of its most advanced machines this year, boosting
profits more than 60 per cent in its most recent quarter. Joe Miller in
Frankfurt 10. The Home Depot Sector: Retail HQ: Atlanta, US Consumers
have spent more time at home than usual during the pandemic, prompting
them to spruce up their living spaces with everything from a fresh coat
of paint to new backyard furniture.

The do-it-yourself frenzy has been a boon to Home Depot, the largest US
home-improvement retailer. Matthew Rocco in New York 11. UnitedHealth
Sector: Healthcare HQ: Minnetonka, us

The biggest US health insurer has benefited from an uplift in healthcare
spending and enhanced collaboration between its insurance and services
units.

It has added 2m health insurance customers since the end of 2020 and has
50m customers. Jamie Smyth in New York 12. Kweichow Moutai Sector:
Beverages HQ: Zunyi, china State-backed Kweichow Moutai, the premium
Chinese liquor maker, posted revenue growth of just 11 per cent in the
first nine months.

However, the growth figure has never been the focus for Chinese stock
pickers, who instead prize the company's 90 per cent gross profit
margins and Moutai's place on the table at almost every business meeting
and upper-class function. Ryan McMorrow in Beijing 13. LVMH Sector:
Luxury goods HQ: Paris, France When Covid arrived, investors feared that
luxury conglomerate LVMH would be hard hit given its heavy reliance on
affluent Chinese tourists taking shopping pilgrimages to Paris and
Milan.

Instead, the sector's undisputed leader has gone from strength to
strength. Analysts expect its sales to be 15 per cent higher than 2019
this year, reaching roughly (EURO)61bn. Leila Abboud in Paris 14.
Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd Sector: Batteries HQ: Ningde,
China's dominant maker of batteries for electric vehicles has boomed
thanks to growing sales to customers such as Tesla, Daimler and BMW and
the country's homegrown electric vehicle manufacturers. Ryan McMorrow
15. Broadcom Sector: Semiconductors HQ: San Jose, US Exposure to a wide
range of chip markets - particularly smartphones, broadband and wireless
networking - left Broadcom well placed for the network investment boom
that has accompanied the growing reliance on digital services.

Wall Street also grew more confident that the chip industry's most
acquisitive company would take a back seat on deals for a while, and
instead reward shareholders with higher dividends and share buybacks.
Richard Waters 16. Thermo Fisher Sector: Life sciences tools HQ:
Waltham, US The scientific equipment maker enjoyed a $7bn revenue boost
during the first three quarters of 2021 from the supply of
pandemic-related products such as Covid tests and raw materials used in
vaccines.

It also expanded through mergers and acquisitions, closing a $17.4bn
deal to acquire clinical research company PPD in December.

It upgraded its 2022 sales and earnings forecasts in October and expects
to generate $37.1bn in revenues next year, up 15 per cent on 2020. Jamie
Smyth 17. Accenture Sector: Professional services HQ: New York, US The
pandemic has forced companies to accelerate plans to operate digitally.
Accenture and other technology consultants have gained mightily from the
flurry of clients spending on digital transformations, cloud computing
and cyber security.

The consultancy reported record revenues of $50.5bn in the year to
August 31. Sales continued to rise in the three months to November 30,
new bookings hit record levels and Accenture added 50,000 people to its
workforce to meet demand. Michael O'Dwyer in London 18. Shopify Sector:
Ecommerce HQ: Ottawa, Canada Shopify had its first ever $1bn revenue
quarter in July, with the Canadian ecommerce company's chief financial
officer telling analysts that online habits formed during 2020 would
endure.

While growth slowed in 2021, analysts see the company as being in prime
position as a facilitator of "omnichannel" retail, a blend of online and
in-store shopping. Dave Lee continued on page 8

Bottom 15

Based on 7,600 companies continued from page 7 19. Netflix Sector: Media
HQ: Los Gatos, US With people across the world staying at home during
lockdowns, Netflix added a record 36m subscribers in 2020. That pace
slowed in 2021 as some countries went back to more normal routines.

But Netflix's stock surged again this autumn thanks to a flood of fresh
content, including its biggest hit ever: Squid Game. The South Korean
drama series was viewed by 142m households across the globe, giving
investors renewed confidence that Netflix can produce a smash hit. Anna
Nicolaou in New York 1. Alibaba

Sector: Ecommerce HQ: Hangzhou, China Jack Ma's ecommerce group has been
buffeted by one challenge after another this year.

Ma went missing. Alibaba was hit with a record fine for antitrust
abuses. China authorities stepped up their campaign to dismantle its
fintech arm Ant Group after cancelling its blockbuster initial public
offering. Rivals including Pinduoduo, www.JD.com and ByteDance's Douyin
have stolen away shoppers and its cloud unit lost marquee international
customer TikTok.

As the largest Chinese company listed in New York, its future is doubly
uncertain. Ryan McMorrow 2. AT&T Sector: Telecoms HQ: Dallas, US With
the announcement that it would spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with
rival Discovery, AT&T conceded defeat on its high-stakes Hollywood
gamble.

Slashing the dividend by almost 50 per cent sent its stock sinking.
While exiting its costly media foray is welcomed by investors, the
damage will take longer to undo. AT&T's $80bn acquisition of Warner left
the company saddled in debt, restricting its ability to invest in its
core business: telecoms. Anna Nicolaou 3. Ping An Sector: Insurance HQ:
Shenzhen, China The Chinese insurance group reported its first annual
fall in net profits for more than a decade in 2020.

Despite a rebound in profits in the first quarter of this year, it
suffered from its exposure to indebted developer China Fortune Land
Development, which defaulted on $530m of dollar-denominated debt in
March. The group's share price was later affected by the crisis
surrounding real estate developer China Evergrande and fears of
contagion to the wider Chinese economy. William Langley in Hong Kong 4.
Royal Dutch Shell Sector: Oil and gas HQ: The Hague, Netherlands The
Anglo-Dutch supermajor has struggled to fully recover from a devastating
2020 when Covid restrictions crushed crude demand, sending its shares to
lows not seen since the 1990s.

Oil prices have rebounded and with them profits, dividends and buybacks.
But green headwinds have become stronger and a new strategy for the
transition is yet to convince investors.

With an activist pushing for a break-up, a Dutch court ruling to comply
with and a possible leadership transition to manage, the months ahead
will be challenging. Tom Wilson in London 5. The Boeing Company Sector:
Aerospace HQ: Chicago, US Last year Boeing was still struggling from the
fallout of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max when the pandemic crushed
customers' demand for aircraft. With governments restricting travel,
airlines slashed flying schedules, parked jets and deferred orders for
new ones.

The aerospace manufacturer has also been hampered by production problems
with the 787 Dreamliner that have prevented it from delivering the
widebody for most of the last year. Claire Bushey in Chicago 6.
Anheuser-Busch InBev Sector: Brewers HQ: Leuven, Belgium The pandemic
took the fizz out of drinks sales as lockdowns cut sharply into
high-margin revenue at bars and restaurants.

Shares in the largest brewer suffered more than Carlsberg and Heineken
after it scrapped its interim dividend two years running and reduced its
fullyear payout. Investors have been worried about the group's $83bn
debt pile dating from its 2016 acquisition of SABMiller. But
third-quarter sales surged past pre-pandemic levels and new chief
executive Michel Doukeris has pledged a renewed focus on consumers.
Judith Evans in London 7. Citigroup Sector: Banks HQ: New York, US In
her first earnings call as chief in April, Jane Fraser announced that
Citigroup was putting most of its Asia consumer business up for sale,
which investors took as a sign that it was applying a new sense of
urgency to closing its longstanding profitability gap with megabank
peers.

But progress is slower than many would like. So far, the bank has only
successfully exited three out of the 13 markets it highlighted, and has
booked more than $2bn in losses throughout the process. Imani Moise in
New York 8. Intel Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Santa Clara, US Most chip
companies have thrived as the pandemic stokes demand for all things
digital. Not Intel.

The arrival of a new chief raised hopes that the once impregnable
semiconductor company would get back to competing with TSMC at the
leading edge of advanced chip manufacturing. But with the chip
industry's long investment cycles, and with AMD eating into Intel's PC
and server markets, all investors can see ahead is heavier spending,
with no recovery yet in sight. Richard Waters 9. China Mobile

Sector: Telecoms HQ: Beijing, China US sanctions rolled out in 2020 by
Donald Trump against companies deemed to have links to the Chinese
military hit China Mobile hard.

The share price jumped in January after the New York Stock Exchange
backtracked twice on plans to delist the company to comply with the
sanctions, leading to an appeal from China Mobile and two other telecoms
companies. But they tumbled again when the appeal was rejected in May.
William Langley 10. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Sector:
Banks HQ: Beijing, China The bank, one of China's largest, had a better
year in 2021 than it did in 2020. However, the role played by state
lenders in supporting the Chinese economy in the early days of the
pandemic, followed by exposure to failing distressed debt investor
Huarong and China's property sector dragged down their share prices.

The string of difficulties took the shine off its proposed joint wealth
management company with Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which won
Chinese regulatory approval in May. William Langley 11. Itaú Sector:
Banks HQ: São Paulo, Brazil The saying goes that Brazilian banks profit
even in bad times. Itaú was never an exception. At the height of the
pandemic last year, Brazil's largest lender reported R$19bn ($3.3bn) net
profit.

But the pandemic accelerated structural changes that threaten the
longstanding dominance of traditional lenders. More and more customers
are switching to fintechs or neobanks, such as Nubank, which offer much
easier access to digital products and services. For banking analysts,
the "age of competition" has arrived in Brazil. Bryan Harris in São
Paulo 12. China Construction Bank Sector: Banks HQ: Beijing, China banks
were enlisted to help extend cheap loans to struggling businesses during
the early days of the pandemic, hitting their profits in 2020. Shares in
China Construction Bank, like many domestic rivals, were later hit by
concerns over the health of the country's banking sector after Huarong,
the country's largest distressed debt investor, delayed the release of
its financial results in April. This led to fears that Beijing would
allow a large state-backed institution to default. William Langley 13.
Banco Bradesco Sector: Banks HQ: São Paulo, Brazil Like Itaú, Banco
Bradesco's performance was solid during the height of the pandemic,
reporting R$16.5bn ($2.9bn) in net profits in 2020. But also like Itaú,
the group has a new breed of digital banks snapping at its heels.

Bradesco is considered susceptible because its tech has often lagged
behind that of its main competitors. Rising default rates and
historically low interest rates in the first half also hurt the bottom
lines of Brazilian banks. Bryan Harris 14. BP Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
London, UK Chief executive Bernard Looney, who took the helm at BP in
February 2020, has had a bruising pandemic.

First, the oil price collapsed. Then, days after outlining plans to
invest heavily in clean energy, the stock fell to a 25-year low.

Earnings rebounded this year thanks to rising commodity prices, but
exclusion from the COP26 climate summit showed that neither politicians
nor investors are quite ready to back Looney's green vision for BP's
future. Tom Wilson 15. Merck Sector: Pharma HQ: Kenilworth, US Merck
faces a growth challenge because of the loss of exclusivity on its
multibillion-dollar cancer drug Keytruda towards the end of the decade.
It also lost the race to develop a Covid jab, and its antiviral
treatment, molnupiravir, has failed to live up to its early promise.

The company is chasing mergers and acquisitions to overcome the looming
Keytruda patent cliff, and in November spent $11.5bn on Acceleron
Pharma, a biotech company that develops therapies for rare disease. More
deals are likely in 2022. Jamie Smyth 16. HSBC Sector: Banks HQ: London,
UK

HSBC executives say it is "the biggest international bank in China, as
well as the most international Chinese bank". It has not been a good
time to be either.

HSBC's shares have plunged since the start of 2020 as it has struggled
to navigate US-China geopolitical tensions, Beijing's crackdown on Hong
Kong and questions over London's future post- Brexit. Stephen Morris in
London 17. Wells Fargo Sector: Banks HQ: San Francisco, US Wells Fargo
hoped for a fresh start after years of scandals when it appointed
Charlie Scharf chief executive in late 2019, but turnround efforts took
a back seat once the pandemic hit. Now, Wells looks poised to bounce
back.

Although Scharf's strategy of cutting costs and investing in areas where
the third-largest US bank punches below its weight is hardly novel, his
blunt commentary about Wells' shortcomings gives credibility to its
comeback story. Imani Moise 18. ExxonMobil Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
Irving, US The 2020 pandemic-induced oil crash exposed huge problems at
heavily indebted ExxonMobil, the US's biggest oil company, which by the
end of the year had recorded its first annual loss and been ditched from
the Dow index.

In 2021, activist Engine No 1 defeated Exxon's management, installing
three board directors with a mission to revamp the energy transition
strategy. Its shares regained value as oil prices recovered. Derek
Brower in New York 19. Verizon Communications Sector: Telecoms HQ: New
York, US The US telecoms sector has been in a price war for several
years. In 2021, AT&T upped the ante with its "free phones for all"
campaign, offering discounts even for existing customers, forcing rival
Verizon to broaden its own offers. Anna Nicolaou 20. China Evergrande
Group Sector: Property HQ: Shenzhen, China Some companies default
suddenly. Others prefer to do it gradually.

In August, the most indebted real estate developer, China Evergrande,
warned about stalled projects. But no official confirmation came in
September, when angry retail investors descended on its headquarters and
the group failed to pay international bondholders. In December, Fitch
declared a default. Evergrande declined to comment. Thomas Hale in Hong
Kong ffaaddeerrss 1. China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Sector:
Automotive HQ: Guangzhou, China Shares in Evergrande New Energy Vehicle
Group took off at the start of 2021 after tycoons bought into a share
placement, taking its market valuation to $63bn, eclipsing that of Ford
without selling a single vehicle.

The shares have since collapsed and the company, worth just $4bn, is
being closely watched by international investors in its indebted parent
who believe they may have recourse to it as part of a restructuring
process. Thomas Hale 2. Alibaba Health Information Technology Sector:
Healthcare HQ: Hong Kong The fortunes of Alibaba's healthcare arm have
slid alongside those of its parent, as founder Jack Ma, found himself in
political trouble and Chinese authorities ramped up their scrutiny of
Alibaba's businesses. Ryan McMorrow 3. Peloton Sector: Leisure products
HQ: New York, US Peloton's IPO a few months before the pandemic was
perfectly timed for investors: once the world locked down, home fitness

but also Conoco's resumption of share buybacks, rising dividend and
focus on capital discipline. Derek Brower 2. Reliance Industries Sector:

richest man Mukesh Ambani is fond of big targets, and 2021 has been
about trying to meet them.

After raising billions from investors, the energy-to-telecoms
conglomerate's plans to launch a low-cost smartphone and take on Amazon

and stole a march on hesitant rivals in debt underwriting. Sarah White
in Paris 5. Schlumberger Sector: Energy services HQ: Houston, US The
crude plunge of 2020 and deep capital spending cuts by oil producers
delivered a blow to the sector. Shares in Schlumberger fell more than 70

drilling activity has boosted revenue, cash flows and share prices.

Prospering in the pandemic: winners and losers emerge from Covid chaos;
Apple and peers top the list of gainers since January 2020 while China's
Alibaba leads the failure board, Peloton joins start-ups whose early
lustre has faded and energy groups enjoy a bounce

Two years after the emergence of Covid-19, a jarring disconnect has
emerged between the human toll and the record valuations of many large
companies. Silicon Valley dominates our list of companies whose market
value grew the most in dollar terms since January 1 2020, headed by
Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft.

But non-tech groups were winners too: consultants Accenture, diagnostics
specialist Thermo Fisher and retailer Home Depot all made the top 20.

Nor is it purely a US list, with companies such as Canada's Shopify and
France's LVMH included.

Although China is represented - by battery maker CATL and spirits
producer Kweichow Moutai - many of its big companies had a rough ride in
2021, as they faced increasing regulatory pressure. Alibaba heads our
list of biggest pandemic losers, which also includes battered property
developer Evergrande.

We also highlight companies, such as Zoom Video and Peloton, that faded
after an initial rush of excitement about their prospects. Finally come
the bouncers, including energy groups such as Gazprom and banks such as
BNP Paribas, which endured sharp sell-offs but recovered strongly.

For the full list of pandemic winners, losers, faders and bouncers, see
www.ft.com.

Tom Braithwaite 1. Apple Sector: Technology / hardware HQ: Cupertino, US
Apple's stock ended 2021 close to a record, not just for the company but
for any company, ever.

Despite facing supply chain challenges and its stores closing, the
iPhone maker has hit a $3tn market value, almost triple its pandemic low
in March 2020. Employees working from home are spending less on travel
and restaurants but upgrading their iStuff. Patrick McGee in San
Francisco 2. Microsoft Sector: Software HQ: Redmond, US With the
pandemic accelerating the shift to cloud computing, Microsoft is firing
on all cylinders. Its Azure cloud platform and Office 365 tools have
been a mainstay.

But Microsoft has a finger in many digital pies, including the hiring
market (LinkedIn), business applications (Dynamics) and gaming (Xbox).
Growth is above 20 per cent for the first time in a decade. Richard
Waters in San Francisco 3. Alphabet Sector: Internet HQ: Mountain View,
US Google's parent went into the pandemic as a powerful advertising
company. It is coming out of it as one of the main engines of a booming
digital economy.

Retailers' much greater reliance on digital sales has fed its search and
YouTube advertising, while its cloud computing division is finally
justifying its billing as a third participant behind Amazon and
Microsoft. Late in the year, growth jumped to 40 per cent.

Regulators are circling. but Wall Street sees no immediate threat.
Richard Waters 4. Tesla Sector: Automotive HQ: Austin, US The electric
car pioneer became the first $1tn carmaker and made its co-founder and
chief executive the richest man.

To many, the stock price seems absurd, but even looking five years out,
it is unlikely that any of its much larger rivals will outpace Tesla in
producing electric vehicles - and those are the only vehicles investors
care about. Patrick McGee 5. Amazon Sector: Ecommerce HQ: Seattle, US
With Jeff Bezos busy blasting himself to space, chief Andy Jassy took
over in July. Since then, the costs of doing business during Covid-19
have throttled growth and profits, with billions spent on keep- ing
Amazon's reputation for fast delivery intact.

The stock underperformed compared with most big tech groups, but
analysts are optimistic. Staffing costs should drop in 2022, while the
company's emerging advertising business is shaping up as a bona fide
challenger to the Google and Facebook duopoly. Dave Lee in San Francisco
6. Nvidia Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Santa Clara, US No other chip
company has ridden the pandemic wave as well as Nvidia.

Its graphics chips have become the main workhorse behind artificial
intelligence and other data-intensive applications that are fuelling the
rise of giant cloud data centres. The high-end gaming market and a
useful sideline in selling chips to cryptominers have been a bonus.

Its next target: the metaverse, where it is building a platform for
other companies that want to reach their customers in new virtual
worlds. Richard Waters 7. Meta Platforms Sector: Internet HQ: Menlo
Park, US It has been a bruising year for Meta (formerly Facebook),
battered by accusations that its poor moderation contributed to
January's Capitol riots, whistleblower allegations that it prioritises
profits over safety and new regulatory investigations.

Nevertheless, its share price has weathered the reputational hits,
reaching a record $1tn for the first time in June. Its resilience is
testimony to the booming digital advertising market.

It is now in a headlong dash to build its version of the metaverse.
Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Hsinchu, Taiwan The largest
manufacturer of made-toorder chips has not only been boosted by a leap
in demand for electronics gadgets during the pandemic. It also expects
to keep growing faster until 2025 as 5G and AI further push the use of
semiconductors in everything from factories to cars to homes.

TSMC is boosting investment in new plants from an average 30 per cent of
revenue to more than 40 per cent. The goal is to widen the lead it has
over competitors such as Samsung and Intel. Kathrin Hille in Taipei 9.
ASML Sector: Semiconductor equipment HQ: Veldhoven, Netherlands Of the
many businesses claiming to be "the most important tech company you have
never heard of", Dutch machinemaker ASML has perhaps the best case.

A Philips spinout, it is the leading manufacturer of the enormous
lithography systems used by virtually all chip producers, including
Taiwan's TSMC.

The rush to expand semiconductor manufacturing capacity helped ASML sell
a record number of its most advanced machines this year, boosting
profits more than 60 per cent in its most recent quarter. Joe Miller in
Frankfurt 10. The Home Depot Sector: Retail HQ: Atlanta, US Consumers
have spent more time at home than usual during the pandemic, prompting
them to spruce up their living spaces with everything from a fresh coat
of paint to new backyard furniture.

The do-it-yourself frenzy has been a boon to Home Depot, the largest US
home-improvement retailer. Matthew Rocco in New York 11. UnitedHealth
Sector: Healthcare HQ: Minnetonka, us

The biggest US health insurer has benefited from an uplift in healthcare
spending and enhanced collaboration between its insurance and services
units.

It has added 2m health insurance customers since the end of 2020 and has
50m customers. Jamie Smyth in New York 12. Kweichow Moutai Sector:
Beverages HQ: Zunyi, china State-backed Kweichow Moutai, the premium
Chinese liquor maker, posted revenue growth of just 11 per cent in the
first nine months.

However, the growth figure has never been the focus for Chinese stock
pickers, who instead prize the company's 90 per cent gross profit
margins and Moutai's place on the table at almost every business meeting
and upper-class function. Ryan McMorrow in Beijing 13. LVMH Sector:
Luxury goods HQ: Paris, France When Covid arrived, investors feared that
luxury conglomerate LVMH would be hard hit given its heavy reliance on
affluent Chinese tourists taking shopping pilgrimages to Paris and
Milan.

Instead, the sector's undisputed leader has gone from strength to
strength. Analysts expect its sales to be 15 per cent higher than 2019
this year, reaching roughly (EURO)61bn. Leila Abboud in Paris 14.
Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd Sector: Batteries HQ: Ningde,
China's dominant maker of batteries for electric vehicles has boomed
thanks to growing sales to customers such as Tesla, Daimler and BMW and
the country's homegrown electric vehicle manufacturers. Ryan McMorrow
15. Broadcom Sector: Semiconductors HQ: San Jose, US Exposure to a wide
range of chip markets - particularly smartphones, broadband and wireless
networking - left Broadcom well placed for the network investment boom
that has accompanied the growing reliance on digital services.

Wall Street also grew more confident that the chip industry's most
acquisitive company would take a back seat on deals for a while, and
instead reward shareholders with higher dividends and share buybacks.
Richard Waters 16. Thermo Fisher Sector: Life sciences tools HQ:
Waltham, US The scientific equipment maker enjoyed a $7bn revenue boost
during the first three quarters of 2021 from the supply of
pandemic-related products such as Covid tests and raw materials used in
vaccines.

It also expanded through mergers and acquisitions, closing a $17.4bn
deal to acquire clinical research company PPD in December.

It upgraded its 2022 sales and earnings forecasts in October and expects
to generate $37.1bn in revenues next year, up 15 per cent on 2020. Jamie
Smyth 17. Accenture Sector: Professional services HQ: New York, US The
pandemic has forced companies to accelerate plans to operate digitally.
Accenture and other technology consultants have gained mightily from the
flurry of clients spending on digital transformations, cloud computing
and cyber security.

The consultancy reported record revenues of $50.5bn in the year to
August 31. Sales continued to rise in the three months to November 30,
new bookings hit record levels and Accenture added 50,000 people to its
workforce to meet demand. Michael O'Dwyer in London 18. Shopify Sector:
Ecommerce HQ: Ottawa, Canada Shopify had its first ever $1bn revenue
quarter in July, with the Canadian ecommerce company's chief financial
officer telling analysts that online habits formed during 2020 would
endure.

While growth slowed in 2021, analysts see the company as being in prime
position as a facilitator of "omnichannel" retail, a blend of online and
in-store shopping. Dave Lee continued on page 10

Bottom 15

Based on 7,600 companies continued from page 9 19. Netflix Sector: Media
HQ: Los Gatos, US With people across the world staying at home during
lockdowns, Netflix added a record 36m subscribers in 2020. That pace
slowed in 2021 as some countries went back to more normal routines.

But Netflix's stock surged again this autumn thanks to a flood of fresh
content, including its biggest hit ever: Squid Game. The South Korean
drama series was viewed by 142m households across the globe, giving
investors renewed confidence that Netflix can produce a smash hit. Anna
Nicolaou in New York 1. Alibaba

Sector: Ecommerce HQ: Hangzhou, China Jack Ma's ecommerce group has been
buffeted by one challenge after another this year.

Ma went missing. Alibaba was hit with a record fine for antitrust
abuses. China authorities stepped up their campaign to dismantle its
fintech arm Ant Group after cancelling its blockbuster initial public
offering. Rivals including Pinduoduo, www.JD.com and ByteDance's Douyin
have stolen away shoppers and its cloud unit lost marquee international
customer TikTok.

As the largest Chinese company listed in New York, its future is doubly
uncertain. Ryan McMorrow 2. AT&T Sector: Telecoms HQ: Dallas, US With
the announcement that it would spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with
rival Discovery, AT&T conceded defeat on its high-stakes Hollywood
gamble.

Slashing the dividend by almost 50 per cent sent its stock sinking.
While exiting its costly media foray is welcomed by investors, the
damage will take longer to undo. AT&T's $80bn acquisition of Warner left
the company saddled in debt, restricting its ability to invest in its
core business: telecoms. Anna Nicolaou 3. Ping An Sector: Insurance HQ:
Shenzhen, China The Chinese insurance group reported its first annual
fall in net profits for more than a decade in 2020.

Despite a rebound in profits in the first quarter of this year, it
suffered from its exposure to indebted developer China Fortune Land
Development, which defaulted on $530m of dollar-denominated debt in
March. The group's share price was later affected by the crisis
surrounding real estate developer China Evergrande and fears of
contagion to the wider Chinese economy. William Langley in Hong Kong 4.
Royal Dutch Shell Sector: Oil and gas HQ: The Hague, Netherlands The
Anglo-Dutch supermajor has struggled to fully recover from a devastating
2020 when Covid restrictions crushed crude demand, sending its shares to
lows not seen since the 1990s.

Oil prices have rebounded and with them profits, dividends and buybacks.
But green headwinds have become stronger and a new strategy for the
transition is yet to convince investors.

With an activist pushing for a break-up, a Dutch court ruling to comply
with and a possible leadership transition to manage, the months ahead
will be challenging. Tom Wilson in London 5. The Boeing Company Sector:
Aerospace HQ: Chicago, US Last year Boeing was still struggling from the
fallout of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max when the pandemic crushed
customers' demand for aircraft. With governments restricting travel,
airlines slashed flying schedules, parked jets and deferred orders for
new ones.

The aerospace manufacturer has also been hampered by production problems
with the 787 Dreamliner that have prevented it from delivering the
widebody for most of the last year. Claire Bushey in Chicago 6.
Anheuser-Busch InBev Sector: Brewers HQ: Leuven, Belgium The pandemic
took the fizz out of drinks sales as lockdowns cut sharply into
high-margin revenue at bars and restaurants.

Shares in the largest brewer suffered more than Carlsberg and Heineken
after it scrapped its interim dividend two years running and reduced its
fullyear payout. Investors have been worried about the group's $83bn
debt pile dating from its 2016 acquisition of SABMiller. But
third-quarter sales surged past pre-pandemic levels and new chief
executive Michel Doukeris has pledged a renewed focus on consumers.
Judith Evans in London 7. Citigroup Sector: Banks HQ: New York, US In
her first earnings call as chief in April, Jane Fraser announced that
Citigroup was putting most of its Asia consumer business up for sale,
which investors took as a sign that it was applying a new sense of
urgency to closing its longstanding profitability gap with megabank
peers.

But progress is slower than many would like. So far, the bank has only
successfully exited three out of the 13 markets it highlighted, and has
booked more than $2bn in losses throughout the process. Imani Moise in
New York 8. Intel Sector: Semiconductors HQ: Santa Clara, US Most chip
companies have thrived as the pandemic stokes demand for all things
digital. Not Intel.

The arrival of a new chief raised hopes that the once impregnable
semiconductor company would get back to competing with TSMC at the
leading edge of advanced chip manufacturing. But with the chip
industry's long investment cycles, and with AMD eating into Intel's PC
and server markets, all investors can see ahead is heavier spending,
with no recovery yet in sight. Richard Waters 9. China Mobile

Sector: Telecoms HQ: Beijing, China US sanctions rolled out in 2020 by
Donald Trump against companies deemed to have links to the Chinese
military hit China Mobile hard.

The share price jumped in January after the New York Stock Exchange
backtracked twice on plans to delist the company to comply with the
sanctions, leading to an appeal from China Mobile and two other telecoms
companies. But they tumbled again when the appeal was rejected in May.
William Langley 10. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Sector:
Banks HQ: Beijing, China The bank, one of China's largest, had a better
year in 2021 than it did in 2020. However, the role played by state
lenders in supporting the Chinese economy in the early days of the
pandemic, followed by exposure to failing distressed debt investor
Huarong and China's property sector dragged down their share prices.

The string of difficulties took the shine off its proposed joint wealth
management company with Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which won
Chinese regulatory approval in May. William Langley 11. Itaú Sector:
Banks HQ: São Paulo, Brazil The saying goes that Brazilian banks profit
even in bad times. Itaú was never an exception. At the height of the
pandemic last year, Brazil's largest lender reported R$19bn ($3.3bn) net
profit.

But the pandemic accelerated structural changes that threaten the
longstanding dominance of traditional lenders. More and more customers
are switching to fintechs or neobanks, such as Nubank, which offer much
easier access to digital products and services. For banking analysts,
the "age of competition" has arrived in Brazil. Bryan Harris in São
Paulo 12. China Construction Bank Sector: Banks HQ: Beijing, China banks
were enlisted to help extend cheap loans to struggling businesses during
the early days of the pandemic, hitting their profits in 2020. Shares in
China Construction Bank, like many domestic rivals, were later hit by
concerns over the health of the country's banking sector after Huarong,
the country's largest distressed debt investor, delayed the release of
its financial results in April. This led to fears that Beijing would
allow a large state-backed institution to default. William Langley 13.
Banco Bradesco Sector: Banks HQ: São Paulo, Brazil Like Itaú, Banco
Bradesco's performance was solid during the height of the pandemic,
reporting R$16.5bn ($2.9bn) in net profits in 2020. But also like Itaú,
the group has a new breed of digital banks snapping at its heels.

Bradesco is considered susceptible because its tech has often lagged
behind that of its main competitors. Rising default rates and
historically low interest rates in the first half also hurt the bottom
lines of Brazilian banks. Bryan Harris 14. BP Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
London, UK Chief executive Bernard Looney, who took the helm at BP in
February 2020, has had a bruising pandemic.

First, the oil price collapsed. Then, days after outlining plans to
invest heavily in clean energy, the stock fell to a 25-year low.

Earnings rebounded this year thanks to rising commodity prices, but
exclusion from the COP26 climate summit showed that neither politicians
nor investors are quite ready to back Looney's green vision for BP's
future. Tom Wilson 15. Merck Sector: Pharma HQ: Kenilworth, US Merck
faces a growth challenge because of the loss of exclusivity on its
multibillion-dollar cancer drug Keytruda towards the end of the decade.
It also lost the race to develop a Covid jab, and its antiviral
treatment, molnupiravir, has failed to live up to its early promise.

The company is chasing mergers and acquisitions to overcome the looming
Keytruda patent cliff, and in November spent $11.5bn on Acceleron
Pharma, a biotech company that develops therapies for rare disease. More
deals are likely in 2022. Jamie Smyth 16. HSBC Sector: Banks HQ: London,
UK

HSBC executives say it is "the biggest international bank in China, as
well as the most international Chinese bank". It has not been a good
time to be either.

HSBC's shares have plunged since the start of 2020 as it has struggled
to navigate US-China geopolitical tensions, Beijing's crackdown on Hong
Kong and questions over London's future post- Brexit. Stephen Morris in
London 17. Wells Fargo Sector: Banks HQ: San Francisco, US Wells Fargo
hoped for a fresh start after years of scandals when it appointed
Charlie Scharf chief executive in late 2019, but turnround efforts took
a back seat once the pandemic hit. Now, Wells looks poised to bounce
back.

Although Scharf's strategy of cutting costs and investing in areas where
the third-largest US bank punches below its weight is hardly novel, his
blunt commentary about Wells' shortcomings gives credibility to its
comeback story. Imani Moise 18. ExxonMobil Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
Irving, US The 2020 pandemic-induced oil crash exposed huge problems at
heavily indebted ExxonMobil, the US's biggest oil company, which by the
end of the year had recorded its first annual loss and been ditched from
the Dow index.

In 2021, activist Engine No 1 defeated Exxon's management, installing
three board directors with a mission to revamp the energy transition
strategy. Its shares regained value as oil prices recovered. Derek
Brower in New York 19. Verizon Communications Sector: Telecoms HQ: New
York, US The US telecoms sector has been in a price war for several
years. In 2021, AT&T upped the ante with its "free phones for all"
campaign, offering discounts even for existing customers, forcing rival
Verizon to broaden its own offers. Anna Nicolaou 20. China Evergrande
Group Sector: Property HQ: Shenzhen, China Some companies default
suddenly. Others prefer to do it gradually.

In August, the most indebted real estate developer, China Evergrande,
warned about stalled projects. But no official confirmation came in
September, when angry retail investors descended on its headquarters and
the group failed to pay international bondholders. In December, Fitch
declared a default. Evergrande declined to comment. Thomas Hale in Hong
Kong ffaaddeerrss 1. China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Sector:
Automotive HQ: Guangzhou, China Shares in Evergrande New Energy Vehicle
Group took off at the start of 2021 after tycoons bought into a share
placement, taking its market valuation to $63bn, eclipsing that of Ford
without selling a single vehicle.

The shares have since collapsed and the company, worth just $4bn, is
being closely watched by international investors in its indebted parent
who believe they may have recourse to it as part of a restructuring
process. Thomas Hale 2. Alibaba Health Information Technology Sector:
Healthcare HQ: Hong Kong The fortunes of Alibaba's healthcare arm have
slid alongside those of its parent, as founder Jack Ma, found himself in
political trouble and Chinese authorities ramped up their scrutiny of
Alibaba's businesses. Ryan McMorrow 3. Peloton Sector: Leisure products
HQ: New York, US Peloton's IPO a few months before the pandemic was
perfectly timed for investors: once the world locked down, home fitness
boomed.

The company's value soared from $8bn to almost $50bn before the
narrative cycled off-track in 2021, and the brand became the butt of
jokes on the

Sex and the City reboot. Patrick McGee 4. Pinduoduo Sector: Ecommerce
HQ: Shanghai, China The China ecommerce group traded blistering growth
for profitability this year, but rather than reinvesting those earnings
or passing them to shareholders, it is donating much of the money to
charity to get in the party's good books. Ryan McMorrow 5. Bilibili

became a darling as users swarmed into its online world of video games,
anime, livestreams and videos. But the party's tech crackdown has taken
some of the wind out of its sails.

Underage gamers, for instance, have had their online time cut to just
three hours a week. Ryan McMorrow 6. Zoom Video Sector: Application
software HQ: San Jose, US The company that became synonymous with
working from home during the pandemic is facing a tougher second act.

Its once-stratospheric growth is projected to fall below 20 per cent
next year as the flow of new customers ebbs and many of the small
businesses that signed up during the crisis abandon the service. Wall
Street still hopes Zoom will break into new markets such as voice

US The site reported bumper revenues but struggled to pin down new users
as the world began to reopen and competition rose from deep-pocketed
rivals such as ffaders

Meta and TikTok. Hannah Murphy 1. ConocoPhillips Sector: Oil and gas HQ:
Houston, US The biggest independent oil producer in the US hunkered down
and idled production as the crude price crash of 2020 ravaged the
industry.

Then prices surged and Conoco moved to take advantage, snapping up rival
Concho Resources and Shell's shale assets to build a commanding position
in Texas and New Mexico's Permian Basin. Investors liked the new scale,
but also Conoco's resumption of share buybacks, rising dividend and
focus on capital discipline. Derek Brower 2. Reliance Industries Sector:
Industrial conglomerate HQ: Mumbai, India Reliance chair and India's

Language rules harm First Nations students; Required exams unfair and a
barrier to success, Denis Gros-Louis says

"Education got us into this mess and education will get us out of it."

This statement, made in 2017 by the Honourable Justice Murray Sinclair,
is as timely as ever, and it should be borne in mind as Quebec
legislators study Bill 96, legislation to amend the French Language
Charter.

Even though Sinclair's statement points to the devastating effects of
the Indian residential school system, and speaks to the complexity of
the history of First Nations education in Canada, it also carries a
message of hope. But if systemic barriers are not overcome through
appropriate legislation, the future will be much less promising and all
hard work in this area will have been futile.

Bill 96 presents an opportunity to change laws and practices that
circumscribe the success of First Nations students in Quebec.

A large proportion of our students are enrolled in the provincial
system, outside of our communities, and are doing everything they can to
get an education in schools where instruction in many cases is in their
second language (their first being an Indigenous language).

Under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the French Language, no student
will be given a high school diploma unless they meet the standards for
knowledge of French set by the province. For students in French high
schools, this means passing a standardized French exam designed for
mother-tongue francophones. Students in English schools are required to
pass a French as second language exam, when for Indigenous youth, French
may be their third language.

Under Chapter VIII.1 of the Charter, CEGEP students, as well, are bound
to fulfil requirements on the use and quality of the French language.

As an Atikamekw student accurately pointed out to me recently:
"Indigenous students always have to work twice as hard to succeed."

The consequences of the language requirements in the Quebec school
system can be quite detrimental for First Nations youth, resulting in
rapid disinterest in school among those who see themselves as lagging
behind and set up for failure from the start. They also feel undervalued
in terms of their mother tongue. This may lead them to become early
school dropouts - often a prelude to societal dropout - which in many
cases only reinforces isolation and marginalization among First Nations
youth in Quebec.

We often see the dream of becoming a professional, tradesperson or
entrepreneur turn into a summit impossible for young people to reach,
largely due to language requirements in the existing law, which are not
changed in Bill 96.

Additionally, even though schools in First Nations communities are not
subject to the Charter and Bill 96, the language requirements therein
are an obstacle to the recruitment of professionals to work in those
schools. With Quebec facing a significant labour shortage in the
education sector, First Nations communities see specialists in Ontario
and New Brunswick, including speech-language pathologists, special
education teachers and psychologists, as a source of much needed
services. However, the exemptions in the Charter of the French Language
or in Bill 96 that would allow out-of-province specialists to exercise
their professions in our schools are too narrow.

We can certainly all agree that the school system is failing students
when even just one drops out.

If the government of Quebec sincerely wants to help First Nations
students, lowering or completely applying an exemption to some of the
language requirements maintained in Bill 96 would be a good start. This
would not be to the detriment of the development of the French language.

Education is fundamental to assuring child development and wellness,
breaking the cycle of poverty, and levelling the playing field.

With Bill 96 under clauseby-clause consideration by legislators, this is
an apt time for a reminder that we all have a duty to ensure that the
rules of the game in Quebec are fair for everyone, and that they foster
First Nations student success. Denis Gros-Louis is director general of
the First Nations Education Council, an association representing 22
First Nation communities. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All

UP consolidate against Assam

Highlight: Fine Knocks By Rinku Singh & Akshdeep Nath All But Clear The
Home Team’s Path Into The Knock-Outs

Body

RANJI TROPHY

Fine knocks by Rinku Singh and skipper Akshdeep Nath helped Uttar
Pradesh push their case for a knock-out berth in the Ranji Trophy
cricket championship strongly at Green Park Stadium on Tuesday.

Rinku batting lower down the order came up with another free-flowing
knock, while Akshdeep did his credentials no harm with a fighting 81.
And at close of play on the second day, the hosts were sitting

pretty at 377/5 after the visitors had put on 175 runs in their first
innings. At draw of stumps Rinku was batting four short of a
well-deserved century, while giving him company was Upendra Yadav with
38.

With UP requiring just three more points to cement their place in the
quarterfinals from Elite Group C, the combined efforts of their bowlers
and batsmen have more or less done what the doctor had ordered. UP have
38 points, while third placed Jharkhand are on 33 points from eight
matches.

Now, if UP collect even three more points they will be out of bounds for
Jharkhand. Rajasthan, who scored an innings' win against Tripura in
their final league match, have already qualified with 51 points.

Resuming at their overnight score of 64/1, UP lost Umang Sharma early
who was trapped in front of the wicket by medium-pacer Mukhtar Hussain.
Mohammad Saif too left with the team 37 runs adrift of the Assam total.

But then, Akshdeep and Priyam Garg realized 93 runs for the fourth
wicket to guide the side past Assam. Garg, who has been in roaring form
this season, couldn't capitalize on the start to come up with a rare
failure by his standards when he fell to off-spinner Gokul Sharma for 44
(87b, 4x6).

Soon after Akshdeep, who had looked composed during his 143-delivery
knock, too was castled by medium-pacer Arup Das. He slammed ten
boundaries.

Still, there was no respite for the visiting bowlers as Rinku Singh in
company with Upendra Yadav grinded down the bowlers by putting on
undefeated 118 runs for the sixth wicket. The two took the tired bowling
to the cleaners with some attractive strokes in the final session of the
day.

Rinku, who likes to dominate the bowling, made sure that the Assam
bowlers don't get any chance to bounce back sending the leather past the
fence eight times and once over it during his 143-ball innings.

Upendra proved to be the ideal foil at the other end as he displayed a
solid defensive technique during his 83-delivery stay at the wicket. In
between, he came up with some cracking strokes to collect five
boundaries.

[The Turning Point] Why Paytm-backed CreditMate pivoted from bike loans
to collections

The Turning Point is a series of short articles that focuses on the
moment when an entrepreneur hit upon their winning idea. Today, we look
at Mumbai-based CreditMate, a collection platform that helps lenders
collect overdue payments from borrowers.

Lending may be one of the most lucrative businesses in a market like
India with numerous creditworthy individuals taking loans for the first
time, but the sector faces one big problem: collections.

This led Jonathan Bill, Swati Lad, Ashish Doshi, and Aditya S to change
CreditMate's model, pivoting from a bike loans startup to a digital
collections platform.

The founders had seen the fantastic results their inbuilt collections
technology offered while running their bike loans service. The
efficiency and optimisation were remarkable, especially when compared to
the collections approach taken by other lenders.

"Therefore, we decided to pivot into the collections software business
and further build on the system we had created," Jonathan says.

Research has found that the process of collections in India is offline,
fragmented, and archaic. It is predominantly dependent on humans who
have gained knowledge from years of collections experience.

When a lender starts operating in a new area/state, it needs to find an
experienced collections team for that specific region. This results in a
highly labour-intensive business.In addition, the borrower experience is
also poor and dis-satisfactory. Lenders tend to attempt to solve
problems for their specific portfolios, and there is no collective
intelligence.

"We came up with a smart, algorithmic platform, which automatically
matches lenders to agencies across regions. It improves speed and
security, and helps lenders track the collection process in real time
with the help of live dashboards, data analytics, and insights,"
Jonathan says.

"If a lender is starting operations in a new region, the collections
process can commence at the click of a button. Furthermore, automated
billing and reconciliation help with overall efficiency," Jonathan says.

Lower repayment failure rates

The startup had built a reasonable bike loans business when it decided
to shift focus. It disbursed close to $14 million in bike loans - mostly
to blue-collar workers - and created a network of about 150 dealers
across Mumbai and Gujarat.

With an average loan size of Rs 50,000, and a longer repayment cycle
compared to peers, CreditMate claims to have brought down repayment
failure rates to under 1 percent.There are 12 lenders on board, and it
has recorded several million dollars in collections so far, with $8
million in June 2019 alone.

The CreditMate Collect Network is operational in 20 Indian states at
present. It consists of 3,120 tele collectors, 3,630 FOS collection
agents, over 250,000 cash drop points, and 1,500 cash pickup agents.

There are multiple payment options, including cash, for borrowers. They
can even book convenient cash pick-up slots.

"We also make sure that our collection agents are vetted to ensure the
highest level of data and cash security. Our technology has led to
roughly 20 percent increased efficiency versus in-house collections, and
is on track to fulfil its vision of empowering borrowers with better
credit scores and lenders with improved lending performance," Jonathan
says.

Outside the Box: Any one of these 15 money-losing companies could become
the stock market's biggest 'unicorn' failure ever

David Rush holds a Guinness world record for cramming 100 candles into
his mouth and lighting them. Sandeep Singh Kaila spun a basketball on a
toothbrush for a record 1 minute and 8.15 seconds. Neville Sharp emitted
a 112.4 decibel burp.

If those zany stunts can make it into the Guinness Book of World
Records, there should be a category for something really important — the
world's biggest startup company failure. There is certainly no shortage
of contenders for this dubious honor.

Before 2015, the biggest bankruptcies (by funding) were Solyndra ($1.2
billion), Abound Solar ($614 million), and Better Place ($675 million).
WebVan got a lot of publicity when it received $275 million in venture
capital funding and failed in 2001 after three years of operation. More
recently, Theranos received $500 million in venture capital funding and
was a well-publicized disaster, with CEO Elizabeth Holmes and president
Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani both convicted of multiple counts of fraud.

Those failures are large, but the cumulative losses of many startups
that have not yet gone bankrupt are orders of magnitude larger. The
table below shows the funds raised by the 15 biggest money-losing
startups in the U.S. Cumulatively they raised $93.8 billion in startup
funds and have lost $135.1 billion.

Only one of these 15 companies has ever had a profitable quarter —
Airbnb had a $378 million profit on $2.1 billion in revenue in the
second quarter of 2022. All of the other startups in the table have
recent losses that exceed 10% of revenue and most exceed 30%.

Any hopeful arguments that profitability is just around the corner ring
hollow when every company is at least nine years old and two are more
than 20 years old. At some point, investors will say, 'Enough is enough'
and realize that it is a sunk-cost fallacy to throw good money after
bad.

Eleven of the 15 companies in the table have raised more money than was
raised by any bankrupt startup. The two biggest losers so far are Uber
and WeWork So far, Uber has cumulative losses of $31.7 billion and
WeWork $20.7 billion, with no end in sight. Uber's stock price is down
about 35% from its 52-week high. WeWork is down 71% and is now
officially a penny stock.

Losses have to be financed and it is increasingly difficult for these
companies to do so. Most of these so-called unicorn startups have seen
their share prices fall more than 50% in the past year, and many of
these stocks are down more than 90%. WeWork isn't the only unicorn
turning into a penny stock.

These stock-price declines will make it increasingly difficult and
expensive to issue more stock in order to raise funds to cover ongoing
losses. Meanwhile, rising interest rates are increasing the cost of
servicing existing debt and making it difficult and expensive to issue
even more debt.

Many unicorns will surely soon go bankrupt or be acquired at fire-sale
prices. A failure of Uber or WeWork would be 10 times larger than the
previous records for lost venture-capital funding. A wave of unicorn
failures would send tremors through financial markets, but it is
unlikely that the federal government would use a 'too-big-too-fail'
excuse to intervene.

Although the startups in the table are U.S. companies, unicorn startups
in other countries have similar problems: European startups (Delivery

); Indian ones (Ola , Paytm , and Zomato

543320,

-3.36%[22]

), and Singaporean ones (Grab and SEA ) also have multi-billion dollar
cumulative losses.

New records among unicorn companies will likely soon be set all over the
world — but they won't be as benign as records for candle stuffing,
basketball spinning, and burping.

An entrepreneur's playbook for 'when the going gets tough'

With the new 'age of startups', most of us are fascinated by
entrepreneurs and their success stories. But the journey of an
entrepreneur is not as glossy as it appears. With a high mortality rate
of about 90 percent in the first year of operation, a plethora of
startups hit failure even before they see the light of the day.

A series of missteps and mistakes - that's an entrepreneur's life before
the right idea is nailed and hailed by the world. On that path, even
though an entrepreneur at times has had to down the shutters, the story
of their 'failure' itself is an important lesson for every other
entrepreneur who aspires to dream and follow their passion to build
something from scratch.

To be sure, there is no magic key that can unlock the correct technique
to become a 'successful entrepreneur', but a series of personal
experiences and learnings can be a survival playbook for young
entrepreneurs aspiring to prove their mettle.

Is it an undying passion or an unfailing vision that keeps you going,
when the going gets tough? Here are a few tips that can help you make
this journey easier!

Be a lifelong learner

A successful entrepreneur never stops learning. While you learn when you
fail, you also learn a lot more when you grow. You have to
learn-unlearn-relearn things in every single phase to stay above the
competition, and learning is not just limited to the core business
competence. During the journey of your venture, at times you play the
role of an HR, and other times you double down as a marketing expert or
people expert.

Keep answering the question of 'why' to yourself

Nothing is certain. In umpteen situations of your entrepreneurial
journey, things won't go as planned. Your day-to-day task of building
your business might defocus you from your vision. Many times, there will
be situations of self-doubt owing to numerous failed tasks. At such
time, you need to remember 'why' you chose to be an entrepreneur in the
first place, and remind yourself about the vision that you have for your
business from time to time.

Accept your 'failure' and learn

For an entrepreneur, success is the most important thing. But it's not
wrong to fail. At times it is necessary to fail in order to be
successful in the long run. Mostly when entrepreneurs fail, they don't
really accept it. Say, 'A failed!', and learn the art of acceptance.
Only then will you be able to motivate yourself to try harder. It's a
lesson that needs to be learned from the circumstances you undergo.
Reflect and learn from it, and as Mark Cuban rightly said, "It doesn't
matter how many times you have failed, you only have to be right once."

Work with a cohesive and collaborative attitude

It's true that it is your business idea, but it's crucial to remember
that it's not just about you. As much as you lead the journey of your
startup, your team is unequivocally part of every crest and trough you
go through in that journey. You need to build your team as one cohesive
unit which works in a collaborative mode, and that is only possible in a
setup that is transparent. "Talent wins games, but teamwork and
intelligence win championships," says Michael Jordan. A business is only
successful if the team is united and focused.

Quality is better than qualification

When building a team, chose quality over qualifications. It's important
to understand if an individual will imbibe the team culture, values, and
vision of your business. Someone who has a low test score, but great
logical thinking capability, may turn out to be more beneficial for your
team.

To sum up, as an entrepreneur, you require more than you anticipate. You
need to be a perpetual learner who looks for new answers every day, and
as Sebastian Thrun, the founder of online education platform Udacity and
considered the father of self-driving technology, once said, "Be
fearless, be curious, and develop a growth mindset. For those who learn,
there is no such thing as a failure."

The ventilator question: Why Covid-19 patients starve of oxygen

India Today Online

April 30, 2020 Thursday 05:18 PM GMT

Length: 718 words

Health experts and authorities maintain that only about 15 per cent of
Covid-19 patients actually need hospitalization, treatment in ICU,
oxygen supply for breathing or ventilator support. Around 1 out of every
6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty
breathing, reads the health ministry explainer on novel coronavirus
outbreak. Yet, the sheer number of deaths due to Covid-19, a disease
caused by novel coronavirus, is overwhelming.

For a normal healthy young woman, the health experts say, Covid-19 is
mostly harmless with a large volume of patients showing mild or no
symptoms of illness. It gets severe in some cases and fatally
complicated in those who have pre-existing health conditions.

Such patients need assisted breathing and need to be taken under
hospital care urgently. Covid-19 causes prolonged and progressive
hypoxia, which is like starving the body of oxygen.

Novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 does this through a chemical action in
the infected person's body. It binds itself to the heme groups in
hemoglobin in red blood cells. This disrupts normal respiration process.

In a normal respiration, hemoglobin works as a carrier that takes waste
carbondioxide to the exhaust system of lungs and in exchanges collects
oxygen from the air chamber. This oxygen helps us live through our
lives.

In Covid-19 patients, the coronavirus blocks hemoglobin from exchanging
carbondixode for oxygen. Patients simply begin desaturating. That is,
they are losing oxygen content in their blood stream.

Normal saturation level shows oxygen level in the body at 95 per cent. A
report by The Lancetsaid the oxygen level can drop to 60 or 50 per cent
in some of Covid-19 patients. In such a situation, oxygen supply to
different organs starts drying up, and eventually organ failures happen.

This is the reason why most of Covid-19 deaths don't happen due to what
doctors call acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - commonly
breathlessness - or pneumonia. These patients are dying of cardiac
problems, kidney failure or similar other conditions.

Lungs get damaged to certain extent in severe cases, with doctors
attributing the damage to the release of iron from hemoglobin by the
virus. CT scans of Covid-19 patients show the evidence, doctors have
pointed out in their studies in China and Europe.

In some cases of re-hospitalisation of cured Covid-19 patients, patients
complained of breathlessness caused by hypoxia. This is has happened
even in the cases when patients have not reported respiratory fatigue.

That is, they are physically capable of respiration - inhaling and
exhaling - but their bodies starve of oxygen. This means that
hemoglobin, the carrier, is still plying like a carriage truck but is
carrying only junk. It is moving up and down the blood stream but not
carrying lifeblood to the organs. The patient may complain of
suffocation just the same way she does in carbon-monoxide poisoning.

If immediate relief through treatment is not provided to the patients,
they face grave risk of death. The ultimate cause of the death could be
cardiac arrest or kidney failure but triggered by oxygen starving of the
body.

A composite and conclusive study detailing the reasons of death of
Covid-19 patients will take time. But a report by The Lancet published
in early April said respiratory failure is "obviously" the main cause.

It had quoted a study conducted in China analyzing the character of
Covid-19 in first 150 patients in Wuhan - 68 had died and 82 discharged.

The researchers found that of those died of Covid-19, 53 per cent
succumbed ultimately to respiratory failure. Another seven per cent died
of circulatory failure (heart condition), which is not unrelated to
oxygen starving. And, 33 per cent died of both. This is a complex
picture.

This behavioural pattern of Covid-19 in human body has led many to
question the approach that emphasizes the need to have more and more
ventilators in hospitals.

Ventilators essential breathes for the patient who cannot mechanically
breathe on her own. Here, the patient is breathing, the hemoglobin may
not be doing its carrier job properly. The jury is still out even as
novel coronavirus shows signs of relent in some countries and
strengthening in some other. India seems to be at the crossroads right
now.

Absence of Basic Amenities: Parshvanath City residents seek FIR against
UMC officials, builders

No water or electricity to combat the searing heat and a lack of
cleanliness allaround has made life miserable for the residents of
Parshvanath City, and their anger boiled over on Monday.

The residents of the most posh colony of the city, who are battling
these problems daily gheraoed the Nagjhiri police station and demanded
registration of a case against the Ujjain Municipal Corporation
officials along with the builders. The colony, developed about 12 years
ago at the wounded-up IISCO Pipe Factory premises on Dewas Road, was
counted among the best colonies of the city till a few years ago. The
reason for this was th eclaims made by the developer about covered
campus, 24 hours electricity, water, wide roads, parks, community halls,
shopping complexes, schools and clubs.

The elite class of the city bought into this dream following which 1100
plots of the colony were sold out. In 2014, as soon as the building
permission was granted, people started building houses and in just one
year 300 families made this are their homes.

As the houses were built, problems started cropping up in the colony
which started with electricity. The coloniser had promised to build a
separate sub-station, but he went back on his promise as soon as the
plot went on sale. Due to this, instances of power failure in the colony
started to crop up. Added to this the problem of water also started.
People gathered resources at their level and carried on the work, but
their anger erupted when the electricity disruptions started getting
longer and longer. The residents knocked on every door to get basic
amenities but the problem was not solved. They had previously
demonstrated at the collector's office and also blocked Dewas Road but
to no avail.

Thus the residents, troubled by the daily problems, gheraoed the
Nagjhiri police station on Monday and after raising slogans, made an
application that an FIR be registered against the builders and the then
corporation officers. Manish Sharma, president of Parshvanath City
Residents Association, said that we went everywhere but we were not
heard anywhere. When the government provides basic facilities in poor
settlements, why can't the facilities be available in our colony.
According to Sharma, not a single promise made by the builders was
fulfilled. No water is available. There is no electricity. There is no
sewerage plant. There will not be any place where we have not
complained. But till now no solution has been found, he added.

Police station-in-charge Vikram Singh Ivne said that residents have
submitted a complaint and they are investigating it and necessary action
will be taken after the investigation.

Nevada Center for Applied Research (NCAR) graduate, Bioelectronica,
applies new round of venture funding to expand hiring and innovation in
digital biochemistry

RENO, Nevada, March 2 -- Bioelectronica issued the following news
release:

Bioelectronica Corporation ("Bioelectronica") announced today the
addition of new members to their team in Reno, NV, as the company
continues to experience growing interest in their drug discovery
platform, Hypercell. The company recently reached critical milestones
and received venture funding from Proxima Ventures. As it expands,
Bioelectronica has been fortunate to interview and hire qualified life
sciences candidates from the local talent pool. Local job creation is a
result of years of work and initiative funding by the State of Nevada to
promote innovation, economic development and workforce development,
especially at NCAR, located on the campus of the University of Nevada,
Reno.

Bioelectronica incubated at NCAR, an exceptionally well-equipped wet
bench facility for emerging early-stage startups, before graduating and
expanding to their new corporate headquarters in Reno. Initially
occupying just a single bench, Bioelectronica is a Nevada biotech
success story that illustrates the benefits of planning and investments
in science, technology and education. The company continues to maintain
a close connection to the University and NCAR as they advance
innovations with their beachhead product Hypercell, the first system to
facilitate single cell sorting and drug discovery using Computer Vision
Single Cell Sorting (CVSCS).

"Bioelectronica blends innovation, science and technology, and
represents an emerging biotech presence in our region. It was a pleasure
to see this company successfully scale-up on the University of Nevada,
Reno campus through our Nevada Center for Applied Research, and they
continue to work with us. This is an example of business and economic
development being supported by the Nevada Knowledge Fund and the
Governor's Office of Economic Development," said Carlos Cardillo,
director of the Nevada Center for Applied Research.

"We plan to put Reno and the State of Nevada on the map for Biotech. The
Governor's Office of Economic Development and the Nevada Knowledge Fund
have created a powerful waterfall effect through their support of NCAR.
Nevada startups like Bioelectronica sit in an innovation ecosystem
fostered by NCAR. We are able to provide employment opportunities to
graduates through jobs creation and in turn, source qualified candidates
in the life sciences to support our growth. In short, we could not have
advanced this quickly without NCAR," said Jonathan Hull, CEO and
co-founder of Bioelectronica.

In an industry where startup failure rates are high, due in large part
to the capital-intensive nature of biotech, Bioelectronica has been able
to prove out their technology because of programs such as the Nevada
Knowledge Fund and NCAR's incubator. Hypercell is now being used in labs
globally to accelerate early-stage drug discovery and development.

About Bioelectronica

Bioelectronica is a research-stage biotechnology company building
intelligent, digital tools for drug discovery, cell screening and cell
sorting. Bioelectronica's platform technology combines computer vision,
biochemical reagents and consumer electronics to accelerate discovery.
We believe that by transforming biochemistry through digital innovation,
we fundamentally change the speed and price of therapeutics discovery
and development. For more information on how your workflow can benefit

Dream, build, grow: 10 startup tips from the Times LitFest 2018

Yourstory.in

Here are ten useful tips for entrepreneurs from the founders of Urban
Ladder, Zerodha, and Medwell Ventures, speaking at the Times LitFest.

The Times LitFest 2018 under way at Bengaluru features a diverse range
of topics: freedom of speech, digital media, historical biographies,
urban identity, translations, crime fiction, pop culture, and the
environment. The fourth edition of the festival, held on February 3 and
4, includes 100 acclaimed authors and speakers, at the picturesque
Jayamahal Palace.

Here are some of my takeaways from the panel titled 'The rise and rise
of entrepreneurship in India,' featuring Sanjay Swamy, Managing Partner
at Prime Venture Partners; Ashish Goel, Co-founder and CEO, Urban
Ladder; Nithin Kamath, Founder and CEO, Zerodha; and Vishal Bali,
Co-founder and Chairman, Medwell Ventures (panel moderator).

See also my takeaways from earlier editions of Times LitFest (2015), as
well as Bangalore Business LitFest (2017, 2016), Jaipur Literature
Festival (2017), and Bangalore Literature Fest (2015).

-   Seize the India moment

"This is an amazing time to be an entrepreneur in India," said Sanjay
Swamy. This opportunity is powered by a confluence of the youth boom,
digital media, startup ecosystem, and widely available online resources.
There will be regulatory hiccups, but the overall momentum is for
creation of new value, especially for end consumers.

To be fair, India has a huge share of problems, but solving these issues
creates opportunities of large scale. This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to build a good company. The West went through its Internet
boom 20 years ago. India is a latecomer, but it's never too late.

3.  Starting right

Startups will succeed if they pick the right problem, market, team,
solution and technology. "Solve a problem which you have experienced
yourself," advised Sanjay. This will help the founders connect better
with customers.

Finding the right space to be in and the right problem to solve may take
several years. "It took us four to five years to figure out what space
to be in for the next 25 years," said Ashish Goel.

He personally experienced the problem of finding the right apartment
furniture, which led him to launch Urban Ladder. This also involved
getting out of the usual comfort zones of tech and management roles.

3.  Contextualise micro and macro trends

You may notice consumer trends in your immediate circles, but see if
they are also part of a bigger pattern. The trend towards aspiring for
good furniture is part of a broader trend of growing design awareness in
India, said Ashish.

From local tailors and corner stores to branded clothes and
supermarkets, consumers have evolved over the decades to look for more
choice in product and design. Sports and culture are the next trends to
watch, said Ashish. The rise in arts and crafts events is a good
reflection of this trend (see the YourStory PhotoSparks article series).

3.  Digital drivers

For startups in digital space, a key driver is the rise of Aadhaar
(despite the controversies over issues like privacy). "In the last one
month, we on-boarded more consumers than in the previous five years,
thanks to Aadhaar," said Nithin Kamath of Zerodha, a fintech company.
The painful process for online traders to fill out long forms and
provide many supporting documents has now been replaced by online
verification via Aadhaar.

Another driver is the recent attractiveness of the 'fintech' tag.
"Online trading was regarded as something for dalals - now our fintech
branding has made it easier to attract talent," joked Nithin.

2.  New business models

Entrepreneurs can find value by digitally enabling a number of sectors
beyond the usual suspects. For example, the startup MyGate offers
platform-based solutions for front-gate security in residential and
commercial buildings.

This at first seemed like an unlikely sector for digitisation, said
Sanjay. Online furniture rental also seemed different for Prime
Ventures, but the founders were convinced they were seeing something
that their investors initially missed.

2.  Network and sell

Great ideas won't get out of garages, labs, cafes and offices unless the
founder networks, builds, recruits and sells. "I connected and reached
out to 300 people on LinkeIn for my furniture rental idea. Only three
responded, but one of them led me to my first hire," recalled Ashish.

There was also the random kindness of total strangers that helped him in
his early days, such as a factory manager on the outskirts of Bengaluru.
(This is also a lesson to others in society to help founders whenever
asked!)

2.  The little things are the big things

Agreeing on vision and mission may be a good start, but, sometimes, even
seemingly smaller things can trip up co-founder relationships. "We
fought over our logo for over two hours, and even after having known
each other for over 10 years, we each said this wasn't going to work,"
recalled Ashish.

See also our review of Cut the Crap and Jargon: Lessons from the Startup
Trenches, by Shradha Sharma and TN Hari. The book highlights the
challenges in areas like setting the right culture and communications in
a fast-growing startup.

2.  Bounce back from failure

Product failure and even company failure may end up tripping many a
founder. "I went bust in 2001 and 2003, and went to work at a call
centre," recalled Nithin. But he stayed active in the trading space, and
eventually founded his trading platform, Zerodha.

"Every business has surprises along the way," cautioned Sanjay; his
investment firm has had its share of "false positives" and "false
negatives" (missed opportunities). If the prize is worth winning, the
founders will learn from failure and persevere.

-   Market distortions

There will be regulatory uncertainties for many entrepreneurs,
especially in sectors like cryptocurrency and the sharing economy (see
our earlier articles on regulation and governance). There will also be
market distortions due to the funding patterns of hyper-funded startups.

There are some companies that may not be able to deliver shareholder
returns, cautioned Ashish. There are many startups in India whose
leadership team has not been through economic boom and bust cycles
either, and do not have this experience of reading market patterns.

-   Show the passion for your brand

Even as a startup grows and recruitment steps up, certain key activities
will continue to demand quality founder attention. "I spend two hours a
day responding to queries on our blog," said Nithin.

Even though some advise him to delegate this to others, Nithin prefers
to keep this customer connect going because that is what his brand was
built on. "Make passion your paycheck," advised Vishal Bali.

Other discussions by the panel focused on how startups can learn and
support one another. The best learning for entrepreneurs generally comes
from other entrepreneurs. "We facilitate conversations between the
founders in our portfolio," said Sanjay.

Indian cities like Bengaluru have a healthy startup ecosystem where many
such forums exist (despite infamous traffic!) Other cities can also
strengthen their entrepreneur peer-support networks, the panelists
summed up.

Annual AXA survey shows small businesses no longer focus on competitors'

AXA Startup Report 2023 identifies key opportunities for growth for SME
owners. Capitalising on new sales channels replaces closure of
competitors as one of the top opportunities. Clients returning as
economy stabilises and new products and services seen as key
opportunities.

Original Press Release:

June 1 -- AXAissued the following news release:

- The AXA Startup Report has identified the key opportunities for growth
that SME owners think are most important in 2023

- Capitalising on new sales channels has replaced the closure of
competitors as one of the top opportunities

- The AXA Startup Angel competition supports new businesses with two top
prizes of 25k startup funding - entries close on Sunday 4 June

Small business owners are no longer judging their own opportunities for
growth by the demise of their competitors, according to the AXA Startup
Report 2023. The annual poll of 500 SME owners found many are instead
relying on diversifying revenue streams through new sales channels as
something to capitalise on.

Increased consumer awareness about the benefits of using small
businesses and realising cost savings, such as reducing fixed costs such
as rent, are also among the top 13 opportunities identified for 2023.

In comparison to 2022's list of opportunities as voted by SME owners,
introducing new technology to improve business efficiency is down, while
expanding into new locations and opening branches have gone up. Net Zero
carbon emissions is also seen as an opportunity for business, which did
not register among SME owners in 2022.

Challenges provide opportunities, but it's not always easy to capitalise
on them. The last few years have been amongst the toughest for small
businesses due to the Covid pandemic so we're doing our best to support
and encourage those who have just set out on their journey. The AXA
Startup Angel competition, which closes on Sunday, will provide an
invaluable boost to a selection of small British startups." Deepak Soni,
Director of SME Business Insurance at AXA UK Deepak Soni, Director of
SME Business Insurance at AXA UK

- Deepak Soni, Director of SME Business Insurance at AXA UK

The 2023 report found SME owners are less worried about weak demand for
their products domestically than they were 12 months ago. Encouragingly,
more than half (58 percent) said they had reached their main business
goal since starting out. For 22 percent, the core driver was to simply
be their own boss, while 14 percent wanted to improve their work/life
balance.

The latest results of the 2023 report are being revealed as the closing
date for this year's AXA Startup Angel competition approaches. As 2023
continues, the key opportunity British SME owners see appearing is
clients returning as the economy stabilises (21 percent). A fifth are
looking forward to introducing new products and services, and 19 percent
expect to see an uptick in domestic clients. But while closure of
competitors was a big opportunity for 20 percent in 2022, this year that
number drops to just 12 percent, according to the study carried out via
OnePoll.

Small business owners seem less concerned about benefitting from the
demise of competitors, focusing instead on launching new products and
services and reaping the benefits of clients returning to the market. We
look forward to seeing how things may change in 2024's report, hopefully
putting Covid and other recent challenges further in the rear-view
mirror. Deepak Soni

AXA UK launched the AXA Startup Angel competition in 2021 to help
startup businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs better seize the
opportunities for success. This year AXA is offering two top prizes of
25,000 investment into the winners' businesses, invaluable mentorship
from some of Britain's best entrepreneurs, and business insurance for 12
months thanks to AXA. A further four businesses will each win a 10k
digital marketing campaign.

Tips for Living a Sober Life

Congratulations! You've recently completed a recovery program for drug
or alcohol abuse. Admission is the first step to recovery. Now that
treatment is over it's time to return to everyday life - a healthier,
sober life. But this transition isn't always easy. As they say, old
habits die hard. There are several things you can do to support your new
sober lifestyle. This article covers some tips and tricks for supporting
your recovery process and putting you on the right path to success.

Never Consider the Recovery Process "Over"

One of the biggest mistakes recovering addicts make is to think that
following rehab, the recovery process is over. Addicts will forever
battle with addiction. Attending rehab, detoxing, and gathering the
tools needed for success is the first step in the recovery process. But
sober living means continuing to fight temptations, keep a positive
mindframe, and eliminate negative thoughts, behaviors, and people from
your life. This isn't always easy but it's necessary for adopting a
healthy, sober life. All too often, the minute a recovering addict lets
their guard down is when dependency creeps back in. Although the
recovery process doesn't need to be in the forefront of your mind at all
times, it's something addicts should always be aware of.

Surround Yourself with Positivity

One of the hardest things for recovering addicts to do is eliminate
negative people and influences from their lives. After all, these people
are their friends. Unfortunately, if these friends are still struggling
with addiction or participating in risky, destructive behaviors, it's
only a matter of time before the addict falls back into bad habits. You
may need to separate yourself from your old circle of friends and branch
out. Surround yourself with positive, sober, and healthy influences.
Many times recovering addicts discover bonds and friendships in rehab or
in other support groups. Here's a guide to a sober dating life. Anyone
you bring into your new, sober life should respect and support your
journey.

Avoid Temptation and Triggers

Rehab teaches addicts about their triggers. Every type of addiction,
from drugs to alcohol to even sex addictions, are triggered by
something. Understanding your triggers is crucial for sobriety.
Rehabilitation helps addicts understand what their triggers are and how
to avoid them. Temptation is also a concern following rehab. The first
few weeks following treatment is when addicts are at the greatest risk
for relapse. Ease into sober life by spending time with family,
counselors, at work, or alone - whatever it takes to avoid temptation
and strengthen your resolve.

Continue Using Resources

Just because rehab is over and you're no longer living in a facility
doesn't mean you can't utilize support and resources. Most in-patient
treatment programs offer contact information and resources for
recovering addicts to use following discharge. Don't be afraid to pick
up the phone and reach out to a counselor or another sober friend.
Attend AA (alcoholics annonymous) meetings or other support groups that
offer encouragement and advice for your daily struggles. Literature and
journaling are two more resources recovering addicts can utilize.

Set New, Attainable Goals

Adopting a sober lifestyle means setting realistic and attainable goals.
There's no sense in setting yourself up for failure. Start small and
praise your accomplishments. These goals can be something as small as
going out to dinner with friends and not ordering a drink to keeping
your weekly appointments with your therapist. The road to recovery can
be a difficult one. When you set realistic goals and crush them, it
boosts your confidence and solidifies the belief that you can and will
overcome your addiction. Now's the time to set new goals, as well. Go
after that job you've always wanted, return to school, or start a new
exercise routine. Anything that makes you feel good, strong, and
focused.

Living a sober life is both rewarding and possible, even for those
battling years of addiction. Entering rehab is the first step. But
continuing to make positive choices following rehab is often an addict's
greatest challenge. Surrounding yourself with positive people and
understanding your own triggers will set you on the path to success.

Dateline: SVB collapse

Body

SVB collapse, March 13 -- After the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis,
global equity markets and US dollar are under stress. In last three
sessions, US dollar rate has retraced from three month highs as Dollar
Index has slipped from around 106 levels to around 103 levels while key
benchmark indices in Wall Street lost up to 2 per cent on Friday
session. However, gold rates today climbed to the tune of $1,880 per
ounce levels, logging around $65 per ounce spike since Thursday lows of
around $1,815 levels. After failing to sustain above 4 per cent yield,
US bond yield has once again started to appreciate.

According to investment experts, this SVB collapse followed by Signature
Bank closure, bond yield, especially in treasuries are going to hit
badly. However, this is restricted to US bond market only, for Indian
treasuries, which is regulated by Reserve Bank of India, this crisis
won't have any impact. For, mutual fund investors, those Indians
investing in international and international hybrid funds will be
affected by the recent SVB and Signature Bank collapse.

Likewise, in forex market, those who have position in dollar may have to
face the beating as US dollar has retraced from 3-month highs in last
three days by a larger extent. Dollar Index is current quoting 103.523,
which was quoting close to 106 levels on Thursday. but, the biggest hit
of this banking crisis in the US would be IPO and US equity market. They
said that banks that have reported collapse in last three days were
major lenders for the US-based startups. So, after the failure of these
banks, IPO market is expected to nosedive in near term whereas equity
market would be under enormous stress in the US.

On how this SVB crisis would impact equity market across globe, Kartik
Jhaveri, Director - Wealth at Transcend Consultants said, "SVB and
Signature Bank used to led startups and after the collapse of SVB and
Signature Bank, cash flow for startups will remain challenged in the US
for near term. This will have bad impact on US IPO market as startups
planning to go for listing may postpone their public issue till the
actual picture arrives."

Asked about SVB crisis impact on the mutual fund market, Kartik Jhaveri
said, "Debt funds won't have much impact, neither in the US nor in
India. However, for Indian mutual fund investors who have exposure in
international mutual funds and international hybrid mutual funds, this
news is not a good news. For the mutual fund investors in US, their
equity mutual fund return for short term would be impacted but for
medium to long term investors, it is wait and watch situation."

"The SVB collapse has out uncertainty about the banking system in the
US. Hence, both US economy and the US currency is expected to face
investors' ire in near term. So, US dollar rates are expected to remain
under pressure till some concrete road map is announced from the US
administration," said Anuj Gupta, Vice President - Research at IIFL
Securities.

On how bond market investors would be affected by this banking crisis,
Manikaran Singhal, Founder at goodmoneying.com said, "Indian bond
investors need not to worry about this banking crisis in the US. But,
for the US bond investors, those who deal in treasuries will be
negatively impacted by this crisis. So, those who deal in the US
treasuries, are advised to take a pause for near one week and assess the
US bond market on how this ban king crisis pangs out in next one week."

news is not a good news. For the mutual fund investors in US, their
equity mutual fund return for short term would be impacted but for
medium to long term investors, it is wait and watch situation."

"The SVB collapse has out uncertainty about the banking system in the
US. Hence, both US economy and the US currency is expected to face
investors' ire in near term. So, US dollar rates are expected to remain
under pressure till some concrete road map is announced from the US
administration," said Anuj Gupta, Vice President - Research at IIFL
Securities.

On how bond market investors would be affected by this banking crisis,
Manikaran Singhal, Founder at goodmoneying.com said, "Indian bond
investors need not to worry about this banking crisis in the US. But,
for the US bond investors, those who deal in treasuries will be
negatively impacted by this crisis. So, those who deal in the US
treasuries, are advised to take a pause for near one week and assess the
US bond market on how this ban king crisis pangs out in next one week."

As the media partner for DesignUp 2022 conference this week, YourStory
presents speaker insights on data storytelling, product analytics, and
startup tips.

Rasagy Sharma is an information designer, data artist, and sketchnoter.
He is currently product designer at Sundial. A graduate of NID and BITS
Pilani, he is also an Adjunct Assistant Professor at IDC, IIT Bombay.

Rasagy is speaking at the DesignUp 2022 conference in Bengaluru on
September 17-18. As media partner, see YourStory's earlier coverage of
DesignUp conferences and sessions from 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

For a decade, Rasagy has worked at the intersection of data and design.
Earlier, he was the Principal Information Designer at Gramener, where he
applied data storytelling to business problems. He also creates art
using data and code, and supports design communities.

See also YourStory's Book Review section with takeaways from over 340
titles, and our d-Zen ('Design Zen') section for more design resources.

Rasagy joins us in this interview on data storytelling, learning from
failure, community involvement, startup tips, and the impact of design.

Edited excerpts below:

YourStory (YS): In a world of increasing information overload, how can
data storytelling come to the rescue?

Rasagy Sharma (RS): Data storytelling applies data representation
practices, places it in the reader's context, and focuses on driving
action.

My favorite example of this has been the visualisation of Gun Deaths in
US by Periscopic. This piece does justice to individual stories, along
with showing several insights from this polarizing topic.

In the pandemic, I found the use of the phrase "flatten the curve" a
great example of how data storytelling takes a complex behavior and
simplifies it for everyone. I've also found Reuters consistently create
stellar data stories, and their COVID dashboard had several excellent
examples of this, from generating key insights on the top to mapping how
different countries are going through/past a peak in cases.

YS: That's quite a creative streak you have-from product metrics to data
storytelling! How did that come about?

RS: Thanks, this happened quite serendipitously! I went to BITS to
become a programmer, found myself designing data visualisation by
chance, and decided to stick with it as I transitioned roles.

My first full-time role-as the first designer at Capillary-introduced me
to the idea of dashboards, and inspired me to pursue a Masters in
Information and Interface Design at NID. Since then, I've worked on
designing products where representing data was crucial, at organisations
like Microsoft, Barclays, Mapbox, and Gramener.

Recently, building Sundial helped me get a deeper understanding of
product analytics. I finally find myself connecting the two aspects of
blending data and design: using data to drive design decisions (product
analytics) as well as representing data and narrating insights (data
storytelling).

YS: What are your thoughts on the trends of productisation of services
and the 'as-a-service' model for products (eg. SaaS)?

RS: I find the SaaS model valuable for both customers and product
builders. This has helped open up the market to smaller, niche products
that solve a specific problem (and have lower/pay-as-you-use pricing)
instead of paying one-time large upfront fees.

For folks building these products, it has made it easier to build
something small, get enough adoption, and continuously deliver
improvements to customers that was much harder earlier.

We can see this by following the overall trend moving away from
ownership of products (car, albums cassettes, movie DVDs) to models that
allow you on-demand access to these (ride hailing, music and movie
streaming).

YS: What have been some of your experiences with failure and mistakes?
How does a creative person learn, cope, and move on?

RS: I've been grateful that NID instilled an internal voice for
self-critique, along with teaching us to separate the critique of the
work from the individual. I've gradually learned to acknowledge our
messy reality where design and designers play only a tiny role, and
there are several moving parts that lead to the success or failure of a
project/product.

So as a creative professional, I've constantly tried to take a step back
once a project is done, let it grow or fail, and reflect on what I can
do better the next time. I've enjoyed working on many projects that
never saw the light of day, and I also often look back in dismay at all
the gaps in my old work.

Having a select group of peers who keep you grounded, give you honest
critique, and help you see the big picture has been essential for me to
stay sane as a designer.

YS: Many of our readers are tech startups. What is your advice to them
on when they should start seriously integrating UX in their journeys?

RS: Short answer: the sooner, the better! At Sundial, along with having
Julie Zhuo as a designer and co-founder, we've had a strong design team
from the start.

This has been crucial in making the whole company value good design,
think deeply through problems, and always keep customers at the heart of
what we're building.

I've also seen startups with designers in early stages get deeper
insights on the biggest pain points to solve (through just enough user
research), as well as receive early feedback on the product direction
(without fully building the product). This can be a great differentiator
in a crowded market.

YS: Is there a particular age when people are most creative, or can the
creative bug strike you at any time?

RS: In my opinion, there is no "golden age" to be creative, but people
often feel kids are more creative because they are neither constrained
by reality, nor fear judgment from others.

I personally believe creativity to be a skill that can be practiced and
honed, and I don't subscribe to thinking of it as a talent or trait that
only some are born with. The more you practice (lateral or divergent
thinking, exposing yourself to new ideas), the easier it is for
creativity to 'strike' you!

YS: How did the pandemic affect your work and other activities? How did
you cope?

RS: The pandemic shook me and my partner quite a bit. Culturally, we
don't talk about death, grieving, and the impermanence of life, so the
early part of the pandemic was spent being extremely anxious, constantly
dealing with an existential crisis, and struggling to be present for our
loved ones.

Initially, I contributed in whatever way possible: at Gramener, we
worked closely with state governments and helped them analyse infection
spread and testing infrastructure. I also helped with small tasks like
creating multi-lingual myth-buster posters for government medical
institutions.

Later in the pandemic, I collaborated with Project Fuel to map stories
of hope and wisdom from around the world. During the second wave,
DesignUp for a Cause helped raise Rs 70 lakh by doing a virtual
conference, and I volunteered for planning and facilitation.

The pandemic brought a lot of things into perspective, and I loved
Gandalf's quote from LoTR: All we have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given us.

YS: Seeing urban pollution, drought, and flooding these days, what are
your thoughts on redesigning habitats and lifestyles?

RS: I understand very little of how urban cities are-or aren't-designed,
so I don't have deeper insights on this.

In general, I don't think such problems have easy solutions (especially
not anything just tech or design can solve), and we need a system
thinking approach along with a good understanding of incentives for
different stakeholders to bring change. I hope to spend more time
listening and understanding before I can form thoughts on what can be
done next.

YS: What new projects and activities are you involved in these days?

RS: Most of my time is spent on design explorations and a few fun
experiments at Sundial. Outside of work, I'm excited about running
unconferences for DesignUp this year, teaching data visualisation and
design at NID and IDC IIT Bombay, and helping a small creative coding
community (CC Sante!) host monthly meetup.

YS: What are five must-read books about UX, design and ethics that our
audience should have?

RS: Broadly, How Design Makes the World by Scott Berkun and Ruined by
Design by Mike Monteiro are two great books for every designer to read
(and get a balanced perspective).

Specific to information design, I highly recommend Storytelling with
Data by Cole Knaflic, and Resonate by Nancy Duarte for great, practical
advice on visualisation and storytelling.

And Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, both for understanding
how hope sustains in the darkest of times, and for his work on
logotherapy and finding a purpose in life.

YS: How can industry and academia work together to increase 'design
quotient' in society? What are some of your activities in this regard?

RS: As the boundaries of academia blur through cohorts, influencers and
several formal institutes talking about design, I think there is an
abundance of introductory information to consume.

What's missing is more spaces (conferences, meetups, publications) for
those in the industry to share, and a long-term view for growing design
maturity in the society. My efforts are currently limited to teaching at
a few design institutes and speaking at a few conferences, but I hope to
find more ways to get others excited about data and design.

YS: If you were to write a book now, what would it be about?

RS: It would be a compilation of how designers in different fields use
data in their design process. It's interesting to see how a data
journalist, dashboard designer, and product designer use data in very
different ways in their work.

YS: What is your parting message to aspiring entrepreneurs, writers, and
designers in our audience?

RS: I hope to see more folks take interest in understanding design, and
would love to read more thoughtful articles, critiques, and reflections
on how design is transforming in India!

Highlight: STUDIES SAY SOCIETAL PERCEPTION, FEAR OF FAILURE THE BIGGEST
ROADBLOCKS

Body

STARTUP & INNOVATION

The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report for India point at the
rise of new women entrepreneurs – out of total registered ventures, it
was 6.4% in 2013 which rose to 8.7% in 2018-19.

Dr Sunil Shukla, director of EDII and lead author of the report for
India, said that entrepreneurship as perceived opportunity for women has
increased from 32% in 2013 to 44.4% in 2018-19. “Women believed that
successful entrepreneurs have high status in society. On the other hand,
fear of failure was found to be a significant entry barrier,” he said.

A study yet to be published by IIM-Ahmedabad's CIIE.CO pointed at 10%
women entrepreneurs in India compared to 36% in the US. Supriya Sharma,
partner, Insights, CIIE.CO, who co-authored the report, said that for
many women, it's a process from denying to defying. “Entrepreneurs often
try to balance claims to legitimacy (factors such as male validation,
marriage and education) and challenging norms,” she said.

A computer engineer from Ahmedabad, Nidhi worked for a city-based
education venture before going to Harvard University and pursuing
technology, innovation and education (TIE). “I found the scope in
training college youths for interviews and also training them for higher
education exams such as CAT,” she said. Nidhi said that her decision to
branch out as an edupreneur was supported by her family – full of
chartered accountants – with her idea of pedagogy. Her venture is
incubated at CIIE.CO at IIMAhmedabad. “The interplay of factors such as
societal biases, one's own expectations and governance structure create
issues for women entrepreneurs. Women's representation should not be
tokenism – it should be the way for her to realize her own potential,”
she said.

After a master's course in microbiology and medical lab technology,
Gurnani worked as a senior research associate with a pharma giant in
Ahmedabad before deciding to venture out in uncharted territory –
promoting vegan vitamin D. “About 80% of the population is deficit in
the vitamin and if one is a vegetarian, there are fewer options.

Thus, we developed a technology so that the vitamin can be incorporated
into staple food such as roti, curry and salad for fast distribution,”
she said. She mentions that the pressure for success is there. “We have
to prove ourselves time and again – if a man's venture fails, people
would attribute it to business risk but in women's cases, 'we told you
so' is the common response," said Gurnani.

A chance meeting with Prof Anil Gupta propelled Nikita, a B.Tech from
NIT Raipur, to develop a technological solution for farmers of India.
Thus, her flagship product 'Smart Sensor for Hydrology & Land
Application' took shape which got validated by ISRO. Winner of multiple
awards, the venture is incubated at EDII. “My family wanted me to become
an IAS officer. But they backed my decision to start my venture,” she
said. “Often, when we go for business meets or interact with farmers,
they don't talk to me directly, thinking that I might not be acquainted
with the technical aspects," said Nikita.

Ujjain: Absence of basic amenities; Parshvanath City residents seek FIR
against UMC officials, builders

Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh): No water or electricity to combat the searing
heat and a lack of cleanliness all-around has made life miserable for
the residents of Parshvanath City, and their anger boiled over on
Monday.

The residents of the most posh colony of the city, who are battling
these problems daily gheraoed the Nagjhiri police station and demanded
registration of a case against the Ujjain Municipal Corporation
officials along with the builders.

The colony, developed about 12 years ago at the wounded-up IISCO Pipe
Factory premises on Dewas Road, was counted among the best colonies of
the city till a few years ago. The reason for this was the claims made
by the developer about a covered campus, 24 hours electricity, water,
wide roads, parks, community halls, shopping complexes, schools and
clubs.

The elite class of the city bought into this dream following which 1100
plots of the colony were sold out. In 2014, as soon as the building
permission was granted, people started building houses and in just one
year 300 families made these into their homes.

As the houses were built, problems started cropping up in the colony
which started with electricity. The coloniser had promised to build a
separate sub-station, but he went back on his promise as soon as the
plot went on sale. Due to this, instances of power failure in the colony
started to crop up. Added to this the problem of water also started.
People gathered resources at their level and carried on the work, but
their anger erupted when the electricity disruptions started getting
longer and longer. The residents knocked on every door to get basic
amenities but the problem was not solved. They had previously
demonstrated at the collector's office and also blocked Dewas Road but
to no avail.

Thus the residents, troubled by the daily problems, gheraoed the
Nagjhiri police station on Monday and after raising slogans, made an
application that an FIR be registered against the builders and the then
corporation officers. Manish Sharma, president of Parshvanath City
Residents Association, said that we went everywhere but we were not
heard anywhere. When the government provides basic facilities in poor
settlements, why can't the facilities be available in our colony?
According to Sharma, not a single promise made by the builders was
fulfilled. No water is available. There is no electricity. There is no
sewerage plant. There will not be any place where we have not
complained. But till now no solution has been found, he added.

Police station-in-charge Vikram Singh Ivne said that residents have
submitted a complaint and they are investigating it and necessary action
will be taken after the investigation.

India aborts rocket lift-off at 11th hour

Post (South Africa)

July 17, 2019 Wednesday

THE non-building of sufficient pressure in the helium tanks in the
Bahubali rocket could be the reason for calling off the moon landing
mission Chandrayaan-2 an hour before its take off, say retired officials
of the Indian spaceorganisation.

If successful, India would have been the fourth country after the US,
Russia and China to perform a "soft" landing on the moon.

The rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV-Mk
III), was supposed to lift off at 2.51am on Monday with India's second
moon mission spacecraft Chandrayaan-2.

"A technical snag was observed in the launch vehicle system one hour
before the launch," the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro)
tweeted. "As a measure of abundant precaution, the #Chandrayaan2 launch
has been called off... the revised launch date will be announced later."

The retired Isro officials said there should be proper pressure in the
liquid fuel tanks, so there was continuous flow of fuel to the
combustion chamber.

"While the fuel is fed into the combustion chamber from the bottom,
helium gas is filled from the top. It seems sufficient pressure was not
being built up," said an official. He said the flow of fuel to the
combustion chamber should be uniform for the rocket to fly.

In 2006, the GSLV-F02 (different variant of GSLV) went out of control
less than a minute after lift-off and had to be destroyed in the air
after it started breaking up.

In its failure analysis report, an expert committee said a propellant
regulator in one of the four strap-on liquid motors had a higher
discharge coefficient in its closed condition.

"The reason for this could be an inadvertent error in manufacturing,
which escaped the subsequent inspection, and acceptance test procedures.
This regulator has functioned satisfactorily in all the previous 50
engines manufactured and tested so far," the report said.

"The primary cause for the failure was the sudden loss of thrust in one
out of the four liquid propellant strap-on stages (S4) immediately after
lift-off at 0.2 seconds. With only three strap-on stages working, there
was significant reduction in the control capability.

"However, the vehicle attitude could be controlled till about 50
seconds. At the same time, the vehicle reached the transonic regime of
flight and the vehicle attitude errors built up to large values,
resulting in aerodynamic loads exceeding the design limits thus leading
to break up of the vehicle."

The thrust of the liquid engines used in the strap-on stages was
precisely controlled by a set of regulators.

"Detailed analyses have indicated that in S4 engine the thrust control
was not effective. Instead of stabilising at 5.85 MPa (mega pascal)
chamber pressure, it reached 7.11 MPa at 2.8 seconds. This was much
beyond the design limits and the engine failed at 0.2 seconds after
lift-off, that is 5 seconds after its ignition.

"The larger flow of propellant led to higher operating pressure in the
gas generator (4.7 MPa against design specification of 3.6 MPa). Due to
this higher operating pressure of the gas generator, the water flow rate
into it got reduced. The combined effect of larger flow of propellants
and reduced flow of water led to a very high gas temperature of 1.823 K
against design specification of 900 K and pressure of 4.7 MPa against
the design specification of 3.6 MPa.

"The very high operating pressure and temperature resulted in the
structural failure of the gas generator. The consequent abrupt stopping
of the turbo pumps that feed propellants at very high pressures to the
engines led to loss of thrust of S4 engine."

Isro had ruled out any sabotage theories and said the quality checks and
inspections had been strengthened.

The first flight of GSLV slated for March 28, 2001, was aborted with the
automatic shutdown of the main engine seconds before the lift-off. That
too after the four liquid propulsion strap-on boosters started burning.

The automatic shut off system was activated when it sensed that one of
the strap-on boosters did not develop the required thrust.

The rocket was flown on January 18, 2001, carrying the GSAT-1 satellite.

Why you need to get a founders' agreement in place for your startup

Got yourself a great business idea?

Let me start with the bad news first. It's going to be a very bumpy
ride; only 10 percent of the business survives the first five years.
Competition is rarely the reason for a startup failure; their infant
death is attributed to weak management, indecisiveness, and mistrust
amongst the founders.

Startups are not meant to be one-person rides. You need people by your
side. Someone whom you can trust for skills, commitment, and
persistence. A good startup team would consist of more than one founder
with complementing skill-sets and domain expertise.

Before rushing to getting your product off the ground, you need to lay a
solid foundation. It includes thinking through the problems you face,
events of changing expectations, possible conflicts, etc.

It's okay to start with a mutual understanding but it is advisable to
document it in the form of a 'founder agreement' as soon as possible.

What is a founders' agreement?

A founder's agreement is a legal contract between the founders that
defines roles, responsibility, shares of equity, exit options, etc. It
is designed to protect each member's interests and to prevent future
conflicts. A founders' agreement helps you by

* Defining the role and expectations from each founding members

* Defining a structure to resolve potential conflicts

* Defining a process of exit or adding new members

* Protecting minority stakeholders

* Paving ways for future investment and growth

Basic elements of a founders' agreement

Personal details -

This includes details of the founders, their roles, and
responsibilities. Other details include the name of the company and
registered office.

Equity breakdown -

Equity is the most expensive asset for a company. The equal division is
not a mandate but it should be in proportion to what the other person is
bringing to the table - domain expertise, money, efforts, resources,
etc.

Decision-making powers -

A few tough decisions are the mandate for running a startup. How do you
plan to take such hard calls? Is it better to have one person with the
power to decide? How do you check and balance? It's a tough call between
one person having unchecked power as against having a decision paralysis
at a crucial time. Decisions would range from bringing investments,
vesting equities, adding new people to the core team, termination and
pivoting, etc. You can have a clear division of areas and ownership for
business development, marketing, product development, etc. The person
who is owning a domain can have more power in that area, but a clear
decision-making structure should be defined as critical decisions
related to future growth and hard times.

Vesting schedule

The vesting schedule is equally crucial. What if one of the founders
becomes lenient after getting the equity. What if one of you wants to
leave after a year or two? Does the leaving member keep his/her shares
or have to surrender? In the event of a surrender, how do the remaining
members distribute those shares? What if you have to add a new member to
the team? The founder's agreement should clearly define the vesting
schedule to avoid future conflicts. This becomes even more critical when
you raise funding from outside. You should also have a documented
understanding of how and under what conditions these agreed-upon vesting
terms can be modified.

IP ownership

If you are working in a high-tech domain, it's possible that one of the
founders had a major role in developing that product. He/she has all the
right to be attached to their innovation, but any IPR should be owned by
the company and not by an individual. The innovator can be rewarded with
higher equity if required but once you form an entity, everything is
owned by the entity and not by an individual. This helps you protect the
organisation when an individual decides to break away. He/she should not
claim a right over the product or develop a similar prototype with
someone else.

Confidentiality and non-compete clause

As a founder, you are expected to have access to confidential
information. The core team should trust each other. What if one of the
founders decides to leave and share the critical confidential
information with one of your competitors? Your agreement should have a
binding time for any parting member. The parting members should not join
competition, start a similar business, break away suppliers, vendors,
employees, or clients.

Remuneration and compensation

How do you plan to compensate each other for the time and effort? How do
you define the remuneration? Is it based on needs or contribution?

Disputes and resolution

Conflicts, disputes, and disagreements are a part of startup life.
Maturity lies in thinking ahead through the scenario, and agreeing and
documenting a framework/process to resolve such a conflict.

Exit and winding up

One of you might have to leave for some unforeseen reasons. The exit
clause should also cover the process of handling underperforming
members. What if you need to wind up? How do you share the liabilities,
profits or assets?

How to get started

By now you have a clear understanding of what entails a founders'
agreement and its importance.

Once you have filled in the basic details, it is time for some hard talk
between the founding members. Discuss and iron out a few things like
equity, vesting schedule, roles and responsibilities, winding and exit
clauses, etc. You can have a series of meetings to come up with
agreeable terms. The outcome of such a process should be all founders
agreeing on the minutest details. It's not advised to leave even the
smallest difference of opinion for a later discussion.

Once you have detailed out the basic agreement between founders. You may
opt for the services of a competent startup lawyer who can give you a
legal form to your understanding.

If there are some differences that you are unable to sort out, you can
involve someone whom you mutually trust. They can be your professor,
mentor, or any professional expert hired for such advice. If possible,
get a fellow entrepreneur who has already been through such an
experience to offer some insights.

Once the agreement is finalised, each founder should get a registered
copy of the agreement for their future reference.

No agreement can define your mutual trust and respect for each other.
Startups are tough bumpy rides and there would be a lot of hiccups. In
case you are unable to trust each other at this moment, this is the
right time to part ways. But once you commit to something, it's your
obligation to give 100 percent, not just for the interest of each other,
but for all stakeholders who trusted your vision.

India, Sept. 14 -- A true online shop supplies an interactive buying
cart icon within the header, a branded checkout process, premade product
galleries, and lots of other eCommerce-specific tools.

Yes, it is possible to take your current blog and add a number of
products. But in case your target would be to make an optimized online
retailer, a devoted WooCommerce theme is very best.

What to look for inside a WooCommerce theme

While some functions discussed can be accomplished with plugins and
WooCommerce extensions, our target is to find a WooCommerce theme that
minimizes the use of plugins. This way you don't have to mess with as
lots of moving parts.

No-brainer characteristics? Not so fast.

This could get you to assume that there's no purpose to test
responsiveness or a number of the following capabilities:

Compatability with all browsers

Blogging

Not all responsive designs are produced equal, though. And whenever you
do not test responsiveness, you set your self up for failure in the
start. Mobile commerce is around the rise, with mobile eCommerce
escalating every year.

A lot of theme developers also claim items like compatibility with all
browsers, exceptional design support, along with a attractive blog.

Having those options is very important. But it is the execution that
matters.

Now, let's get into several of the extra precise attributes which you
need to look for.

An interactive buying cart icon

Whenever you visit a well-known online store, it typically has an
interactive purchasing cart icon within the header, which tells you how
quite a few things you might have, in addition to the value.

Some WooCommerce themes take it towards the next level, with animated
Add to Purchasing Cart buttons that pop up once you scroll more than a
featured product image.

This buying cart region acts as a reminder for shoppers and also a quick
approach to finish the buying process.

A branded and customizable buying cart and checkout

By default, a standard shopping cart and checkout process is supplied by
means of the WooCommerce plugin, but you will have to dig in to the code
to customize it. One way around that may be to obtain a WooCommerce
theme together with the checkout and buying cart currently made for you.

A well-designed checkout experience, along with timely cart abandonment
emails, can help you cut down the cart abandonment concern that affects
all eCommerce retailers.

Moreover to generating to get a far better purchasing experience, this
also provides you an benefit over platforms like Shopify that have
somewhat bland buying carts which might be not branded to your shop.

Premade page templates

Every online store requires pages apart from category and product pages.

Gorgeous product pages based on ideal practices

The product web page is where prospects make decisions to purchase. For
that reason, it's necessary to inform the whole story behind every
single item.

The ideal product pages deliver assistance for spectacular imagery,
videos, and also downloadable documents. Whenever you learn concerning
the very best practices behind a product image gallery you begin to find
out the importance of zooming, navigation, fullscreen effects, and much
more.

Product reviews

Product reviews are packaged into WooCommerce, so your key goal is
always to find a theme with a good quality product review design.

May 01 -- CBI Insights' grim sounding 2020 report entitled 339 Startup
Failure Post-Mortems found that 70% of upstart tech companies fail. When
it comes to consumer hardware startups, 97% eventually die or "become
zombies." And what were the top three reasons for startup failure?

-   No market need 

4.  Ran out of cash 

4.  Not the right team (lack of diversity in skills and experience)

Harry had Dumbledore, Luke had Yoda, and Daniel had Mr. Miyagi. While
your startup may not be facing an imminent attack by death eaters,
stormtroopers, or teenage ninjas, having the right mentor in your corner
can seriously help when it comes to developing the right features,
battling competitors, winning a crucial funding round, and learning new
tricks along the way. 

To find out just how to identify and attract the right mentors, we spoke
with the manager of a startup accelerator, two startup founders, two
networking organizations, and one mentor. 

1. Find someone who can help you put the nail before the hammerEd Gaze,
has been Senior Manager of Lloyd's Lab, an accelerator for InsurTech
startups created by insurance giant Lloyd's, since its start in 2018.
Having seen hundreds of startups go through the program, one mistake he
commonly sees is:

"Sometimes startups come with a hammer and want to find a nail. They'll
develop a tool first and then try to find a problem to solve with it,
rather than starting with a problem."

This fundamental disconnect between startups and their customer base can
lead to major product-market fit issues down the line.

The beauty of the startup-mentor relationship is that mentors can help
you get into the mindset of your target audience. The ability to put
your product into the hands of a potential client (and not just any
client) and get their direct feedback can be the most valuable info
you'll ever get. 

Michael Crawford, CEO of Describe Data, experienced this first hand
during his time at Lloyd's Lab. "We used our mentors as a product-market
fit test group. We asked them what they thought about new business
ideas, what they liked, how they would like to be sold to, how much they
would pay, what licensing models they preferred, even down to UI
preferences. They were just incredibly helpful," he explained.

Start by taking a deep look into your ideal customer base. Develop
customer personas and make sure your potential mentor fits within this
category or has a deep understanding of what these personas would be
looking for, based on their experience.

2. The right connections can bring more than just cash flowIf your
startup is in great need of funding, even a killer pitch deck won't be
as effective at convincing investors as a personal recommendation from a
well-connected mentor. Having an external stamp of approval can bring
you a long way in gaining both funding and larger clients. But you
should consider if that's really what your startup needs right now.

Today access to data is gold for most startups. "The second biggest
value startups gain is when mentors either help provide data or
introduce the product to various people within their organization to run
a proof of concept," Ed explained.

Well-connected mentors can also be extremely helpful in connecting you
to mentors in other fields, whether you're in need of strategic growth
marketing hacks or want to introduce an IoT component to your product.
According to Ed:

The mentor doesn't necessarily have to have all the answers, provided
they've got the network within their business to find them. The ideal
mentor can also be someone who's just very good at influencing others to
get involved.

3. Get you out of your comfort zoneYou may find you really hit it off
with a mentor that has the same experience, a similar mindset, and
technical background. But selecting someone who will think the same way
you do may not be what's best for your startup. 

Allyson Kapin, Founder of Women in Tech, a nonprofit which showcases
women-led ventures and helps provide capital, mentoring, and direct
access to leading investors, explained, "It's important to look for
someone who can be supportive but can also provide constructive
feedback. A mentor should challenge assumptions when they feel their
mentees are headed down the wrong path and be able to have those tough
conversations." While praise can be highly motivating, finding someone
who can and will tell you what you could be doing better is invaluable.
"This can be life-changing for mentees," Kapin said. 

Gerard de Vere, COO of Describe Data, explained that, when starting out,
"most startups sit somewhere on a Venn diagram between being more tech
or industry heavy, depending on the expertise of its founders. The first
thing to do is to understand what your balance is between tech and
industry. Then try and find the opposite to fit the last piece into the
jigsaw puzzle."

His co-founder Michael agreed: "Push yourself out of your comfort zone.
We were kind of adopted by an external marketing mentor and an
enterprise sales expert during the Lloyds lab. These were two areas we
didn't have any real experience in. Those relationships months later are
still strong and they've been incredibly invaluable for us. Look for
people outside your area of expertise because they'll be highly critical
and highly useful."

Attracting your ideal mentorOnce you've found the Yoda to your Luke
Skywalker, how do you convince them you're the right mentee to take on?
(Aside from carrying them through the jungle on your back of course.)

Tip one: Show your enthusiasm"To attract interesting mentors, it's about
passion. Michael does a lot of presenting for us and he's very
passionate and very charismatic. That's very honest and authentic and
really attracts people. We've seen a really great technical startup that
had the talent and the skills, and, if they had gotten funding, they
would have gone really far. But the guy just didn't have any charisma.
At the end of the day, it's not just the idea, the team, or the need
that mentors will consider," Gerard explained. Just like anyone else,
they want to spend time on something they're excited about.

Tip two: Drop the technical jargonEven if your solution and what it does
may seem obvious to you, it might not be to other people. Ed once saw a
startup use very technical language during a midpoint review. After the
founders left the room, he asked the mentors if they had any further
feedback. That's when a few admitted they honestly didn't understand
what the solution was. Always remember to translate your technical
language into words your mentors will understand.

Rob McLendon, a mentor for Lloyd's Lab, works as a Principal for Beat
Capital. With a background in the insurance world, his interest in
mentoring comes from a drive to learn about advancements in tech and how
they can help him and his company in their day-to-day.

"The first thing I'll consider is the practicality and the tangibility
of the service or product. In the InsurTech space, there are a lot of
things that are difficult to comprehend. When that happens, the
practicality aspect disappears. For me, that skips over one of the
problems that the insurance industry has: just doing the simple things
really well," Rob told TNW. 

Tip three: Set realistic goals upfront with your mentorHaving worked
with numerous female-led startups, for Allyson Kapin, the best way to
get the most out of your relationship with your mentor is to set clear
expectations and deliverables from the start:

What are the top short term things you want to work with your mentor on?
What are the top three long term goals? Define how you will work
together on these goals. Will you meet virtually once a month to discuss
your progress and challenges? Will the mentee check in once a week via
email on how they are doing with their mini-goals and tasks? Define all
of this upfront so you set expectations from the start.

Tip four: Build long term relationshipsLeslie Feinzaig, CEO of Female
Founders Alliance, knows all too well about the difficulty of attracting
mentors and investors when you're just starting out. Having started her
own EdTech startup, she soon realized she didn't have the same founding
experience and support that male CEOs in her industry had. In 2017, she
founded the Alliance to enable female entrepreneurs to connect, share
tips, and help each other develop the skills they needed to create and
scale a successful startup. She suggests:

Build your network before you need it. Look for opportunities to truly
connect with people that you admire or have kinship with professionally.
Ask them for coffee, share opportunities, and stay in touch,
professionally. Those are the relationships that over time yield the
best mentorship and the best introductions.

Look at it as a two-way streetDon't be afraid to approach a potential
mentor. Keep in mind that, for mentors, especially when coming from a
corporate background, the speed at which decisions can be made, and the
ability to directly influence the development of a new product can bring
the rush that makes mentoring worth it. 

You could see this sense of excitement when Rob talked about one of the
startups he mentored, Inari: "They helped us build a cutting edge data
lake that brings together tons of data points to give us this
enterprise-wide view of our business. I've just never been part of
something like that. I learned a lot and we did it on time specification
and on budget, which, to build a data lake, is almost unheard of."

Airlift, Pakistan's top startup, shutting down following funding crunch

July 15 -- Airlift, Pakistan's top startup, is shutting down in a move
that has sent shock waves to the nascent but fast-growing ecosystem in
the South Asian market.

The Lahore-headquartered startup told employees Tuesday evening that it
will be permanently ceasing operations on Wednesday, according to two
sources and slides presented to them.

The move comes after Airlift unsuccessfully attempted to put together a
new financing round, deliberations of which continued as recently as
last week, said one of the company slides, obtained by TechCrunch.

 

"Multiple" investors told Airlift that it will take them over two months
to wire the money, the startup told employees. "Other investors [were]
unwilling to assume the risk of wiring ahead of others," the slide said.

Airlift operated a quick commerce service in eight Pakistani cities,
including Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. Users could order groceries,
fresh produce and other essential items, including medicines, from the
Airlift website or eponymous app and have it delivered to them in 30
minutes.

Instant commerce as a category has made inroads worldwide in recent
years, but they also tend to be some of the most capex heavy businesses.

The startup raised $85 million in the country's largest Series B funding
round in August at a valuation of $275 million, the highest for any
Pakistani startup. Harry Stebbings of 20VC and Josh Buckley of Buckley
Ventures led that round. Airlift is also the most funded startup in
Pakistan.

 

Airlift was attempting to raise a new round earlier this year via SAFE
at a $500 million valuation, according to a source with direct knowledge
of the event.

 

Update: Airlift founder Usman Gul confirmed to TechCrunch that the
startup is shutting down and provided detailed notes about the events of
recent months.

The startup's demise could hurt the local ecosystem's enthusiasm. In the
past three years, scores of global investors, including Tiger Global,
Prosus Ventures and Addition, have backed young startups in Pakistan,
giving a major vote of confidence to the market.

"We were never their investors, but I'm still sad for the people losing
their jobs and who will be justifiably jaded by what just went down,"
tweeted Kalsoom Lakhani, GP at i2i Ventures, an early-stage focused
venture firm in Pakistan.

"I'm also worried that this will reflect poorly on Pakistan's entire
startup ecosystem, which is unfair to the MANY startups building well
right now, growing without compromising their biz fundamentals. Failure
in any startup ecosystem isn't anomaly; it's inevitable. The more we
leave room for failure, the more we also create room for successes in
their wake."

 

Airlift was widely seen as the poster child of the Pakistan's startup
ecosystem. Pakistan's then Prime Minister Imran Khan publicly
congratulated the startup when it unveiled its Series B funding news.

"As a pioneering technology startup in Pakistan that had established a
new precedent, Airlift's success was viewed as a milestone for a
burgeoning technology ecosystem in emerging markets. We believe that the
ecosystem will continue to thrive and that some of the most valuable
technology companies in emerging markets are still yet to be started,"
Gul wrote in a letter to staff Tuesday.

 

 

Airlift says it will provide severance payments to employees in the next
four to eight weeks and clear dues to suppliers and stakeholders.

"Teammates are not required to come to work beyond today - access revoke
will run by end-of-day Thursday, followed by communication via personal
emails," the startup said in another slide, obtained by TechCrunch.

 

Earlier this year, Airlift began expanding to South Africa, a move that
significantly increased its expenses, a person familiar with the matter
said. In a note to staff in May this year, obtained by TechCrunch, Gul
warned that the market conditions had suddenly taken a turn for the
worse as tech stocks reversed most of the gains following a 13-year bull
run.

Airlift needed to be "extremely judicious in how capital is deployed and
managed" and was halting any new hires, Gul wrote at the time. He said
the startup's expansion to South Africa will "remain in a nascent stage
in FY 2022."

In the note Tuesday, Gul said Airlift was able to achieve order-level
profitability, maintain reasonable scale and reduce financial burn by
66%. "As of July, 2022, Airlift was about three months away from
operating profitability (i.e. positive cash flow from operations), and
about 6-9 months from company-level profitability (i.e. Free Cash
Flow)," he wrote.

It was also finalizing a new funding round when suddenly things well
apart.

 

"With the above developments in May, one of our investors stepped up to
lead Airlift's Series C1 financing. We've received tremendous support
from the potential lead in opening doors to other investors to put
together the round. First Round Capital, Indus Valley Capital, Buckley
Ventures, 20VC and other investors agreed to participate in the round
with sizable checks," Gul wrote.

"In early July, Airlift had a clear path forward to close the round -
the company pushed out documents for signatures to all participating
investors."

"Last week, amidst rapidly deteriorating conditions in the global
economy, several participants shared uncertainty in wire schedules and
their disbursements - this ultimately meant that the company's capital
requirements would not be met. Ultimately, the round was unsuccessful,"
he added.

Prototypes, failures, innovation: test your business creativity with
Edition 24 of our quiz!

This insightful feature from YourStory tests and strengthens your
business acumen! Here are 5 questions to kick off this 24th quiz. Ready?

This weekly quiz from YourStory tests your domain knowledge, business
acumen, and lateral thinking skills (see the previous edition here). In
this 24th edition of the quiz, we present issues tackled by real-life
entrepreneurs in their startup journeys.

What would you do if you were in their shoes? At the end of the quiz,
you will find out what the entrepreneurs themselves actually did. Would
you do things differently?

Check out YourStory's Book Review section as well, with takeaways from
over 330 titles on creativity and entrepreneurship, and our weekend
PhotoSparks section on creativity in the arts.

Q1: Agritech startups

Much has been written about startups that disrupt their ecosystem and
remove intermediaries from the value flows. However, some startups have
actually succeeded by including intermediaries, as in the case of travel
booking startup redBus. How might this play out in a sector like
agriculture?

Q2: Investor strategies

Good investors provide more than just funding. They invest "smart
capital," which includes domain and management expertise, industry
connections, and assistance in recruiting talent. What else should
investors be helping founders with?

Q3: The talent edge

A key role of leaders is to build the next rung of excellence by hiring
the right talent. They should be paid well, and connected to those who
drive business scale. But there is something else that leaders should
do - what is that?

Q4: Failure lessons

Popular startup mantras include fail fast and fail cheaply. Failure
lessons should be captured and shared for all. That may sound easy, and
is actually quite tough. But there is one more problem with the way
mistakes are viewed as compared to success. What is this cultural
misperception?

Q5: Prototypes of products and services

Approaches like lean startup and design thinking place a strong emphasis
on first understanding the problem as well as the customer's journey and
aspirations. Prototyping leads to the final solution, in an iterative
manner. But innovators often get stuck at the early phase of
prototyping - why is that?

Answers!

Congratulations on having come this far! But there's more to come -
answers to these five questions (below), as well as links to articles
with more details on the entrepreneurs' solutions. Happy reading, happy
learning - and happy creating!

A1: Agritech startups

"The [farming] problem is so complex and market so fragmented that you
need the support of the existing ecosystem. One cannot go in and just
try to disrupt the existing ecosystem and be a replacement for it,"
explains Nukul Upadhye, Co-founder of Bijak.

The B2B marketplace for agricultural commodities claims monthly
transactions worth over Rs 300 crore, across 28 states. Rather than
challenge the status quo and disintermediating the middleman, the
startup has worked with them also. Read more about going beyond purely
transactional relationships in this ecosystem here.

A2: Investor strategies

"Founder time is the most precious commodity in our world, and we want
to be very respectful of that so we can provide teams with as much
forward momentum as possible," explains Nilesh Balakrishnan, Associate
Vice President, WaterBridge Ventures.

Engaging with VCs is often a daunting and long-drawn process. "We hope
to bring more transparency and decisiveness to the decision-making
process," he adds. Read more about their FastForward programme's
portfolio of nine startups here.

A3: The talent edge

"When you think about growing people, it's not about how you get them
promoted, it's about helping them discover their strengths and investing
in their growth, and that'll help them succeed in any company," advises
Sonia Parandekar, Head of Engineering for Commerce at Atlassian.

Business leaders in positions of influence should strive to be
multipliers. "Sometimes [women] want to progress but need a little
guidance and encouragement. It's so rewarding to know that you can play
a role in someone's growth," she adds. Read more about leadership
responsibilities here.

A4: Failure lessons

"Mistakes help us see things differently. However, we have to see
mistakes differently first," explains Prashant Desai, author of the book
The Biography of a Failed Venture. It documents the ups and downs of his
journey in founding sports brand D:FY, and its eventual demise.

"While stories of success attract, those of failures are expunged," he
laments. Denial and blame games are often the response strategy. "We are
mistaken about what it means to make a mistake," adds. Read more about
his valuable learnings from failure here.

A5: Prototypes of products and services

"Never fall in love with your prototype," explain authors Michael
Lewrick, Patrick Link and Larry Leifer, in their insightful Design
Thinking Playbook. After immersion in customer journeys and interviewing
them, the next phase in design thinking is prototyping.

The prototype should allow users the ability to experience and evaluate
the offering. "Prototypes are assumptions that must be scrutinised," the
authors affirm. A simple prototype will entail less hurt when it has to
be rejected, and not being unduly attached to early prototypes helps
move on to the real solution. Find more product and service tips here.
