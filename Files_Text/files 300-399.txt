Founder factories: Alumni from 344 European and Israeli unicorns have
birthed 1,018 startups since 2008

Body

A new report has shone a light on the impact that European and Israeli
unicorns have had on the broader technology ecosystem since the global
economic crisis 14 years ago. The report, titled Europe and Israel's
Startup Founder Factories, was produced by VC firm Accel with heavy
support from startup and VC data platform Dealroom. It reveals that of
the 344 VC-backed unicorns since 2008, nearly two-thirds (203) have led
to at least one startup being founded by former employees, with 1,018
tech startups emerging in total. Founded back in 2005, French adtech
giant Criteo leads the pack with its alumni going on to create 29
so-called "second generation" startups. This is followed by Spotify
(27), Delivery Hero (27), N26 (24), Klarna (23), Revolut (23), Skype
(21), BlaBlaCar (21), Zalando (20), and Wise (19). While many of the
names on there such as Spotify or Skype are long-established founder
factories, what's perhaps more notable are that of the more recent
entrants to the unicorn brigade, such as Glovo and Wefox, are already
leading to a whole bunch of new startups.

Indeed, a plurality of the unicorns covered in the report only hit
unicorn status since 2019. This latest report comes as companies from
across the industrial spectrum have faced a frosty reckoning with
reality this year due to the global economic downturn: valuations at
pretty much all stages are down. However, with the sheer number of tech
workers that have been laid of this year, from big tech giants such as
Meta and Twitter, to growth-stage startups in just about every vertical,
this could create a fertile landscape for a swathe of new startups to
emerge. And that, perhaps, is why Accel is producing this report now -
it wants to show that some good can come from tough times. Indeed, the
timescale of this report is particularly notable, as its data starts at
the time of the last major financial crisis - a point in time that also
signalled a major transformation in the technology industry, with
smartphones just emerging into the mainstream arena. In the intervening
years, countless technology companies have sprung up, some catapulting
toward world domination, some disappearing into oblivion, and some
falling somewhere in the middle. But irrespective of how events
transpired, it all served to produce a lot of people with experience of
building and scaling complex tech-infused startups. Even failure isn't
necessarily a bad thing. "While founders and their teams are navigating
a tough macroeconomic environment, it's also true that the community is
in a much stronger position than during the 2008/9 financial crisis,"
Accel partner Harry Nelis said in a statement. "There's now a wealth of
strong founders and operators building innovative companies that have
experienced the start-up journey before and have the knowledge to create
global success stories." It seems that this trend isn't lost on unicorns
themselves. Just last week, Spanish delivery company Glovo, which was
acquired by Delivery Hero back in January and which has laid off a
number of employees this year, announced a new program called Glovo
House, designed specifically to support Glovo alumni founders via
mentorship, networking, and support for raising money. For the purpose
of Accel and Dealroom's report, the term "unicorn" describes any
VC-backed company that achieved a valuation of $1 billion or more while
it was a private company, though it excludes pharmaceutical or biotech
companies. And "startup" refers to any technology company that was
founded by someone formerly employed by a unicorn on a full-time basis
for at least five months, and who started their new company within six
years of leaving the unicorn. Digging into the data does reveal some
potential flaws, insofar as less than half (44%) of the
second-generation startups have confirmed raising more than $1 million
in funding. While venture capital funding isn't the only bellwether of
what constitutes a successful startup launch, it's certainly a strong
indicator - thus, it's difficult to know how many of the startups gained
any meaningful traction. Indeed, when pushed on the data, Accel said
that just 48% of the startups had revealed raising $100,000 or more.
However, it caveated this by noting that 54% of the startups had only
been founded since 2020, meaning that many of them are still very
early-stage and either haven't raised any outside funding yet, or have
yet to announce it. Digging even deeper into the numbers reveals some
other notable nuggets. Delivery Hero, for example, has birthed Flink,
Gorillas, and Jokr, while Skype led to Wise, Bolt, and Pipedrive - each
of these companies have gone on to hit unicorn status themselves. Also,
there is at least one third-generation unicorn out there. Israel-founded
payments company Payoneer has spawned some 12 startups, one of which is
IronSource which recently merged with Unity in a $4.4 billion deal. And
it was IronSource employees who launched Noname Security, which hit a $1
billion valuation last December just a year after it was founded out of
Israel. In total, there are 23 examples of unicorns birthing unicorns,
though not all of those secondary unicorns are necessarily based in
Europe themselves. The report did state, though, that 56% of
second-generation companies were founded in the same city as the
original unicorn. On top of all that, with layoffs and scalebacks rife,
it's not clear whether all these companies' respective valuations are
still at a "unicorn" level today - some of these valuation needles may
spin backwards in a future funding round. The report also delved into
founder factories by city, with the data suggesting that London remains
a bedrock in the European technology sphere - the U.K. capital is top of
the list in terms of overall number of startups spawned by unicorns.
Indeed, 27 unicorns founded out of London created 168 startups over the
past 14 years, 69% of which are also based in the city. Berlin was
second with 24 local unicorns creating 138 startups, 70% of which were
founded in the German capital. Rounding out the top five were Paris (125
startups from 22 unicorns) Tel Aviv (108 startups from 27 unicorns), and
Stockholm (98 startups from 11 unicorns). However, it can be difficult
pinning a startup to a specific region, as companies may move their
headquarters to the U.S. early on to secure funding or be closer to
customers. GitLab, whose former VP of Product launched Remote which
recently hit a $3 billion valuation, is perhaps a good example of this -
while its foundations are certainly rooted in Europe, the company is
formally incorporated in the U.S. with a fully distributed workforce
spread across dozens of markets globally. Similarly, Payoneer has been
headquartered in New York almost since its inception. The report did
note that the location of the companies in the dataset was based on
where they were initially created, irrespective of where they may have
later relocated to. Put simply, in a world of remote work and founders
with itchy feet, it's perhaps not as easy to pigeonhole a startup as
"European" or "Israeli" in 2022 as it was 14 years ago. But despite all
those grey areas, Dealroom's data still gives some interesting insights
into founder factories and the flow of technology talent over the past
14 years.

June 06 -- In the cutthroat world of startups, failure is an all too
familiar companion. However, amidst these daunting odds, there are
remarkable entrepreneurs who have defied the statistics and transformed
their unsuccessful ventures into stepping stones towards triumph. These
visionary individuals possess a unique mindset that sees failure as a
powerful teacher rather than a deterrent. Instead of being disheartened
by setbacks, they leverage them as invaluable learning experiences. They
adapt, refine their strategies, and bounce back stronger than
ever.Success is difficult to achieve, especially for company owners.
Many people have aspirations of starting their own business and making a
good living from it. There are around 58.5 million entrepreneurs in
India, which is the country of many well-known and well-regarded
businesspeople. 14% of such business owners are women. However, if you
look at the history of Indian entrepreneurs, you will see that many
well-known figures struggled before finding success. 

In this listicle, we present the top four entrepreneurs in the startup
world who have embraced their failures, leveraging them as metaphorical
stepping stones to reach greater heights in their entrepreneurial
journeys. 

Karmesh Gupta-WiJungle:-

At the age of 17 only he started his own startup- Http Cart Technologies
(Leading IT Product Company) in October 2014 along with his cousin
Praveen Gupta.

In April 2015, Http Cart became the first ever Indian private company to
launch Completely Free WiFi - "WiJungle" but This service did well
initially but shut down due to certain financial encounters. However,
after certain forays, the Guptas recognized the area of network security
and introduced 'Unified Network Security Gateway Product' under the old
brand name 'WiJungle' in April 2017. WiJungle is now a globally
acclaimed brand name as the 'world's first unified network security
product'. Now the startup built a profitable startup of 200 Cr.
and raised seed funding at a valuation of $22 million.  WiJungle was
introduced by Karmesh Gupta. With the use of this Gurugram-based network
security platform, businesses can enhance and safeguard every aspect of
their network through a single interface. The WiJungle is currently
serving the government and private businesses across various verticals
including hospitality, healthcare, education, defense, transportation,
retail, BFSI, and ITES, among others across pan India.

Karmesh Gupta

Sunil Bharti Mittal:

He started his first business, where he made crankshafts for bicycles
and was only 18-years old at that time. Within 3-years, he set up two
more plants, but his initial days were pretty tough as he earned very
little from it. By 1980, he established Bharti Overseas Trading Company
through which imported many portable electric power generators. But in
1983, the government banned the import of generators, which made Mr.
Mittal go out of business overnight. But that didn't stop him, as he
found success through the telecom business and started marketing fax
machines and telephones, which helped him become successful.

Sunil Bharti Mittal

Ritesh Agarwal:

Ritesh Agarwal is one of the most popular Indian entrepreneurs who
failed even before making it big. He started Oravel Stays which has
operated as a marketplace for bed and breakfast. But his company failed
to gain success because he didn't have the best team, which led to
plenty of arguments and mishaps within the firm. But he did not lose
hope and started again by building an excellent team. By 2013, Mr.
Agarwal changed the name of Oravel Stays to OYO Rooms to provide rooms
for a hassle-free stay within the economy and budget sector of the
Hospitality Industry of India. He has led his firm to 4000-rooms,
450-hotels, and over 500-employees along with 3-rounds of growth and
funding.

Ritesh Agarwal

N.R. Narayana Murthy:

Mr. N.R. Narayana Murthy is one of the well-known Indian entrepreneurs
who failed before achieving success. He started his journey from IIMA
and established a small startup firm known as Softronics. But the
business failed miserably, and he ended up joining Patni Computer
Systems. Mr. Murthy had a different dream, for which he established
another company with the name Infosys Technologies along with his six
other partners. Now, Infosys is one of the most highly successful IT
(Information Technology) firms across the globe.

Why every budding entrepreneur needs a mentorship programme

Mentorship programmes often act as enablers and provide the invisible
spell that transforms aspiring and budding entrepreneurs into
flourishing business moghuls.

One of the main reasons for the failure of startups is the lack of
experience and competency of new entrepreneurs. This manifests in the
lack of vision and the inability to find a profitable niche for their
businesses. While entrepreneurship may definitely be a lucrative career
path, it is rarely a walk in the park, and posits several turgid
challenges of its own.

Entrepreneurs are valorised for defying prevalent norms and internalised
inhibitions that hinder their expansion plans. Therefore, perhaps for
anyone concerned about increasing the probability of survival and
viability of a new business, these observations would suggest that
proper support in terms of skills-building and development or having a
mentor to guide entrepreneurs through the initial drudgery phase of the
start-up becomes of utmost importance.

As an aspiring business leader, you'd often find yourself in situations
where you might not know what to do next or how to revive your moxie
from a mistake that could cost you your entire business.

In times like these, an expert, a savvy guide, or perhaps a mentor can
help you chart an alternate strategy, help you pick yourself up and get
back in the game or even stop you from making fatal mistakes or actions
that warrant tremendous flak.

Simply put, challenges at every step are a part and parcel of
entrepreneurship and having a good mentor will always help you tide over
obstacles by turning bad decisions into good plans and will imbibe you
with the confidence to move relentlessly towards stipulated objectives.

Some of the factors that bog down budding entrepreneurs that often
compel them to forfeit their ventures are the following:

* Fear of failure

* Limited access to capital

* Weak institutional support

* Lack of experience to tackle problems

* Limited knowledge and information

Armed with the support of a good mentorship programme, budding
entrepreneurs can not only increase their entrepreneurial awareness but
can also gain access to correct variant of exposure, visibility and
talent that would further enhance their skills and improve their
entrepreneurial esprit de corps.

What is entrepreneurial mentoring?

Entrepreneurial mentoring involves a relatively experienced entrepreneur
acting as a sagacious 'critical friend' or 'guide', helping to oversee
the career and development of a novice entrepreneur who is inexperienced
when it comes to dabbling with various facets simultaneously.

Each party brings different perspectives and knowledge, and in many
cases, mentees will establish the goals of the relationship.

Entrepreneurial mentoring can be viewed as a business development
process for owners/managers. This is based on the premise that there is
a direct link between entrepreneurs' actions and capabilities and the
performance of their businesses.

In this context, entrepreneurial mentoring programmes focus on:

* The future of the mentee entrepreneur's personal skill-set development

* The mentee's professional development

* Supporting the mentee's firm by providing pertinent advice and sharing
similar experiences

* Increase the confidence of entrepreneurs gradually

* Teach them better human resource management and internal business
processes

* Provide them with broader networking avenues and platforms

Mentorship programmes often act as enablers and provide the invisible
spell that transforms aspiring and budding entrepreneurs into
flourishing business moghuls.

With mentors themselves often being entrepreneurs who have built their
empires through trials and tribulations, they have invaluable, coveted
and relevant insights to share. Having said that, here are few reasons
why budding entrepreneurs must undergo mentorship programmes:

* Mentorship is critical because it ingrains budding entrepreneurs with
the expertise to drive growth and success among business owners while
significantly contributing towards improving their performance.

* A good mentorship programme can amplify your chances of success in
life and in business alike. The valuable connections, timely advice,
occasional checks, and avuncular supervision * in tandem with the
spiritual and moral guidance you gain as a result of undergoing a
mentorship programme can help you gain a valuable jumpstart towards
success.

* With the support of a good mentorship programme, not only do you get a
boost of encouragement and confidence, but are also bombarded with
valuable guidance in areas such as business registration, marketing,
cost management and business networking, and a labyrinth of other
convoluted laws. The support of experienced professionals can help you
save time and money and keep the initial momentum

An entrepreneurial mentorship programme has the potential to instil and
infuse valuable expertise and exterity in entrepreneurs and their firms,
be it an upcoming startup or an established owner-managed business.

It can play an important part in the entrepreneurs' 'lifecycle', which
commences from the incipient stages of the startup and culminates when
the idea manifests into reality and reaches its peak value. On account
of the aforementioned traits, it is crucial that entrepreneurial
mentorship programmes gain widespread acceptance and adoption to boost
the potential of startups to withstand the ravages of time.

Unlocking the unicorn within: 6 attributes every startup's workforce
should have

Body

We have entered the era of startup unicorns that are redefining how
industries operate - but, like any business, these ventures are built by
strong, high-performing teams.

It won't be an overstatement to say that 2021 was the year of startups.
There were more entries to India's unicorn club than had existed until
that point; the number of Indian startups with a valuation of $1 billion
or more increased from 33 in 2020 to 77 by 2021.

These startups succeeded when, presumably, thousands of similar ventures
offering practically the same services and solutions at comparable price
points failed. Why? Once the most obvious answers - more funding, better
industry connections, higher user adoption - are exhausted, we are left
with, perhaps, the most accurate reason: the team.

This is a truism that any entrepreneur worth their salt knows: building
great teams is essential to building a great venture. However, what does
it take to be a unicorn and contribute towards creating a billion-dollar
business?

Here are six key attributes that a startup's workforce must have to
drive long-term success:

1. Execution obsession

The startup trajectory comprises three key components: idea, strategy,
and execution. Although having the right idea and strategy in place is
essential to get a new business venture off the ground, it is the
execution that can take a startup from one level to the next and set it
apart from its competitors.

The most successful Indian unicorns such as Paytm, OYO, and Ola are
prime examples of this approach. The business models and value
propositions of these unicorns were hardly unique in the market. What
differentiated them from the also-rans, however, was the pace, scale,
and efficiency with which they executed their ideas and strategies.

This is why startups looking for hypergrowth need employees obsessed
with execution. By tapping into their drive to get results, startups can
test ideas, business models, and strategies in the market, enabling them
to find the perfect growth formula faster than it otherwise would.

2. Specialism over generalism

When starting out, startups need multifunctional people who can do a bit
of everything. However, as the business grows, the need evolves from
all-weather generalists to specialists who bring expertise, precision,
and industry knowledge to the table.

Having these specialists on board can help startups in two main ways. To
begin with, they can identify gaps within existing processes and
workflows, as well as recommend best practices that can help startups
streamline and optimise execution capabilities. Their proven domain
track record also motivates teams to perform better and smarter. All of
these factors are essential to achieving the kind of growth that
aspiring unicorns target.

3. Resourcefulness

One of the non-negotiable attributes of a potential unicorn's workforce
is the ability to find creative solutions to business challenges by
assessing the situation, recognising possible interventions, and
selecting the most optimal course of action. This resourcefulness comes
in handy when a startup faces an unforeseen or disadvantageous situation
into an opportunity.

Zoho has done it regularly at Salesforce's Dreamforce conventions,
targeting the captive business audience at the event with guerilla
marketing techniques.

Peanut butter brand Justin's founder, Justin Gold, assembled his own
apparatus to manufacture the peanut butter recipe that multiple
factories said couldn't be done. It is no coincidence that such
resourcefulness has paid dividends for these startups; after all, where
there is a will, there will be a way.

4. Internal locus of control

When does a startup succeed in the market and deliver better results?
When it is aware of its strengths and capabilities and knows, in detail,
what it can do better and what it cannot do. This ability, as an
organisation, only develops when its employees possess an internal locus
of control.

People who have this trait often don't have to depend on instructions
from their seniors; they know their responsibilities, make their
decisions confidently, and value time.

In a 2018 report, it was observed that employees ranking high on
internal locus also tend to exhibit high levels of innovativeness - a
crucial trait for any startup to excel in today's ever-changing
marketplace. This sense of ownership in the workforce also creates an
environment where new ideas are explored, evaluated, and implemented all
the time.

5. Optimalist > Perfectionist

Businesses aspire to the idea of perfection: the "perfect" product, the
"perfect" marketing strategy, and the "perfect" workforce. This pursuit
of perfection, while useful to define aspirational goals, is also
illusory. No one thing or employee is perfect all of the time; there
usually is something or someone better in the market.

This is why, to achieve its dreams of becoming a unicorn, a start-up
must build a team of optimalists. Clear-eyed and focused, optimalists
accept reality as it is, not how they would like it to be, before
working on the most optimal way of achieving the closest approximation
of their perfect dreamscape.

This allows them an edge over perfectionists - who can often spend an
inordinate amount of time, energy, and resources for marginal gains - by
knowing when to move on from a project or idea. Startups with
optimalists in their ranks also learn better and faster from their
mistakes to hypercharge their growth trajectory.

6. Resilience

Startups dabble with risks that can deliver exponential returns, but
these risks don't always end in triumph - clients are lost; growth plans
backfire; products and business models fail to find market traction;
investors shy away from making financial commitments; or unforeseeable
crises, such as the pandemic, can make established plans and strategies
redundant. The ability to bounce back from such setbacks, adapt to them,
and learn how to do better is what differentiates a successful startup
from those that fail.

This resilience is also essential in the startup's workforce - from the
founding team down to the junior-most employee. It should come as a
surprise that some of the most successful startups were born of failure.

Odeo's failure led to the founding of Twitter while lessons from
SocialNet's inability to cut it in the market powered the rise of
LinkedIn - all because their workforce refused to give up on creating
something valuable.

If the data from the last few years are anything to go by, we have
entered the era of startup unicorns that are redefining how industries
operate - but, like any business, these ventures are built by strong,
high-performing teams. The attributes mentioned above are integral to
such teams, as they set about differentiating themselves in the market
and achieving stellar growth.

IT professionals condemn State govt's failure to renew lapsed Startup
Policy

Herald (Goa) (India)

November 13, 2020 Friday

PANJIM, Nov. 13 -- Goa Startup Policy 2017 expired on September 26,
2020. According to Startup Promotion Cell (SPC), 100 startups have been
certified in the last three years under the Goa Startup Policy 2017.
Each of these Startups employs about 6 to 15 people on an average. All
the startups who have taken benefits under the policy, their employees
and families dependent on them are facing the brunt of this policy
lapse. All the Startup Policy financial incentives are in the form of
grants and reimbursements, which are rolled back into the economy
through employee salaries, bill payments etc. All these indirect
beneficiaries are also being affected in the process, said Goa IT
Professionals (GITP) in a strongly-worded statement issued on Thursday.

Presently, eligible startups seeking promised benefits under the policy
are being presented with excuses galore. They are being told that SPC is
not processing any applications as they are awaiting policy extension.
It is further claimed that the finance department has taken away SPC
funds citing COVID emergency and is not releasing the required funds
amounting to less than Rs 3 crore despite follow-ups by SPC and IT
Minister.

IT professionals who have dared to take up the tough challenge of being
employment creators rather than employment seekers, with a hope that the
Startup Policy will provide some initial support during the teething
phases, have been left high and dry.

GITP lamented that when it comes to processing Startups requests,
complaints have surfaced time and again that the processing by the SPC
happens at a snail's pace.

The IT Department, which is expected to be a torchbearer of automation
and efficiency, and has a self-declared service-level agreement (SLA) of
45 days to review and approve or reject applications, has been taking up
to 6 months to do it even before and during COVID. It is understandable
that the process of initial registration-related verification of
Startups can take time due to manual interventions.

"But what stops the SPC from being punctual on, if not completely
automating the release of subsequent tranches of benefits and
incentives, asked the GITP members.

"At least in these taxing pandemic times when Startups are reeling under
extreme financial and work pressures, a proactive approach was expected.
But somehow no respite seems to be coming. It appears as though this
'lapse of Startup Policy' has become a convenient excuse for SPC to hide
its inefficiencies if not incompetence," said GITP added.

The further asked whether the SPC and IT department were unaware in
advance that the policy was expiring on September 26 and that the new
policy would be delayed? If it was not possible to release the benefits
without an active policy, why were interim measures not taken to extend
the policy time frame or take some other relevant mitigation measures?
Validity of several government documents, licences, registrations etc
related to transport, construction etc have been extended by the
government due to COVID. The same approach could have very well been
adopted in case of the Startup Policy renewal. Why was it not done?
asked GITP.

Goa Government which is 'over efficient' when it comes to granting
extensions to casinos, dot on the eve of the lapse of their permit,
licence, every six months, even during these pandemic times, seems to be
just indifferent to the lapse of the Startup Policy. Does this imply
that a handful of casinos who are into gambling activity are much more
valuable to the government as compared to hundreds of Startup firms who
are toiling hard to create a decent livelihood option for themselves and
hundreds of Goans here in Goa?, questioned GITP.

The release went on to mention that the government has even been prompt
enough to give a waiver to the Casino industry on the Rs. 277 crore
annual fees allowing it to be paid on a monthly basis instead. Is the
ongoing 'financial crunch' excuse of our government applicable only for
the Startups and not the Casino industry? Or is our government keen to
promote a culture of Casino gambling and affiliated sin industries in
Goa rather than the modern, progressive, innovation and merit driven
Startup and IT industries for our youth to have respectable livelihoods
in Goa? What is our government's priority?

GITP further asked whether "Atmanirbhar Bharat", "Swayampurna Goem",
"Startups are job creators". "Startups innovate", "Startups are
aspirations of youth" etc. just for sloganeering and juicy jargon tweets
for shallow publicity?

"Will the Goa Startup Policy 2020, which is supposedly taking a
consultative and participatory approach by taking all stakeholders on
board, arrive only after all the existing startups suffer irreparable
damage due to chronic apathy of the SPC and IT Department?," GITP asked
further.

"Our Goa government, IT department and SPC need to ponder on these
questions and get their act together on a war footing without any
further excuses, for the IT and Startup industry stakeholders and their
educated employees themselves are driven by time-bound performance -
making India a global IT powerhouse over the decades - and can clearly
see through these bluffs and lame excuse unlike the mass electorate,"
GITP added.

Infosys Founder Narayana Murthy warns entrepreneurs from making these
mistakes

Infosys Founder and former Chairman Narayana Murthy's first startup,
Softronics, was a failure.

Infosys Founder and former Chairman, NR Narayana Murthy, is in many ways
the original poster boy of the Indian startup ecosystem and Indian IT,
having built the Bengaluru-based IT bellwether from the ground up. So
when the man behind one of India's most fabled startups speaks about his
entrepreneurial journey, you lap up every piece of advice. Entrepreneurs
cannot have a 'Plan B', Mr Murthy told students of SVKM's NMIMS (a
deemed university).

"When you are running your enterprise, you cannot have a 'Plan B' and
you cannot be half-hearted about your idea. You have to give your best
as if there is no alternative at all. So, till you get a very clear
message from the market that your idea is not going to set sail, please
do not think of Plan B," Mr Murthy told students during the virtual
interaction.

The former Infosys chairman was responding to a query about his
beginnings as an entrepreneur with Softronics, his maiden
entrepreneurial venture, which he was forced to shut down. Founded in
the mid-70s, Softronics was a consulting firm offering computer
algorithms to Indian companies. The Indian market back then was not
ready for something like that yet and after seeing very little traction,
Mr Murthy was forced to shut down his first startup.

But he did not let the failure of his first venture deter him from
starting up again. After working at Patni Computers in Pune for around
five years, Mr Murthy founded Infosys along with Nandan Nilekani, NS
Raghavan, S Gopalakrishnan, SD Shibulal, K Dinesh and Ashok Arora, most
of whom he met at Patni. The rest, as they say, is history.

During the interaction with the students, Mr Murthy also highlighted
that the most common mistake an entrepreneur makes is not defining how
the startup's product or idea is adding value for the customer in a way
that is better than its competitors. He also stressed upon the fact that
as a country India can progress only if entrepreneurs create more
quality jobs with better salaries.

The 74-year-old doyen of Indian IT urged entrepreneurs and business
leaders to build an ecosystem where talent and hard work are not just
appreciated, but also acknowledged through real benefits.

"Leaders have to exercise self-restraint in apportioning the benefits
from a corporation disproportionately to themselves. In other words,
they should not take away the major part of the benefit that accrues
from their company. That leader should lead by example in values,
excellence, honesty, integrity, transparency, fairness, accountability,
openness to ideas, and meritocracy. They have to demonstrate
transparency and accountability in apportioning fruits of the hard work
of everybody in their company," he said.

Failure as a prologue to success

Apr 21, 2021( The Hindu Business Line:
http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ Delivered by Newstex) GM's EV1 and
the Tata Nano were commercial failures. But they spawned numerous
creative designs globally A new era is upon us when society, governments
and the auto industry all now seem convinced that the future of
automobiles belongs to electric vehicles (EVs).A technologist who is
familiar with Gartner's hype cycle of innovation will acknowledge that
this credence could have been bestowed only after a trial by fire, when
people behind the technology and related innovations would have
traversed the highs of showcasing revolutionary breakthroughs inevitably
followed by the lows of numerous failures in honing promising ideas into
practical use for society.In celebration of its 25th anniversary this
past week, several industry news feeds offered paeans to General Motors'
EV1 — the first saleable electric vehicle offered by a large automaker.
A milestone in the evolution of EVs and a true clean-sheet design, it
was a product that benefited from the considerable technical might that
the GM of 1990s possessed.Recognising that a fully-charged battery in
the EV1 contained the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline, every
attempt to improve mechanical efficiency was employed.

High efficiency three-phase AC induction motors, specially crafted
low-rolling resistance tyres, and a novel heat-pump in the place of a
conventional air-conditioning system were all innovations employed to
eke out a few more miles from that meagre store of energy.EV1, ahead of
its timeAs a young aerodynamicist at GM Research at the time, I recall
the effort taken to deliver a streamlined body with a drag coefficient
of 0.19 — a standard that still remains elusive to contemporary
products. A modern Tesla Model S, acclaimed as the world's most
aerodynamic car clocks in at 0.21. Sadly, as one more product that was
ahead of its time, GM scrapped the EV1 after less than 1,200 vehicles
were made. To many, this was another example of profligacy at GM.Any
retrospective look at the EV1 would do little more than massage bruised
egos if it failed to recognise the implications of the EV1 and its
impact on the subsequent evolution of EV technology. In reality, the
disbanded teams would resurface in many geographies and out of the ashes
of the EV1 deliver new products that would become part of modern EV
landscape.The propulsion team went on to Allison and became well
established suppliers to many EV bus fleets around the world. Heat-pumps
in the climate control systems are now more frequently employed in
modern EVs. Some of the motor and controller teams relocated to
California where their systems were embraced by Tesla. Tesla's chairman,
Elon Musk has often acknowledged the motivation that GM's sad decision
to scrap the pioneering EV1 provided for him personally.In India too, we
have witnessed a similar journey.Nano's journeyIn March 2009, when Ratan
Tata launched the Tata Nano, it was seen as a breakthrough product aimed
at serving the mobility needs of the common man at a previously
unmatched price. It gained for India credibility as a global source for
cost-innovation in engineering.Contrary to the notions of rustic
engineering associated with the epithet 'jugaad' , both the Tata Nano
and the Tata Ace were conceived with an engineering philosophy that
emphasised intelligent minimalism. Pursuit of minimalism was a goal that
motivated many of auto industry's great designers. Soichiro Honda's
mantra was 'man-maximum, machine-minimum'.Alec Issigonis designed the
iconic Mini which revolutionised small car packaging. And Dante
Giacosa's elegant engineering created post-war Italy's affordable
people's car — the Cinquecento. Their approach to design is best
described by Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of IKEA, who said, 'To design a
desk which may cost $1,000 is easy for a furniture designer, but to
design a functional and good desk which shall cost only $50 can only be
done by the very best.'Yet, like GM's EV1, Tata's Nano was also sadly a
commercial failure.Yet, from its ashes too numerous creative designs
have spawned and been applied globally. I recall a conversation with
Gordon Murray, one of Formula-1's prominent designers of that era. The
Nano, he averred, opened his eyes to a new angle of creativity.'I have
spent my career delighting in shaving tenths of kilograms off my
race-car designs. So, I can well imagine the exhilaration of
intelligently shaving tenths of dollars off the cost of a product'.
Murray then went on to develop a new range of innovative small cars that
could be produced with very low investment.The Indian elementMore
importantly, the erstwhile Chairman of the Renault-Nissan Alliance,
Carlos Ghosn, was a believer in the Nano philosophy. With his patronage,
the Renault-Nissan Alliance adopted the bold decision that their
entry-level global platform CMF-A would be developed not in Paris or
Tokyo as would have been normal, but in India.That this platform was
conceived in Chennai, with a healthy complement of ex-Tata staff from
the Nano project, and developed with a mostly Indian team is a ringing
endorsement of the talent and skills of Indian engineers in
cost-innovation.Apart from the Kwid that restored Renault's market share
in India, newer platform variants like the Nissan Magnite and the
Renault Kiger have lowered the entry price of Crossovers for many Indian
middle-class families. And now as Renault prepares to offer France's
lowest cost EV in that market, it will be the Dacia Spring — also built
off the Indian origin CMF-A platform.In a world now familiar with the
dynamics of start-ups, the term failure is not perceived as terminal
condemnation but rather as a description of a temporary state. After
all, the collective endeavours of motivated employees and entrepreneurs
can seldom result in outcomes that are useless. Failure, they say, is
not the opposite of success but rather an important component of
success.The poet Arthur Clough would say, 'Say not the Struggle nought
Availeth'The writer is Chairman of Celeris Technologies and the author
of 'Faster, Smarter, Greener: the future of the Car and Urban Mobility'

October 06 -- Telangana Government showcased 11 top Startups in
sustainability space to the global pool of 40,000 registered delegates
comprising entrepreneurs, startups and social entrepreneurs from 54
countries on day two of the TiE Sustainability Summit 2021.

 

The Principal Secretary of IT Jayesh Ranjan while speaking at the
inauguration the previous day said in the last 7 years since Telangana
was formed, the state has demonstrated in umpteen domains how
sustainability can be achieved. In continuation to that 11 startups were
made to present their companies to the global audience. 

Speaking on the occasion Shanta Thoutam from the IT Department said, in
2014 when the Telangana state was formed it just had 200 and odd
startups. Today there are more than 2000 startups. Telangana is the
start-up state of India. It has T-Hub, which pioneers India's leading
innovation ecosystem. It synergises startups, corporations, governments,
academia and investors to drive transformative change she informed. 

The state has 'WE-Hub', India's first state-led incubator exclusively
for women.

Though women entrepreneurs are on the rise, still women entrepreneurs in
India and across the world continue to have difficulties in Access to
capital & proper infrastructure; Appropriate industry connections.;
Affordable childcare; Balancing professional and personal life; Business
knowledge/basics;. Counselling and life coaching; Community to support
Women Entrepreneurs; Transportation and safety. We Hub bridges this gap,
she added. 

She spoke about IMAGE CoE, which is providing resources such as
mentoring, technology support and funding for Gaming, Animation, VFX,
Computer, etc.

T-Works is another initiative added to strengthen the ecosystem Shantha
said. It is India's largest prototyping centre in Hyderabad built to
create and celebrate a culture of hobbyists, makers and innovators who
explore and experiment without the fear of failure. 

She introduced start-ups in the Sustainability space which
include: Waste Ventures; Marut Drones, Ewoke Studio, Banyan Nation,
Coral Innovators, Eto Motors, Sanshodhan, an e-waste Exchange Pvt. Ltd;
D'CalHardwaterSoftner, Hala Mobility and Architude.

Roshan Miranda explained their junk to value journey. We collect waste
from your doorstep and pay you. We work with 6000 plus waste pickers. I
gave up my job in the USA and ventured into this as it keeps me happy,
he said. and added it gave him double happiness. The reason why we
started this was to divert the recyclable waste that was ending up in
landfills. We wanted to make people realise that there is a lot of value
in waste and with this thought, we started this venture.

Prem Kumar of Marut Drones explained his journey. A team of talented and
experienced individuals building end to end solutions to enable and
scale drone operations effectively he said. He explained how they used
drones to tackle the mosquito menace. It has helped achieve a huge drop
in the incidence of malaria and dengue cases. Though we got independence
75 years back we don't have freedom from the menace of mosquitoes. We
have identified it as the main pain point and built technological
solutions around it, he said. And added that their Marut Drones'
HepiCopters are being used for door delivery of medicine from the sky as
well as temperature-controlled vaccines. 

Now it's SeedCopter is spraying seeds from the sky in inaccessible
places deep inside the forests and hilly terrains. It hopes to plant 50
lakh seed balls this monsoon. 

Shruti Rawal of Ewoke studio is passionate about driving sustainability
in the apparel and textiles industry, and conscious consumption. 

Founder of Ewoke - A design label for sustainable fashion, she is an
alumnus of the National Institute of fashion technology. She started
Ewoke with a vision to empower women with the clothes they wear while
making a positive impact on society and the environment. Shruti shared
her journey. Being an eco-conscious person, I always thought about the
fashion industry which used to contribute 10% of global carbon
emissions.

I always thought of providing an alternative. That ultimately led to the
birth of Ewoke. I started Ewoke with a clear mission to curb climate
change. All our fabrics are biodegradable and recycled, with a minimal
carbon footprint like hemp. We source our trims from wood and shell. The
main reason behind this is to provide sustainable clothing which is the
new trend, she added.

We put sustainability into practice way back in 2013 says Rashi Agrawal,
Director at Banyan Nation. It is India's first vertically integrated
plastics recycling company that uses data intelligence to integrate a
largely informal supply chain. She gave an example of how Unilever was
making good progress towards a waste-free world. It significantly
stepped up its use of recycled plastic. And how few brands have been
using bottles made out of recycled plastics. Surf excel used 50% of its
bottles made from recycled plastic. 

Rashi left a good job in the USA to start this venture.

Water Warrior Kalpana Ramesh explained her journey and how she has been
impacting society. My dream is to see water tanker free homes. We should
have self-sufficiency in water. Kalpana Ramesh took over the Prime
Minister's Twitter handle on the eve of women's day in the past and gave
a call to the public to become water warriors.

Sikander Reddy Thandra of Coral Innovation explained that they have
built a mobile app-based platform making meter reading & billing simple
and foolproof for Utilities and Consumers. Our services help utilities
to eliminate the manual punching in meter reading and drastically reduce
the time taken for the monthly billing cycle at a much lower cost than
the presently incurred cost. Ours is an interesting self meter reading
app. It also gives insights into energy consumption, he explained.

Rajeev YSR, Vice President of Eto Motors said the most polluted cities
in the world are in India. We are India's no. 1 EMaaS (Electric Mobility
as a Service) company. We focus on the large-scale deployment of
multi-brand electric fleets for cleaner cities. We develop and deploy a
range of clean mobility services that are sustainable.

We are looking forward to revolutionizing the electric mobility story
not only in 100 key cities of India but also on the international roads.
We deploy electric vehicles all across the country and we own and
operate the fleet with an aim to better the livelihoods of drivers. With
Shared Mobility, we are already seeing a lot of people moving from
vehicle ownership model to vehicle access model, he added. He thanked
the Government of Telangana for creating an Ecosystem for Electronic
Vehicles.

Dr S. Shalini Sharma of Sanshodhan said that they enable corporates in
many cities and societies across Hyderabad to identify and directly
transfer their e-waste to government-authorised, technically competent
recyclers. India generates more than two million tonnes of e-waste
annually. It also imports a significant amount from developed countries.
You can get rid of old electronics sustainably in association with us,
she said.

Uday of D'Cal Hard Water Softner explained how their invention (device)
turns hard water soft for one-tenth the price. It is a hassle-free
process as the installation doesn't require any pipes, plumber or
electricity. All a user has to do is drop the bottle-shaped device in
the water tank. The product has received an overwhelming response and
they are exporting to the USA also.

Srikanth of HALA Mobility explained that it is India's first multi-modal
ride-sharing platform. Using the app, one can book a vehicle of choice
in 3 clicks. VijayadurgaKoppisetti founder of Architude said her
infra-tech startup leverages tech to provide green building solutions to
safeguard the environment. Climate change demands that the building
industry adopt greener and sustainable solutions, an architect
VijayadurgaKoppisetti explained. 

She said greener solutions are not only important to safeguard the
environment but also the health and wellbeing of the occupant. Every
year, four million deaths can be attributed to illness from household
air pollution, she added.

All the 11 startups in the sustainable space expressed their happiness
over the way the government of Telangana has been helping them by
creating conducive ecosystems for them to flourish.

The Government with an intent to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing
innovation, startups and encouraging private investments in startup
ecosystem of the country launched Startup India initiative on 16th
January 2016. As per eligibility conditions prescribed under G.S.R.
notification 127 (E) dated 19th February 2019, entities are recognised
as 'startups' under Startup India initiative by the Department for
Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Since the launch of
Startup India initiative in 2016, DPIIT has recognised 92,683 entities
as startups as on 28th February 2023. The number of startups recognised
in the country in the last five years is as under:     The regular
businesses are often measured by success or failure in a specific number
of years of operation, whereas, the startups and scale-ups (established
startups) are more accurately measured by failure or success in a
particular phase making it difficult to put together a statistic
covering all types of new businesses and their failure rate with any
level of accuracy. Therefore, the information with respect to the
success or failure of startups is not centrally maintained by the
Government.       Startup India initiative was launched on 16th January
2016 with an objective to build a strong eco-system for nurturing
innovation and startups in the country that would drive sustainable
economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities.

The details of various programs undertaken by the Government to promote
startups across the country under Startup India initiative are given
below. Programs Implemented under Startup India initiative The details
of various programs undertaken by the Government to promote startups
under Startup India initiative across the country are as under: Startup
India Action Plan: An Action Plan for Startup India was unveiled on 16th
January 2016. The Action Plan comprises of 19 action items spanning
across areas such as "Simplification and handholding", "Funding support
and incentives" and "Industry-academia partnership and incubation". The
Action Plan laid the foundation of Government support, schemes and
incentives envisaged to create a vibrant startup ecosystem in the
country. Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) Scheme: The Government has
established FFS with corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore, to meet the funding
needs of startups. DPIIT is the monitoring agency and Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) is the operating agency for FFS. The
total corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore is envisaged to be provided over the
14th and 15th Finance Commission cycles based on progress of the scheme
and availability of funds. It has not only made capital available for
startups at early stage, seed stage and growth stage but also played a
catalytic role in terms of facilitating raising of domestic capital,
reducing dependence on foreign capital and encouraging home grown and
new venture capital funds. Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS):
The Government has established the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups
for providing credit guarantees to loans extended to DPIIT recognized
startups by Scheduled Commercial Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies
(NBFCs) and Venture Debt Funds (VDFs) under SEBI registered Alternative
Investment Funds. CGSS is aimed at providing credit guarantee up to a
specified limit against loans extended by Member Institutions (MIs) to
finance eligible borrowers viz. DPIIT recognised startups. Regulatory
Reforms: Over 50 regulatory reforms have been undertaken by the
Government since 2016 to enhance ease of doing business, ease of raising
capital and reduce compliance burden for the startup ecosystem. Ease of
Procurement: To enable ease of procurement, Central Ministries/
Departments are directed to relax conditions of prior turnover and prior
experience in public procurement for all DPIIT recognised startups
subject to meeting quality and technical specifications. Further,
Government e-Marketplace (GeM) Startup Runway has been developed which
is a dedicated corner for startups to sell products and services
directly to the Government. Support for Intellectual Property
Protection: Startups are eligible for fast-tracked patent application
examination and disposal. The Government launched Start-ups Intellectual
Property Protection (SIPP) which facilitates the startups to file
applications for patents, designs and trademarks through registered
facilitators in appropriate IP offices by paying only the statutory
fees. Facilitators under this Scheme are responsible for providing
general advisory on diff­erent IPRs, and information on protecting and
promoting IPRs in other countries. The Government bears the entire fees
of the facilitators for any number of patents, trademark or designs, and
startups only bear the cost of the statutory fees payable. Startups are
provided with an 80% rebate in filing of patents and 50% rebate in
filling of trademark vis-a-vis other companies. Self-Certification under
Labour and Environmental laws: Startups are allowed to self-certify
their compliance under 9 Labour and 3 Environment laws for a period of 3
to 5 years from the date of incorporation. Income Tax Exemption for 3
years: Startups incorporated on or after 1st April 2016 can apply for
income tax exemption. The recognized startups that are granted an
Inter-Ministerial Board Certificate are exempted from income-tax for a
period of 3 consecutive years out of 10 years since incorporation.
International Market Access to Indian Startups: One of the key
objectives under the Startup India initiative is to help connect Indian
startup ecosystem to global startup ecosystems through various
engagement models. This has been done though international Government to
Government partnerships, participation in international forums and
hosting of global events. Startup India has launched bridges with over
15 countries that provides a soft-landing platform for startups from the
partner nations and aid in promoting cross collaboration. Faster Exit
for Startups: The Government has notified Startups as 'fast track firms'
enabling them to wind up operations within 90 days vis-a-vis 180 days
for other companies. Startup India Hub: The Government launched a
Startup India Online Hub on 19th June 2017 which is one of its kind
online platform for all stakeholders of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in
India to discover, connect and engage with each other. The Online Hub
hosts Startups, Investors, Funds, Mentors, Academic Institutions,
Incubators, Accelerators, Corporates, Government Bodies and more.
Exemption for the Purpose Of Clause (VII)(b) of Sub-section (2) of
Section 56 of the Act (2019): A DPIIT recognized startup is eligible for
exemption from the provisions of section 56(2)(viib) of the Income Tax
Act. Startup India Showcase: Startup India Showcase is an online
discovery platform for the most promising startups of the country chosen
through various programs for startups exhibited in a form of virtual
profiles. The startups showcased on the platform have distinctly emerged
as the best in their fields. These innovations span across various
cutting-edge sectors such as Fintech, EntrepriseTech, Social Impact,
HealthTech, EdTech, among others. These startups are solving critical
problems and have shown exceptional innovation in their respective
sectors. Ecosystem stakeholders have nurtured and supported these
startups, thereby validating their presence on this platform. National
Startup Advisory Council: The Government in January 2020 notified
constitution of the National Startup Advisory Council to advise the
Government on measures needed to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing
innovation and startups in the country to drive sustainable economic
growth and generate large scale employment opportunities. Besides the
ex-officio members, the council has a number of non-official members,
representing various stakeholders from the startup ecosystem. Startup
India: The Way Ahead: Startup India: The Way Ahead at 5 years
celebration of Startup India was unveiled on 16th January 2021 which
includes actionable plans for promotion of ease of doing business for
startups, greater role of technology in executing various reforms,
building capacities of stakeholders and enabling a digital Aatmanirbhar
Bharat. Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS): Easy availability of
capital is essential for entrepreneurs at the early stages of growth of
an enterprise. The capital required at this stage often presents a
make-or-break situation for startups with good business ideas. The
Scheme aims to provide financial assistance to startups for proof of
concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry and
commercialization. Rs. 945 crore has been sanctioned under the SISFS
Scheme for period of 4 years starting from 2021-22. National Startup
Awards (NSA): National Startup Awards is an initiative to recognize and
reward outstanding startups and ecosystem enablers that are building
innovative products or solutions and scalable enterprises, with high
potential of employment generation or wealth creation, demonstrating
measurable social impact. Handholding support is provided to all the

sustainability can be achieved. In continuation to that 11 startups were
made to present their companies to the global audience.

Speaking on the occasion Shanta Thoutam from the IT Department said, in
2014 when the Telangana state was formed it just had 200 and odd
startups. Today there are more than 2000 startups. Telangana is the
start-up state of India. It has T-Hub, which pioneers India's leading
innovation ecosystem. It synergises startups, corporations, governments,
academia and investors to drive transformative change she informed.

The state has 'WE-Hub', India's first state-led incubator exclusively
for women. Though women entrepreneurs are on the rise, still women
entrepreneurs in India and across the world continue to have
difficulties in Access to capital & proper infrastructure; Appropriate
industry connections.; Affordable childcare; Balancing professional and
personal life; Business knowledge/basics;. Counselling and life
coaching; Community to support Women Entrepreneurs; Transportation and
safety. We Hub bridges this gap, she added.

She spoke about IMAGE CoE, which is providing resources such as
mentoring, technology support and funding for Gaming, Animation, VFX,
Computer, etc.

T-Works is another initiative added to strengthen the ecosystem Shantha
said. It is India's largest prototyping centre in Hyderabad built to
create and celebrate a culture of hobbyists, makers and innovators who
explore and experiment without the fear of failure.

She introduced start-ups in the Sustainability space which include:Waste
Ventures; Marut Drones, Ewoke Studio, Banyan Nation, Coral Innovators,
Eto Motors, Sanshodhan, an e-waste Exchange Pvt. Ltd;
D'CalHardwaterSoftner, Hala Mobility and Architude.

Roshan Miranda explained their junk to value journey. We collect waste
from your doorstep and pay you. We work with 6000 plus waste pickers. I
gave up my job in the USA and ventured into this as it keeps me happy,
he said. and added it gave him double happiness. The reason why we
started this was to divert the recyclable waste that was ending up in
landfills. We wanted to make people realise that there is a lot of value
in waste and with this thought, we started this venture.

Prem Kumar of Marut Drones explained his journey. A team of talented and
experienced individuals building end to end solutions to enable and
scale drone operations effectively he said. He explained how they used
drones to tackle the mosquito menace. It has helped achieve a huge drop
in the incidence of malaria and dengue cases. Though we got independence
75 years back we don't have freedom from the menace of mosquitoes. We
have identified it as the main pain point and built technological
solutions around it, he said. And added that their Marut Drones'
HepiCopters are being used for door delivery of medicine from the sky as
well as temperature-controlled vaccines.

Now it's SeedCopter is spraying seeds from the sky in inaccessible
places deep inside the forests and hilly terrains.It hopes to plant 50
lakh seed balls this monsoon.

Shruti Rawal of Ewoke studio is passionate about driving sustainability
in the apparel and textiles industry, and conscious consumption.

Founder of Ewoke - A design label for sustainable fashion, she is an
alumnus of the National Institute of fashion technology. She started
Ewoke with a vision to empower women with the clothes they wear while
making a positive impact on society and the environment. Shruti shared
her journey. Being an eco-conscious person, I always thought about the
fashion industry which used to contribute 10% of global carbon
emissions.

I always thought of providing an alternative. That ultimately led to the
birth of Ewoke. I started Ewoke with a clear mission to curb climate
change. All our fabrics are biodegradable and recycled, with a minimal
carbon footprint like hemp. We source our trims from wood and shell. The
main reason behind this is to provide sustainable clothing which is the
new trend, she added.

We put sustainability into practice way back in 2013 says Rashi Agrawal,
Director at Banyan Nation. It is India's first vertically integrated
plastics recycling company that uses data intelligence to integrate a
largely informal supply chain. She gave an example of how Unilever was
making good progress towards a waste-free world. It significantly
stepped up its use of recycled plastic. And how few brands have been
using bottles made out of recycled plastics. Surf excel used 50% of its
bottles made from recycled plastic.

Rashi left a good job in the USA to start this venture.

Water Warrior Kalpana Ramesh explained her journey and how she has been
impacting society. My dream is to see water tanker free homes. We should
have self-sufficiency in water. Kalpana Ramesh took over the Prime
Minister's Twitter handle on the eve of women's day in the past and gave
a call to the public to become water warriors.

Sikander Reddy Thandra of Coral Innovation explained that they have
built a mobile app-based platform making meter reading & billing simple
and foolproof for Utilities and Consumers. Our services help utilities
to eliminate the manual punching in meter reading and drastically reduce
the time taken for the monthly billing cycle at a much lower cost than
the presently incurred cost. Ours is an interesting self meter reading
app. It also gives insights into energy consumption, he explained.

Rajeev YSR, Vice President of Eto Motors said the most polluted cities
in the world are in India. We are India's no. 1 EMaaS (Electric Mobility
as a Service) company. We focus on the large-scale deployment of
multi-brand electric fleets for cleaner cities. We develop and deploy a
range of clean mobility services that are sustainable.

We are looking forward to revolutionizing the electric mobility story
not only in 100 key cities of India but also on the international roads.
We deploy electric vehicles all across the country and we own and
operate the fleet with an aim to better the livelihoods of drivers. With
Shared Mobility, we are already seeing a lot of people moving from
vehicle ownership model to vehicle access model, he added. He thanked
the Government of Telangana for creating an Ecosystem for Electronic
Vehicles.

Dr S. Shalini Sharma of Sanshodhan said that they enable corporates in
many cities and societies across Hyderabad to identify and directly
transfer their e-waste to government-authorised, technically competent
recyclers. India generates more than two million tonnes of e-waste
annually. It also imports a significant amount from developed countries.
You can get rid of old electronics sustainably in association with us,
she said.

Uday of D'Cal Hard Water Softner explained how their invention (device)
turns hard water soft for one-tenth the price. It is a hassle-free
process as the installation doesn't require any pipes, plumber or
electricity. All a user has to do is drop the bottle-shaped device in
the water tank. The product has received an overwhelming response and
they are exporting to the USA also.

Srikanth of HALA Mobility explained that it is India's first multi-modal
ride-sharing platform. Using the app, one can book a vehicle of choice
in 3 clicks. VijayadurgaKoppisetti founder of Architude said her
infra-tech startup leverages tech to provide green building solutions to
safeguard the environment. Climate change demands that the building
industry adopt greener and sustainable solutions, an architect
VijayadurgaKoppisetti explained.

She said greener solutions are not only important to safeguard the
environment but also the health and wellbeing of the occupant. Every
year, four million deaths can be attributed to illness from household
air pollution, she added.

All the 11 startups in the sustainable space expressed their happiness
over the way the government of Telangana has been helping them by
creating conducive ecosystems for them to flourish.

The Government with an intent to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing
innovation, startups and encouraging private investments in startup
ecosystem of the country launched Startup India initiative on 16th
January 2016. As per eligibility conditions prescribed under G.S.R.
notification 127 (E) dated 19th February 2019, entities are recognised
as 'startups' under Startup India initiative by the Department for
Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Since the launch of
Startup India initiative in 2016, DPIIT has recognised 92,683 entities
as startups as on 28th February 2023. The number of startups recognised
in the country in the last five years is as under:     The regular
businesses are often measured by success or failure in a specific number
of years of operation, whereas, the startups and scale-ups (established
startups) are more accurately measured by failure or success in a
particular phase making it difficult to put together a statistic
covering all types of new businesses and their failure rate with any
level of accuracy. Therefore, the information with respect to the
success or failure of startups is not centrally maintained by the
Government.       Startup India initiative was launched on 16th January
2016 with an objective to build a strong eco-system for nurturing
innovation and startups in the country that would drive sustainable
economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities.

The details of various programs undertaken by the Government to promote
startups across the country under Startup India initiative are given
below. Programs Implemented under Startup India initiative The details
of various programs undertaken by the Government to promote startups
under Startup India initiative across the country are as under: Startup
India Action Plan: An Action Plan for Startup India was unveiled on 16th
January 2016. The Action Plan comprises of 19 action items spanning
across areas such as "Simplification and handholding", "Funding support
and incentives" and "Industry-academia partnership and incubation". The
Action Plan laid the foundation of Government support, schemes and
incentives envisaged to create a vibrant startup ecosystem in the
country. Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) Scheme: The Government has
established FFS with corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore, to meet the funding
needs of startups. DPIIT is the monitoring agency and Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) is the operating agency for FFS. The
total corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore is envisaged to be provided over the
14th and 15th Finance Commission cycles based on progress of the scheme
and availability of funds. It has not only made capital available for
startups at early stage, seed stage and growth stage but also played a
catalytic role in terms of facilitating raising of domestic capital,
reducing dependence on foreign capital and encouraging home grown and
new venture capital funds. Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS):
The Government has established the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups
for providing credit guarantees to loans extended to DPIIT recognized
startups by Scheduled Commercial Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies
(NBFCs) and Venture Debt Funds (VDFs) under SEBI registered Alternative
Investment Funds. CGSS is aimed at providing credit guarantee up to a
specified limit against loans extended by Member Institutions (MIs) to
finance eligible borrowers viz. DPIIT recognised startups. Regulatory
Reforms: Over 50 regulatory reforms have been undertaken by the
Government since 2016 to enhance ease of doing business, ease of raising
capital and reduce compliance burden for the startup ecosystem. Ease of
Procurement: To enable ease of procurement, Central Ministries/
Departments are directed to relax conditions of prior turnover and prior
experience in public procurement for all DPIIT recognised startups
subject to meeting quality and technical specifications. Further,
Government e-Marketplace (GeM) Startup Runway has been developed which
is a dedicated corner for startups to sell products and services
directly to the Government. Support for Intellectual Property

applications for patents, designs and trademarks through registered
facilitators in appropriate IP offices by paying only the statutory
fees. Facilitators under this Scheme are responsible for providing
general advisory on diff­erent IPRs, and information on protecting and
promoting IPRs in other countries. The Government bears the entire fees
of the facilitators for any number of patents, trademark or designs, and
startups only bear the cost of the statutory fees payable. Startups are
provided with an 80% rebate in filing of patents and 50% rebate in
filling of trademark vis-a-vis other companies. Self-Certification under
Labour and Environmental laws: Startups are allowed to self-certify
their compliance under 9 Labour and 3 Environment laws for a period of 3
to 5 years from the date of incorporation. Income Tax Exemption for 3
years: Startups incorporated on or after 1st April 2016 can apply for
income tax exemption. The recognized startups that are granted an
Inter-Ministerial Board Certificate are exempted from income-tax for a

The Fail-Safe Startup

Author

Tom Eisenmann

Publisher

Penguin Random House India

Pages: 343

Price: Rs 615

About 90 percent of startups fail. But why is it so? And is there a way
to avoid the common pitfalls when you start your own business?

Over the past 23 years at Harvard Business School, author Tom Eisenmann
has helped launch thousands of startups. An astonishing 13 of these have
reached unicorn status. For a decade, he has explored the question of
why startups fail, and this book explains how you can succeed against
the odds.

Mr Eisenmann's fascinating, often counter-intuitive, advice will help
startup founders avoid common mistakes, such as launching too early;
aiming too high, too soon; and letting early success lead to misplaced
confidence.

Drawing on case studies from startups of all shapes and sizes from
around the world, Mr Eisenmann's book shows how to analyze the failure
of others to ensure one's success.

The book attempts to illuminate a path to success by shining a spotlight
on common startup failure patterns. The author's insights are
invaluable, whether one is just getting started, or one is eyeing one's
endgame.

This is a must-read book for any entrepreneur, investor, startup team
member or any general reader.

About the author

Tom Eisenmann is the Howard H Stevenson Professor of Business
Administration at Harvard Business School (HBS) and faculty co-chair of
the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship. Since joining the HBS
faculty in 1997, he has launched eleven MBA courses on a range of topics
related to entrepreneurship. He has written over 100 HBS case studies
and writes regularly for many publications.

Exploring prospect of startups in developing countries

The Financial Express (Bangladesh)

August 10, 2019 Saturday

Copyright 2019 The Financial Express All Rights Reserved

Length: 1075 words

Dateline: Bangladesh

Body

Bangladesh, Aug. 10 -- A school teacher's job is to teach in the
classroom, and maybe to engage in a bit of tutoring too. Turning the
classroom teaching into a global learning platform is a success story of
a 37-year old teacher from India who became a billionaire. This is
certainly worth inspiring to pursue startups. Unfortunately, in the same
country, the news of the suicide of a startup luminary is heartbreaking.
The founder of Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) in replicating the idea of
Starbucks in India found his journey caught in an inescapable loss trap,
as his subsidy driven expansion strategy failed to develop a profitable
business model.

Startup has become an easy exit for politicians and bureaucrats in
developing countries to brush off unemployment, especially graduate
unemployment. However, given the mixed outcomes, how to succeed with
startup agenda has become a crucial issue, particularly for developing
countries like Bangladesh with 87th position among 100 countries in
StartupBlink Rankings Report. The focus should obviously be on
strengthening the startup ecosystem.

Startup has become a global phenomenon spreading across the world.
According to Inc42 DataLabs, India is home to 39,000 active startups,
and the number is growing. This startup population number might make
India the second largest startup hub in terms of sheer number. The
recent political agenda, startup India has significantly increased this
population. It has been reported that 15,472 startups have been
recognised under the Startup India programme recently. Among them,
13,176 recognised startups have reportedly created 1,48,897 jobs. To
accelerate the pace further, 24 Indian states have introduced startup
policies. The government also made 22 regulatory amendments and approved
1,275 patent rebates in the last three years. Funding for the startups
has also grown substantially. For example, upon housing 339k startups,
total funding ($11b) for startups in India in 2018 as compared to the
USA ($84b) and China ($63b) was 13 per cent and 17 per cent
respectively.

Among the developing countries, not only India and China and other south
Asian countries, but also Middle East and North African (MENA) countries
are also showing strong response to startup. 2018 saw a record number of
366 startup deals across MENA amounting to $893m of total investment.,
The year 2018 saw a record amount of funding in regional startups, up 31
per cent from 2017. The UAE remained the most active ecosystem with 30
per cent of all deals, followed by Egypt, which was the fastest growing
startup ecosystem. FinTech overtook E-commerce as the most active
industry by number of deals. More than 155 institutions invested in MENA
startups in 2018 -- 30 per cent from outside the region and 47 per cent
had not previously invested in the region. The recent announcement of
SoftBank to invest $2 billion in building digital infrastructure in
Indonesia is encouraging news for developing countries to leverage
startups.

The startup concept was coined in the USA to articulate the journey of
venture formation out of ideas developed in university and national
laboratories--often pursued by students and faculty members. But without
having research facilities, developing counties are promoting this
concept among the bright, creative students citing mega successes like
HP, Apple, Intel or Microsoft. Often the success of a great idea needs a
flow of ideas in making the product out of initial idea better as well
as cheaper to reach profit. In the absence of having a strong R&#38;D
ecosystem supplying that flow of ideas, bright graduates often end up
being like unpaid slaves in pursuing startups.

That does not mean that developing countries should say 'no' to
startups. Startup appears to be a viable alternative to conventional
subsidy and incentive-driven entrepreneurship to replicate, whether for
domestic consumption or export. It's time to strengthen the ecosystem to
increase the formation as well as success rate of startups. This appears
to be a serious development agenda for which most of the economic
planners, policy makers and also academics in developing countries and
LDCs (least developed countries) are not trained.

Despite the often cited bright side, there is a dark side of startup
success, which is not only limited to high failure rate of startups.
It's being reported by the Wall Street Journal, "entrepreneurs were 50
per cent more likely to report having a lifetime mental health condition
and reported significantly higher rates of depression, attention-deficit
disorder, substance abuse and bipolar disorder than a control group." An
often-cited issue in tech circles is that many startups fail because of
problems related to humans, and not to business issues, as a survey by
the National (USA) Bureau of Economic Research identified the management
team as the most important factor in startup failures.

But to succeed in startup, particularly in creating jobs for graduates,
it should be more than an easy exit. Most of the developing countries
are suffering from growing graduate unemployment. To address it,
politicians and bureaucrats are pointing to startup potential-asking
graduates to be creative and pursue great ideas. They are becoming
popular among the youth as they talk about start-up, innovation,
creativity, VC (venture capital) fund, incubation, and unicorn. Upon
offering seed capital and a place to work, bright youths are asked:
pursue your dream; the sky is the limit.

The digital economy has significant latent potential to drive economic
growth, virtually in every country. To show progress in building digital
economy, governments of some of the developing countries are focusing on
borrowing in financing digital infrastructure and service roll out, even
posing a risk to crowding out private investment. A smarter alternative
could be to focus on creating an ecosystem to encourage VC funds to flow
to turn ideas into digital economy success stories. To encourage VC
funds, growth prospects should be well articulated, demonstrated and
presented to empower investors to take bold decisions to scale up.

We are now on the fifth episode of the CEO's Guide to your Startup
Journey, and the topics that we have covered in the past are resource
management, setting up a robust infrastructure, talent management, and
customer experience. In the final episode, Vikas Bhonsle, CEO, Crayon
Software Experts spoke about the most important factor that determines
the success or failure of a startup - Cash Flow Optimisation.

Various studies have stated that the reason why a startup fails is
because they end up burning out their initial investments and funds
before they turn profitable. Vikas, in this episode highlights how
startups, with the aid of certain measures can optimise their finances
in a manner that the investments last until they become profitable.

Some of the things that startups can do to manage finances are as
follows:

* Work towards automating tasks that are repetitive and need no human
intervention, so that you can minimize your financial waste and help
your talented employees focus on more valuable tasks.

* Stick to coworking spaces as compared to a swanky new office until and
unless you can truly afford one.

* Try and maintain a passive income source for your company.

* Talent acquisition should be a very thoughtful process, as hiring
unnecessarily and too rapidly will negatively impact the organisation,
irreversibly harm the culture and will be burden on finances.

For startups, the difference between failure and success is networking

MINT

December 22, 2019 Sunday

Copyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 785 words

Dateline: BENGALURU

Body

BENGALURU, Dec. 22 -- Startups face strategic choices at different
stages that can make or break them. Take the example of Bengaluru-based
startup EnrichVideo, which helps enterprises use personalized videos to
increase sales conversions.

EnrichVideo faced a choice that's crucial for enterprise software
product startups: whether to be narrow-focused or cast the net wider at
an early stage. The temptation is to go wide because you're unsure where
the product will fit the market.

But EnrichVideo founder Chandu Sohoni decided to listen to three of his
peers who told him they had wasted six crucial months with the
broad-based approach.

The startup targeted banking, insurance and wealth management, and now
has customers like Motilal Oswal, DBS Treasures and IIFL Wealth.

"You'll never have enough data to make the choice between a narrow or
broad segment very clearly at an early stage," says Prasanna
Krishnamoorthy, founder of Upekkha accelerator for SaaS startups. "But
when three founders share their experiences, it's more concrete and
actionable than wishy-washy data or advice."

Two years ago when Upekkha started, Krishnamoorthy knew building
networks and communities was important. But now the approach is more
nuanced.

Networks are too amorphous, he feels, and communities are better at
providing shoulders to cry on. "Now we think of the learning part in a
more structured manner. Peer-to-peer learning comes from a
process-oriented format." This is now built into the Upekkha programme's
framework.

Finding people

Avinash Raghava, an organiser of SaaSBooMi and other startup events,
loves to build communities because "magic happens when people come
together". This goes beyond learning.

For example, finding suitable co-founders can be one of the hardest
bridges to cross for some. Others need the right investors who can give
them much more than just money.

For example, Indus Khaitan found his co-founder Naeem Zafar at Nasscom
Product Conclave. They went on to build Bitzer Mobile to help companies
give access to corporate data in a secure way through mobile devices.
Oracle acquired the startup.

Raghava saw two other outcomes triggered by networking events. Vipul
Mishra, founder of prototyping and usability testing platform
CanvasFlip, met one of his key mentors and investors Pallav Nadhani at a
ProductNation event. This year, at a SaaSBooMi event, it caught the eye
of Freshworks founder Girish Mathrubootham who decided to acquire the
startup. Similarly, Thinkflow Software was discovered at an Intech50
event by a US company which acquired it.

"People like me are connectors who enjoy bringing folks together and
build a community. Without that, a lot of people wouldn't get to meet
others and know what they're doing," says Raghava.

Alumni networks

Alumni networks are another powerful force multiplier. Subhendu
Panigrahi, founder of Bangalore startup Skillenza that specializes in
organising hackathons, used to head the entrepreneur cell at IIT
Kharagpur. His first corporate clients were those where his alumni were
CXOs.

The IITs and BITS Pilani also support their alumni networks in a
structured manner. And the culture of supporting one another begins on
campus itself and continues through the careers of IITians and BITsians.

Panigrahi himself had too low a ranking in the entrance exam for the
IITs to get his preferred option, which was computer science. He could
have done it at an NIT. But he chose to go to IIT Kharagpur anyway.

"My logic was that it was better to be the last guy among the best guys
rather the best guy among average guys," says Panigrahi.

"I've seen so many guys with ranks of 3,000-5,000 who still come to IIT
even though they had a chance to go to one of the NITs. They know it's
not just the IIT brand that will help them. The network is going to help
you the moment you're with the smart guys. They will become your
co-founders, first customers, investors, partners, so many things."

Whole companies are built around alumni. Panigrahi points out that the
initial team at cloud-based customer engagement software company
Capillary was almost entirely from IIT Kharagpur. Similarly, Flipkart
was built with IIT Delhi graduates and Ola with those from IIT Bombay.

The advent of messaging apps like WhatsApp has facilitated the formation
of multiple networks, with different identities. Some are just alumni,
others are more domain specific. For example, Bangalore has a new
community around Kotlin, the hot new programming language that's
throwing a challenge to Java.

Startups Guide: How can no-code software development empower small
businesses against big brands?

90% of Indian startups fail within five years, according to a report by
IBM Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics. Meanwhile in May
2020, IT industry veteran and founder of Infosys Ltd, Senapathy (Kris)
Gopalakrishnan, said that 25% of India's startups have less than six
months of runway. You might assume from these stats that the cards are
heavily stacked against Indian startups; that, there's not a lot they
can do to compete against bigger brands with hefty budgets, ample
resources and better access to new tech and innovations.

It may seem like Indian startups are doomed for failure. But that's far
too pessimistic for me. And the age-old excuse that lack of budget is to
blame - is both simplistic and inaccurate. Now don't get me wrong,
running out of money is a very real challenge for startups. But it's
just a small piece of the puzzle.

Startup failure is an amalgamation of many factors. When combined, are
too much for the startup to handle. For instance, inexperience in
managing a business, or unwillingness to delegate can cause operational
inefficiencies. This can impact the quality of service delivered to
customers. Then there's the all-too-common problem of poorly executed
marketing campaigns, which harm customer acquisition, engagement and
retention.

Let's not forget the complex role of technology and digital adoption in
the failure of startups. Not every founder needs to be the most
technically astute person. But in small businesses, a lack of technical
expertise, coupled with small budgets and minimal resources, can leave
owners feeling overwhelmed at the prospect of developing software and
apps. And now more than ever before, these are critical in acquiring new
users, building engagement. It also helps in converting users into loyal
customers and generating consistent revenue streams.

This is problematic for a few reasons.

First, it highlights a glaring misconception. Contrary to what many tech
industry veterans are saying, I would urge small business owners and
founders to not learn to code or expend time in trying to become tech
experts. That won't help your business grow, scale and compete against
bigger brands.

On top of this is the presumption that software/app development requires
a long lead time, a web development agency to manage the project from
start to finish and large purse strings to pay for everything. Causing
many small business owners to give up - without even trying to compete
against the bigger brands. Or worse yet, they spend excessive money
(already limited) hiring a development agency to build new software and
apps. But because they spent almost all of their annual budget to hire
the agency and had to wait upwards of 6-9 months to complete the
project, they lost a good portion of their customers to competitors and
eventually lost their business.

How can small businesses stay competitive and thrive?

They need to change their mindset. Stop believing that a smaller budget
and lack of technical expertise are obstacles too great to overcome.
They aren't. Taking advantage of no-code/low-code software development
will give startups the runway to acquire new customers. It will also
increase customer engagement, generate more sales and build trust with
customers.

Why is no-code/low-code development the weapon Indian startups need to
push back against bigger brands?

For one, small businesses can actually own the software/app after it's
been developed. They can make sure to release it on the app stores.
Second, no-code/low-code development cuts the time it takes to build and
deploy apps from 9+ months down to one to two weeks. Unlike web
development agencies, small businesses won't have to pay upfront to
build the specs for their project. Add the integration of back-end,
customer support and ecommerce systems, the use of visual modelling and
speed of innovation. Then it is clear just how powerful no-code/low-code
development can be for small businesses.

The truth is, India has been a destination for low-cost, outsourced
software and support services since the late 1980s. And no-code/low-code
development is vital not only in rebuilding the Indian economy but also
in giving bootstrapped startups the runway to compete against big brands
and thrive for decades to come.

Sattvik 2018: What shall we take away

Minds on the Margin

Would you not enjoy at Sattvik, an unusual dish for us that is,
aranchini rice ball made of aromatic rice Joha stuffed with different
vegetables? Or for that matter, a cheela made of drumstick leaves by
another group might give you nutrition, taste and aesthetic pleasure. So
many farmers and entrepreneurs have brought different traditional and
new dishes. Painting dry cotton balls in different colours is a children
idea from dendhuki. You can visit Sattvik tomorrow and also on 25th to
partake satvik food, ingredients, crafts are on display by 50 women
groups supported by Ministry of Women and Child Development from Jammu
and Krishna, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttarakhand,
Bihar and so any more places.

Children are enjoying the innovation maze designed by GIAN team.
Children have to find their way out and when they get lost, they find a
new innovation. Should not we all get lost some time if that helps us
discover innovations. There is a photo shoot site nearby on a designer
cycle rickshaw and also a children creativity spot near GIAN maze. Come
and get lost.

It in addition to this, we have tried to add more meaningful cultural
activities this time including a poetry session chaired by Shri
Raghuveer Chaudhary, a distinguished Jianpeeth awardee. Sessions by
eminent doctors on preventive health including by ayurvedic experts,
physiotherapist, orthopaedic experts, diabetic specialists etc., are
also there.

There were several policy advocacy sessions on behalf of organic farmers
and start-ups. Some of the suggestions we made are: a) there should be
open access space in every city for farmers to sell their organic
produce directly to consumers; b) just as start-ups, generally from
urban areas, have been given five years of relief from a lot of
procedural requirements, organic farmers should also be allowed for at
least ten years to sell their products without too many restrictions and
requirements; c) farmers income cannot be increased without reducing
costs. One way is to reduce the cost of inputs by using herbal
pesticides and growth promoters. SRISTI has perhaps the only lab
dedicated to develop such products and test their efficacy. We need many
more such well-equipped labs in the country to promote sustainable
agriculture; d) dissemination of sustainable practices through kisan
call centre must become obligatory. AT this stage they just promote
chemical including some which are banned in many other countries; e) the
start-ups should share their failures and set back to help budding
entrepreneurs in charting their future path; f) not many states have
included the stories of innovators from and for grassroots in the
textbooks and curriculum; how will a culture of innovation evolve in the
true terms, g) the support from regulatory agencies need a lot of
strengthening. The motorcycle based and now chahsis based santi,
multipurpose agri machine sis still not eligible for to approval and
thus is illegal in the strict sense of the terms Every year Gujarat
itself has a sale of about ten thousand santis, all illegal but all
legitimate. On one had government has a policy of promoting circular
economy but on the other, it will not approve solutions using
second-hand parts.

I hope we will hear from many of you in coming two days more suggestions
to make the eco-system for promoting women based enterprises, organic
agriculture, farmer-consumer interface and promotion of innovations for
and from grassroots. We will pursue many more ideas at the fourth
International conference by the Honey Bee Network on Creativity and
Innovation at IIMA January 28-30, 2019. You are welcome to register at
iccig.org and learn and share your ideas.

Business News - Ethique Founder Launches New Initiative to Reduce
Failure of Kiwi Social Enterprises

A new support initiative has launched to help reduce the failure of New
Zealand startups with an environmental or social purpose.

According to latest Government data, less than half (45%) of New Zealand
startups, including those with a social mission, will survive past their
first five years.[1]

The Business, but Better initiative was created by Brianne West, founder
of the country's largest regenerative beauty product exporter, Ethique.

West will announce she is stepping down as Ethique CEO this week, almost
11 years after starting the $100 million business in her kitchen as a
24-year-old biochemistry student. During her tenure, the company has
exported its range of sustainable shampoo bars and soaps to over 8,000
retailers in 22 countries and, prevented 25 million plastic bottles from
entering landfill.

West says while she will remain with the company to support across
product, sustainability and brand, her focus will be on supporting
hundreds of entrepreneurs who want to start and scale up a social or
environmental business venture that has the potential to change the
world for the better.

Research shows women are more likely to start a mission-led business
however they can face a number of barriers including poor access to
information, funding and gender-specific networks and support.[2]

West says while there is a significant amount of entrepreneurial talent
in New Zealand, who are willing to offer their time and guidance, there
is a shortage of female mentors in NZ and research shows women prefer to
be guided by other women.

She says other countries have a legally defined business entity category
designed specifically for mission-led companies, such as benefit
corporations in North America, which could be considered as part of a
regulatory framework - to recognise the inherent value of social
enterprises to the New Zealand economy.

West developed the Business, but Better initiative to help entrepreneurs
learn from the "many" mistakes made while Ethique was in its startup
phase and says they have had international interest from a wide range of
environmentally and socially focused ventures.

The programme provides entrepreneurs with an extensive video resource
covering a wide range of topics including branding, funding and
exporting - as well as regular group mentoring and individual one-on-one
mentoring sessions.

West says just three weeks after launching, the programme's first
marketing course intake is full and the platform has already attracted
interest from social enterprise founders in the USA, UK and Australia,
as well as New Zealand.

"The level of demand has caught us by surprise; however we believe it is
a reflection of the unmet need for greater support for social startups
both locally and abroad.

"We know that social enterprises are much more likely to be led by women
than traditional startups, and they are often headed by young
entrepreneurs.

"While more mature businesses can readily apply for R&D funding to
explore new markets, there is little in the way of customised support
for mission-led startups - and it is a significant contributor to their
high failure rate," she says.

West says one of her early mistakes as a female entrepreneur included a
self-taught foray into the registration of their global trademarks.

"The first time I registered a trademark I could not afford an IP lawyer
and so I applied under an international trademark protocol known as the
Madrid System to register the brand across multiple off-shore markets.

"This immediately triggered the arrival of a series of letters each
demanding a payment of 2,000 Euros to various 'IP officers' around the
world.

"They looked extremely legitimate, and I panicked thinking they were
real and it was only by sheer luck I found out it was a well-known scam.

"I also didn't bother to register a trademark in Australia - and later
had to change the original business name.

"Learning from these experiences and many others, I wanted to create a
resource and sounding board for other entrepreneurs to learn from the
misadventures I experienced during the startup phase.

West says the platform was developed following the realisation that she
could help significantly more entrepreneurs through the creation of a
video library resource, which can be used in conjunction with customised
mentoring sessions.

"Trial and error is a great way to learn in some respects, but it can
incur more cost and stress than a startup entrepreneur can manage.

"The objective of the programme is to remove some of the common pitfalls
associated with launching a business and help these fledgling ventures
make it to maturity," she says.

West says she can be scathing of some of the traditional business advice
that is commonly disseminated, which is not well aligned with the social
enterprise model.

"What we know is that business models have changed significantly in
recent years.

"The old-school concept of staying on-shore until you are profitable or
the prerequisite of having a 50-page business plan is no longer
relevant - as international markets have become much more accessible,
even to early-stage SMEs," she says

West says the programme is designed to integrate with a multi-million
dollar fund and incubation initiative, Nous Labs.

West says more information about how entrepreneurs can access support
through Business, but Better is available here.

Figure 3: Crude Oil Processed (Crude Throughput) 

 

-   

-   CPSE Refineries' crude oil processed during August, 2020 was 8722.76
    TMT which is 31.12% lower than the target for the month and 30.18%
    lower when compared with August, 2019. Cumulative crude throughput
    by CPSE refineries during April-August, 2020 was 44900.15 TMT which
    is 24.37% and 25.71% lower than target for the period and crude
    throughput during corresponding period of last year respectively.
    Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

-   IOCL- Barauni, Mathura and Bongaigaon: Lower due to COVID-19
    Pandemic i.e. low product demand.

1.  IOCL-Gujarat & Panipat: Crude throughput regulated for high HSD
    stock for low product demand due to COVID impact.

1.  IOCL-Haldia: Crude throughput regulated for high DHDS feed stock and
    High HSD stock due to COVID impact.

1.  IOCL- Digboi: Crude throughput regulated due to high VR stock for
    high DCU skin temperature.

1.  IOCL-Paradip: Crude throughput low due to planned shutdown deferred
    from Jun-Jul'20 to Jul-Aug'20 and low product demand.

1.  HPCL-Mumbai & Visakh: Lower due to planned shutdown of secondary
    units and impact of COVID situation.

1.  CPCL-Manali: Crude throughput lower due to lower product demand on
    account of Covid-19 lockdown & M&I shutdown. 

1.  MRPL-Mangalore: Lower due to Lower demand due to impact of COVID-19
    lockdown.

1.  NRL- Numaligarh: Lower due to maintained in line with demand of
    MS/HSD

3.2       JV refineries' crude oil processed during August, 2020 was
1498.34 TMT which is 21.22% higher than the target for the month but

during April-August, 2020 was 6135.51 TMT which is 0.55% higher than
target for the period but 27.86% lower when compare with the
corresponding period of last year respectively. A major reason of lower
crude oil processed in BORL Bina was lower product demand in view of
COVID 19 pandemic.

Covid-spooked startup funding may not fully recover this year; majority

would prefer working with startups in their current portfolio until the
situation improves instead of working on new deals.

Going forward, 59 per cent investors would prefer working with startups
in their current portfolio until the situation improves instead of
working on new deals.

Covid's impact on startup funding is unlikely to wither away anytime
soon. The investments into startups will continue to be impacted over
the next six months, according to 92 per cent investors surveyed by
FICCI and Indian Angel Network. Out of 27 investors who were part of the
survey that included 250 startups and 34 incubators, 56 per cent claimed
moderate impact while 40 per cent said there would be a severe impact on
startup funding due to Covid. Consequently, 59 per cent of investors
going forward would prefer working with startups in their current
portfolio until the situation improves instead of working on new deals.

As Covid has led to increased adoption of digital services such as
online education among students and healthcare, investors' preference
has also been realigned with the shift in opportunities. For instance,
from fintech, health, AI & deep tech, edtech and agri as top-five
priority sectors before lockdown have been changed to health, edtech, AI
& deep tech, fintech and agri.

Moreover, the response from investors to pitches made by startups before
lockdown hasn't been encouraging as only 8 per cent startups have been
able to sign the agreement and receive the funds during the lockdown. On
the other hand, 33 per cent startups said that the decision to invest
has been put on hold by investors while for 32 per cent startups there
is no response from investors. For rest 17 per cent are yet to receive
funds while for 10 per cent, the deal has been cancelled, according to
the survey titled Impact of Covid-19 on Indian Startups.

"VCs are doing the same thing that angels are doing. Because it is
isolation, you are not able to talk to startups. How long and how many
deals can you close by connecting online. You cannot move from one
building to another. You cannot close deals like that. Also, I know a
lot of portfolio companies will miss their growth projections since a
lot of cash is diverted to Coronavirus-related expenses. Coronavirus
will be one major factor for startup shutdowns or failures in 2020,"
Padmaja Ruparel, Co-founder, Indian Angel Network had told Financial
Express Online.

70 per cent startup respondents claimed negative impact on business due
to Covid while 60 per cent said they are operating with some disruption.
Also, in terms of cash reserves available to pay for fixed costs post
lockdown, 38 per cent startups had reserves for 1-3 months only while 22
per cent said to cash reserves for 3-6 months. Only 7 per cent startups
had cash for more than a year to bear the fixed cost. Among cost
reduction measures, 68 per cent startups have reduced administrative and
operational costs while only 18 per cent have sought layoffs.

"The start-up sector is stressed for survival at the moment. The
investment sentiment is also subdued and is expected to remain so in the
coming months. Lack of working capital and cash flows may lead to major
layoffs over the next 3-6 months by start-ups," said Dilip Chenoy,
Secretary-General, FICCI said in a statement.

Meanwhile, startup funding in the first half of 2020 has declined 11 per
cent in terms of the amount and 31 per cent with respect to the number
of deals from the year-ago period, according to the data from Venture
Intelligence. Investors poured $4.1 billion in 270 deals in startups
during H1 2020 in comparison to $4.6 billion put in 393 deals during H1
2019. While the first quarter of 2020 was slightly better in terms of
funding with investments secured by OYO ($807 million), Byju's ($200
million), Swiggy (around $155 million), Zomato (around $155 million),
etc, the second quarter activity was a bit dull with prominent deals
made by Postman ($150 million) and Byju's (undisclosed amount in June
raised from BOND) only.

Engineering is always creatively unique and innovative. However, our
education structures are skewed in such a manner which often encourages
an engineering student to be an inventor. The panel discussed that what
traits and skills one needs to become a good engineer and what can make
them competent enough who would become creative innovators and
entrepreneurs of the future.

The moderator of this session is Prof. (Dr.) Prem Vrat, Pro
Vice-Chancellor, North Cap University. The panel consisted of people
from academics like, Ms. Aruna M. Katara, President, Hope Foundation's
Finolex Academy of Management & Technology, Dr. Rihan Khan Suri,
Training & Placement, Jamia Millia Islamia University, Dr. Urvashi
Makkar, Director General, G.L. Bajaj Institute of Management & Research,
Anurag Bansal, Sr VP-Career Launcher and NP Padhy, Dean Academic affairs
IIT Roorkee.

According to Ms. Aruna M. Katara, there is a need for the entrepreneurs
to focus on producing products with commercial value. Furthermore, she
dismissively talked about the practice of importing technology instead
of creating them in India. The reason for importing technology,
according to Dr. Rihan Khan Suri is the absence of a culture of
entrepreneurship and the culture of creativity in our country's
institutions. He asserts that, in order to encourage entrepreneurship in
India, we must first change the mindset of graduates who run after
placements offering lucrative pay packages. This according to him, is
possible if the institutions motivate their students to take risks,
while also providing them backups in case of the failure of their
start-ups. Agreeing with the statement, Mr. Anurag Bansal said that
engineers in India are very creative. Carrying forward the discussion,
Dr. Urvashi Makkar, busted the myth that dropouts become successful
entrepreneurs by highlighting that the idea is 'unnecessarily
glamorised.' She concluded her speech by emphasizing that students with
entrepreneurship skills succeed in life.

Gold Price Today, 13 March: Gold gains as dollar, yields slip on rate

India on 13 March: Globally, the yellow metal prices rose on Monday to
their highest in more than five weeks as the dollar weakened.

Gold Rate Today, Gold Price in India on 13 March: Globally, the yellow
metal prices rose on Monday to their highest in more than five weeks as
the dollar weakened.

Gold Price Today, Gold Price Outlook, Gold Price Forecast: Gold rate is
trading higher on Monday despite mixed global cues, while the silver
rate is up 1.21%. On Multi Commodity Exchange, gold April futures were
trading at Rs 56,615 per 10 grams, up Rs 465 or 0.83%. Silver May
futures were trading higher by Rs 760 at Rs 63,650 per kg on MCX.

Globally, the yellow metal prices rose on Monday to their highest in
more than five weeks as the dollar weakened, while jitters over the
largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis drove
investors to the safe-haven asset, according to Reuters. Spot gold was
up 0.5% at $1,877.30 per ounce, after hitting its highest since 3
February earlier in the session at $1,893.96. U.S. gold futures gained
0.8% to $1,882.10.

Gold prices to remain volatile

"The gold and silver market posted an unexpected weekly gain last week
on potential contagion risks from the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) meltdown
and heavy selling in the dollar index. Gold and silver prices reached
one month high and crossed their important resistance. The U.S. non-farm
employment shows growth of 3,11,000 jobs in February against expected
growth of 2,24,000 jobs but data is well below from the January month's
job growth of 5,17,000. The U.S. unemployment also surged to 3.6% in
February month against expectations of 3.4%. The U.S. dollar index fell,
and the two-year yield posted its biggest two-day decline since 2008,
which is very supportive of higher gold prices. The U.S. Fed called an
emergency meeting on Monday after the SVB bank saga which could keep
precious metals volatile.

We expect gold and silver to remain volatile in today's session. Gold
has support at $1852-1840 while resistance is at $1871-1880. Silver has
support at $20.44-20.25, while resistance is at $20.82-20.98. In INR
terms gold has support at Rs 56,020-55,710, while resistance is at Rs
56,510, 56,780. Silver has support at Rs 62,420-62,010, while resistance
is at Rs 63,490-63,980," said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta
Equities.

Gold prices hit five-week high

"Gold prices rose to their highest in more than five weeks amidst
positive US economic data, fall in dollar and jitters over the largest
U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, driving investors to
the safe-haven asset. California banking regulators closed Silicon
Valley Bank on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) as receiver for later disposition of its assets.
Also, State regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank on Sunday.
U.S. officials have stepped in to stem financial fallout from the
failure of tech startup-focused Silicon Valley Bank, saying that all
customers would have access to their deposits starting on Monday.

"Data towards the end of last week showed the U.S. economy added jobs at
a brisk clip in February, monthly wage growth slowed and the
unemployment rate rose, pointing to some labour market loosening and
prompting financial markets to dial back expectations that the Federal
Reserve would raise interest rates by half a percentage point this
month. Focus today will be inflation data on the domestic front. Broader
trend on COMEX could be in the range of $1870-1895 and on domestic front
prices could hover in the range of Rs 56,250-56,950," said Manav Modi,
MOFSL.

About 40% of startups do not take off in India. The need of the hour is
to identify reasons for their failure and to improve selection criteria,
said Dr V G Patel, former director of Entrepreneurship Development
Institute of India (EDII).

He was speaking at the inauguration of the 13th International Biennial
Conference on Entrepreneurship at EDII on Wednesday. The three-day
conference will see 147 papers presented, including 16 from researchers
from Bangladesh, France, Iran, Israel, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Poland,
Switzerland and Russia.

Dr Sunil Shukla, director of EDII, said that the entrepreneurship
scenario in India is changing fast and such conferences will help steer
future policy decisions. “We need research on why 40% of startups fail
in their first three years,” Dr Patel said in his speech. TNN

Inspired by YourStory, author Stuti Changle pens exciting book with
startups as theme, wants to inspire youth to make a move

What happens when three twenty-somethings begin to get restless with
whatever they are doing at the moment and want to break free? Kabir
wonders how life would be if he were to build something on his own. Myra
wants to escape her cubicle. Sandy drops out of college to pursue the
next big startup idea, and the three are united by Ramy inspires
millions on his travel blog But their journey is far from perfect.

In her book, On The Open Road - Three Lives. Five Cities. One Startup,
debutant author Stuti Changle explores the lives of these young people
as they attempt an empowering journey to start up a company. Will they
succeed on the road less travelled?

In an interview with HerStory, Stuti tells us all about the book, her
inspirations, and why she chose to write on startups.

HerStory: Tell us a little about yourself.

Stuti Changle: I hail from Indore and completed my schooling from
various schools across India. I am a postgraduate in management from
International Management Institute, New Delhi, and a graduate in
Computer Science and Technology. I have dreamed of being an author since
childhood and one day, in 2016, when I was 23, I packed a rucksack and
left Mumbai, in search of my true self. I met people with extraordinary
stories - travellers, entrepreneurs, artists, visionaries and saints,
who gave me the revelation to take steps in a new direction. I penned my
debut novel - On The Open Road - Three Lives, Five Cities, and One
Startup. I am glad that it is now receiving a tremendous response from
readers. It draws from my real-life experiences and I wish to inspire my
readers to follow their heart and live their dreams!

A traveller at heart, I find myself moving farther from the never-ending
quest of owning material possessions and a step closer to owning a vast
ocean of experiences.

HS: What prompted the book, and why?

SC:On The Open Road - Three Lives. Five Cities. One Startup happened
during my stint at a major corporate. I was sipping a cappuccino and
wondering about my next career move. I was making money - a lot of it -
but somehow felt empty on the inside. My heart would tell me to pursue
my long lost dream of becoming a storyteller, whereas my mind would warn
me about the risk and its consequences. Later on, I realised that a lot
of millennials, including my friends and colleagues, struggled with a
sense of meaning in their lives and wondered about their true purpose.
All this led to the development of the characters and the plot of the
story. That's a reason why a lot of my readers tell me that they can
relate to each and every line of the story. I hope to inspire the youth
with my stories - to break free, to make difficult choices, to follow
their dreams, to never give up, and to discover their true self!

HS: Can you tell me more about the premise of the book, how you chose
the characters, etc?

SC: The book is a heart touching and an inspiring journey of three souls
who resolve to pursue their dreams and battle against all odds to start
up a company. Myra, Kabir and Sandy, the main characters of the story,
are twenty-somethings from young India who battle societal taboos as
well as their inner demons to live life on their own terms.

Myra is struggling at her corporate job while Kabir wonders how life
would be to build on his own. Sandy is the quintessential startup
enthusiast who doesn't fear failing, and keeps at his vision. They're
all united by a travel blogger - Ramy, who runs the blog called 'On The
Open Road'.

The story is about breaking free from routine lives to be able to
embrace the new. It encapsulates the emotional journey that one has to
take to be able to live their dreams. Through my novel, I want to say it
out loud that we, the youth, are the future of the nation, and it is
time we boldly pursue our choices. Let's build the India of the future
through entrepreneurship, because each one of us, no matter where we
come from, has that one idea that holds the potential to touch a million
lives.

HS: Why did you choose the startup world and 20-somethings as the theme
on which your book revolves?

SC: My heroes or role models have always been artists and entrepreneurs.
When I quit my job, many entrepreneurs became my go-to people to take
career advice from. At the same time, I followed the journey of tech
startup founders from India on YourStory. The startup culture in India
is mushrooming in all major cities; students or professionals are more
willing to embrace the risks and failures of starting up given they can
positively impact a million lives someday.

It is truly inspiring and I felt that India lacked a strong fictional
narrative in books and movies on the same. Fiction has the power to move
people through the magic one can weave using words. While we had a lot
of new articles that mentioned the non-emotional aspects of starting up,
bringing out the emotional struggle could only be justified through a
story. Twenty-somethings are building phenomenal ventures in India.
Also, we have a major population in that segment, and it made sense that
I encouraged them to "make a move" through my story and help build the
India of the future through entrepreneurship.

HS: You say your book is drawn from real-life experiences. Can you tell
us more about this?

SC: Yes, that's true. It draws hugely from my experiences when I quit my
job and decided to take the plunge. I do relate to Myra the most as her
journey is much like my own. Characters, ordinary or larger than life,
relatable or aspirational, are the most crucial part of the story.
Readers experience various emotions through the journey of the
characters. Readers evolve through the challenges, the struggles and the
achievements of the characters. They feel inspired enough to take
specific action if they are thrilled by the journey of their favourite
character.

All the characters are based on people whom I have met and therefore are
relatable. A strong supporting character, Mr Kashyap, is inspired by
Ashish Kashyap (founder of Goibibo and redBus). I had never met him
until the completion of my book, but as I look up to him as a role model
in the startup world, I built the character through some secondary
research and my own imagination. On completion of the book, I reached
out to him and told him about the same. He found the idea of a fiction
story on startups really amazing and encouraged me to keep at my
creative work.

HS: What are your future plans?

SC: Apart from writing, I also take up speaking engagements, and travel
to places telling stories that add value to my audiences. My mission is
to inspire people to become the best version of themselves through my
stories. I am also working on the next story. It is a part of On The
Open Road series, but is a standalone work of inspirational fiction
again, and not a prequel or sequel exactly. Ramy - the travel blogger,
the favourite character from On The Open Road, is part of the next one
too.

Jan 29, 2020( The Hindu Business Line:
http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Party's focus
is on its core constituents — the domestic industry and the trader
community To lift the depressed sentiment especially among its core
constituency of Swadeshi industrialist and traders, the BJP's thrust in
the upcoming Budget, and Parliament session, is expected to be on
deregulation, ring-fencing bankers to facilitate better lending, and
rationalising the duty structure to ease the supply-side
constraints.Simultaneously, the ruling party wants fresh infusion of
funds through the Rs. 105-lakh crore National Investment and
Infrastructure Fund into cement, steel, and construction equipment as
well as higher allocation for PM Kisan, MNREGA, Ayushman Bharat, Ujjwala
Yojna and PM Awas Yojna to boost consumer demand.In the agriculture
sector, stress will be on expediting the establishment of 22,000 local
mandis to ease marketing bottlenecks.Key initiativesBesides, 32 other
initiatives are to be taken towards addressing the concerns of telecom,
auto, real estate sectors, MSMEs and the liquidity crunch in NBFCs.The
BJP held 11 meetings between December 19 and January 14, where Finance
Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and party office-bearers met stakeholders
identified in three groups — Sunrise Sector including IT, pharma and
automobile companies; High-Growth Potential Sector with regard to
employment including MSMEs, real-estate, agriculture, heavy industry and
food processing; and Core/Backbone Sector including financial markets
and mercantile law including GST, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
and company law.A consolidated report of assessments and suggestions
that emerged from these meetings was submitted to Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.Confidence buildingThe core idea is to instil in the
industry a sense of confidence, which is low due to excessive regulation
and funds squeeze.

Besides ring-fencing bankers for genuine lending decisions and creating
liquidity, the BJP has suggested 46 amendments to
#8216;decriminalise#8217; the company law.#8216;The overall sentiment is
towards deleveraging companies. Besides reduction in corporate tax that
has already been done, more steps need to be taken towards easing
liquidity as debt is an important component of capital investment. We
also have to accept that genuine business risk and failures are not to
be treated as crimes. For instance, 95 per cent of new ventures in the
start-up ecosystem ended as failures. They cannot be treated as
frauds,#8217; said BJP spokesperson on economic affairs Gopal Krishna
Agarwal.A #8216;de-clogging#8217; of the IBC and NCLAT has been
suggested with the aim more of resolution than regulation. The
resolution mechanism has to separate genuine business failures,
mismanagement and fraud as three separate categories and the thrust has
to be towards revival of businesses, especially in the case of
mismanagement.Streamlining GST and FTAsSimultaneously, the ruling party
wants the Centre to focus on streamlining the GST and FTAs, especially
those with the ASEAN countries, and address the issues of domestic MSMEs
by correcting the inverted duty structure.#8216;Let us renegotiate the
FTAs and tweak the GST to correct the inverted duty structures. A
comprehensive decision has to be taken to reduce duties on critical
inputs used in domestic manufacturing while raising them on finished
products,#8217; said Agarwal.The BJP's aim is to enhance the Swadeshi
spirit that was in evidence in India's rejection of RCEP and safeguard
its interests vis--vis the US General Trade Agreement in the past.
#8216;We have to protect our industry. The whole world is doing
it,#8217; said the BJP spokesperson.The BJP has worked on focussing
policy direction towards concerns of its original core constituents —
the domestic industry and the trader community. Swadeshi seems to be the
theme dictated by the party's headquarters.

Why Your Crypto Startup Is Doomed To Failure

Dec 10, 2018( TechBullion: http://www.techbullion.com Delivered by
Newstex) If you are not confused by the sad statistics on the number of
failed ICO projects in 2018, you believe in the great and indestructible
potential of the technology of the distributed registry and you are
ready for the difficulties let's take off the rose-colored glasses and
see what should not be done to avoid being on the list of losers. The
successful completion of ICO is just the beginning of your project. Some
statistics According toCoinschedule[1], 983 projects were launched in
2018, but only 21 startups were able to achieve the desired hard
cap.More than half of the launched ICOs did not even attract 50% of the
stated amount.The number of failed projects also includes the projects
that were closed at the initial offering stage, and outright scams, deal
with the organizers of which will have to law enforcement. These results
are disappointing and repel more and more investors from the industry,
who massively get rid of savings on their cryptocurrency accounts under
the pressure of hectic market in recent time.

The truth, which everyone knows, but it is indecent to talk about in a
society. If you still believe that you will be able to conquer the
industry and become the 22nd winner of the ICO race, then get ready for
the truth. Initial Coin Offering is not a story about finances for those
who don't have them. Yes, it may have seemed so at the very beginning,
when tokens were based on the air, and anyone who has ever attended a
thematic conference declared himself an expensive cryptocurrency expert
in a Linkedin profile. The time of easy money is over, and those, who
wish to enter the ICO market must change their strategy drastically. But
I still have some good news for you: to say that the potential of ICO is
completely exhausted, it is too early. A startup will never grow into an
empire if:your idea is not claimed, and the product solves only the
problems that you have invented yourself; the founders don't have a
technological background, and in their understanding, the word
'blockchain' is only a new trend, on the wave of which you can make good
money; the team consists of pseudo-experts, which position themselves as
gurus of the blockchain market; the marketer, adopted in the project,
offers on the main landing page to place 'Revenue growth by 2000%' and
everything in this spirit; you don't know what to offer the industry and
try to implement blockchain technology into those processes, where its
use is not necessary; the budget for the ICO campaign equals ten dinners
in a restaurant. An idea that solves non-existent problemsThe first
thing to think about is whether your project is needed and what problems
it will help the community to solve. Unfortunately, a lot of the
presented projects with high-flown words on the sites, such as 'global'
and 'high-tech', do not answer at all global and high-tech questions. It
is appropriate to mention here the cooperation of Mercedes and the
manufacturer of the energy drink SilberPfeil. The companies decided to
encourage sellers energy drink with AMG tokens for each sold bottle. On
the surface, it may seem like a great idea - a well-known brand as a
partner, a reward for the sale, but Using a specific token in one
direction is completely impractical. SilberPfeil could not prove to the
crypto players that their token has long-term prospects. As a result, it
was not possible to attract the desired amount during the ICO. There are
quite absurd projects in the industry. For example, ICO Rexpax with
Belarusian roots, using the blockchain, assured its potential investors
that it is the last century to share things with neighbors without their
token. That is, nobody could take the salt from a neighbor from the
second floor without this blockchain platform. As a result, the
community also didn't share this philosophy, and the team has not been
in touch since last February. If we analyze this situation we can see
that CEO of Rexpax invented a non-existent problem, embellished its
solution with a blockchain and expected to attract investors with his
idea. Let's learn from the mistakes of others and implement the global
technology only in those products where it really benefits. You need to
understand that its integration should simplify many processes, and not
vice versa. The founder must know everything About his project exactly.
It is sad to watch an interview with another CEO who turns red after a
basic technical question. In our time business is people, and it
attracts like-minded people only when there is trust in top management.
Gone are the days when a serious businessman in a tie, who might not
even know the media, was at the head of a large corporation. Now there
are cool and inquisitive guys in the business, they are in polo and in
sneakers, they can easily answer for their projects, protect them and
present them in such a way that you want to give your money. CEO without
a team is a hipster without a beard The team is the core of the project,
its brain and engine. A few years ago it was really difficult to find
specialists, but now the market of professionals has begun to take
shape: they are purposeful, work overtime and walk with their heads held
high. The future founder should understand those worthy candidates who
are able to bring the project to the desired level belong to generation
Z. The Millennials are not accustomed to obey, but they make compromises
and work according to the rule: 'We don't work as we are told, we were
hired to talk you about how to work'. With a limited budget, but a great
desire to get the best employees, professionals of the industry often
receive offers to pay for their work with tokens (which, by the way,
still have to develop). If you are focused on fruitful cooperation, we
assure you that an experienced Senior developer will not attract in this
case, but a beginner with a zero background might be interested.
However, the quality of his work can be immediately silent. There are
often situations when the project creator has to ask for the help of
more experienced development teams in order to correct the mistakes of
their inexperienced colleagues. Of course, it will strike another blow
to your budget. The miser pays twice and doesn't say that we did not
warn you. If you plan to hire professionals, promise them a decent fee
and do not fulfill your promises, we advise you to refuse such a plan in
advance. Despite the full scope of the industry, the community is quite
narrow, professionals always intersect at specialized events and support
communication with each other. Doing it once, you won't put together a
second good team - your reputation will be destroyed. Developers: a
separate conversation Half of the projects created with the involvement
of developers from India, ready to work for $ 1000, but back to the
statistics clause (more than 50% of ICO failed miserably). To realize a
grandiose idea under the force only the pumped guys with accumulated
skills, the average salary of which starts from $ 5,000. It is difficult
to assemble such pros in one place - more than 90% of developers are
already involved in other significant projects or make their product
in-house. If you don't have time and desire to form a strong development
department, you can turn to ready-made teams of blockchain developers
who have successfully established themselves in the market. In this
case, there are several undeniable advantages:the team is already
organized in advance, a waste of time in dating is eliminated by itself;
developers have accumulated experience in implementing blockchain
solutions of various levels; you can always turn to them for advice
because the guys have been in the industry for a long time and are up to
date with the latest trends.; they are responsible for the quality of
their reputation, which plays a key role in this industry.If you take
into account all the above facts, then you will be able to create a
strong team with a large-scale technological background and reach the
planned level. Festive packaging for your idea The marketing department
is responsible for the face of your project and in the current realities
it is becoming more and more difficult to find a beautiful face. A CV
with a promising Blockchain Marketing Expert headline and stories of
attracted millions for previous projects can hide a narcissist
copywriter, who learned how to customize advertising on Instagram. Do
not fall for beautiful fairy tales, check out his previous projects,
study their marketing strategies and write on Facebook to the
representatives of the startups mentioned in the resume, just in case:
maybe the candidate didn't work there at all (such cases have occurred,
so light attacks of paranoia are appropriate here). Budget We left the
most important, money issue for dessert, as many do not pay this detail
due attention. The budgets, that the future CEO expects, are often
cannot cover even half of the costs, arising during the preparation for
the ICO-campaign. Some expect to provide a team for the first two months
and then pay bills with raised funds. However, there are the other
problems associated with marketing, legal solutions and community
support, which delay the initial deadlines and are very expensive.
Conclusion Cryptocurrency industry is developing by leaps and bounds,
gaining more and more turns, but the rules are dictated tougher with
each passing month. It becomes more difficult to surprise investors and
to gain their trust is a challenge for real crypto heroes. On the other
hand, it is an indicator of the maturing market, where there should be
no place for fraudsters and not serious business. We are sure that this
article, which is based on our own experience, though boldly, but in
full given you the food for thought and will help your startup to
contribute to the history of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Recommended

ABSTRACT

Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of Muslim society
marriages → forced, arranged or marriages of choice/love, on women
entrepreneurial intentions (EI), with reference to Ajzen’s (2002) theory
of planned behaviour. It is postulated that marriage type has a
significant influence on women household dynamics towards EI and
business growth.

Design/methodology/approach

A qualitative methodology was used and a total of 20 semi-structured
face-to-face interviews were conducted with Muslim married women
entrepreneurs operating home-based and market-based small businesses.

Findings

The findings show that all these three types of married women
entrepreneurs are active in the entrepreneurial process. However, the
authors found different paradoxes in their EI and desire for business
growth based on their marriage choices or marriage-related constraints
that may have been imposed on them.

Research limitations/implications

Qualitative research on a small sample size certainly presents a
limitation on the generalizability of this work, because it is difficult
to capture data regarding this sensitive issue. Future research could
also be carried out in other cultural and religious traditions.

Social implications

The paper provides good insights to understand the entrepreneurial
journey of Muslim women entrepreneurs in the conservative society based
on their marriages options.

Originality/value

The contribution of this research is twofold. First, the paper offers a
theoretical perspective related to female EI and business growth based
on religious marriages. Second, it applies Ajzen’s (2002) planned
behaviour theory to establish how marriage constraints may influence
women EI in the Muslim society.

Introduction

Research interest regarding female entrepreneurship has been growing
(Marlow and McAdam, 2013; Marlow et al., 2009) as the number of women
entrepreneurs increases significantly and women-owned businesses
continue to impact employment creation and the growth of local economies
(Verheul et al., 2006). Women play an increasingly productive role in
entrepreneurship throughout the globe, and as the field continues to
grow and mature, there are increasingly calls for scholars to expand
their research in this direction. Previous research related to women
entrepreneurs has provided insights into how women react
entrepreneurially based on motivation and intention (Ahl, 2006) and
their business activities in different sectors (Paoloni and Demartini,
2016). Entrepreneurial intentions (EI) include personal perceptions with
respect to the supportiveness of a given society, the business
environment and one’s own abilities (Bird, 2002). However, EI of women
in a Muslim society, where their marriages choices may have an impact,
have not been well understood. No previous research has been undertaken
to explore how Muslim society marriages influence women’s intentions
towards entrepreneurship.

In the Muslim society, three types of marriages are being practised,
namely, arranged, forced and love (Qureshi, 1991). How these marriages
affect EI and business success has not been addressed. The EI of Muslim
women entrepreneurs is assessed with reference to Ajzen’s (2002) theory
of planned behaviour (TPB) using personal attraction or attitude,
perceived behavioural control (PBC) and subjective norms (SN) in
relation to these three types of marriages which influence their
intentions and motivation for entrepreneurship. Furthermore, we are
interested that how their life partners play a role in the business
growth and how personal and societal constraints hamper future business
growth strategy of these women entrepreneurs. Thus, the three research
questions are developed. These are: RQ1. What is the influence of these
marriages (forced, arranged and love) on Muslim women EI towards
business start-up?RQ2. How is business growth being achieved based on
these marriages?RQ3. How might personal and societal constraints hamper
future business strategy?

We believe this study contributes to entrepreneurship knowledge in a
number of ways and has important theoretical and practical implications
for entrepreneurship literature. First, the paper contributes to an
understanding of how Muslim society marriages influence the EI of female
entrepreneurs and their intentionality. Whilst several previous studies
have invoked Ajzen’s (2002) TPB, for example, hygiene, nutrition,
physical activity and work or school behaviour (Steinmetz et al., 2016),
to date research regarding EI of Muslim married women with reference to
Ajzen’s (2002) TPB is undocumented. Second, the research draws attention
to the three types of women entrepreneurs in terms of commonalities and
unique characteristics. Third, data of this nature being scarce and hard
to obtain, this paper itself could offer a unique perspective and
contribution entrepreneurship literature.

This paper is organized as follows: a brief review of literature is
followed by a research methodology and findings. The discussion,
conclusion and research limitations and suggestions for future research
are then presented accordingly.

Literature review

Entrepreneurial intention

There has always been some degree of belief that intentionality exists
at the core of human agency. Husserl (1960) defined intentionality as
the fundamental property of consciousness. In focussing on EI
literature, the intention is understood to be the quality that leads an
individual to pursue a career in self-employment or establish his or her
own businesses (Fayolle and Liñán, 2014). Intentions are still
considered as the best single predictor of human behaviour (Krueger et
al., 2000). Robinson et al. (2007) definition of an entrepreneur as one
who “creates something of value and then assumes the risk of building a
business around it” points to three key components, namely, innovation,
risk and implementation. With regard to entrepreneurial intention,
various research works exist (Gielnik et al., 2015; Kautonen et al.,
2015; Obschonka et al., 2015; Rauch and Hulsink, 2015; Reuel Johnmark et
al., 2016) confirming that the success or failure of a new venture is
heavily influenced by entrepreneurial intention (Van Gelderen et al.,
2008; Paoloni and Demartini, 2016).

The entrepreneurial literature also groups EI into two categories (Bird,
1998). First, let us say internal category, as it is inextricably linked
to the person as individual, consists of demographics, personality
traits, psychological characteristics, individual skills and prior
knowledge, individual network and social ties. Second, more external
category, encompasses environmental support, environmental influences
and organizational factors.

With regard to the demographic factors, specifically related to gender,
researchers noted significant differences between male and female
entrepreneurs (Reynolds et al., 2002; Boyd, 1990). Pertaining to
personality traits, key aspects affecting EI were found to be confidence
(Busenitz, 1999) and optimism (Cooper et al., 1988). Psychological
factors include need for achievement (McClelland, 1961), risk-taking
propensity (Stewart and Roth, 2001), locus of control (Rotter, 1966) and
individual skills (Aldrich, 1999).

Regarding environmental support, Aldrich (1999) also alluded to the
entrepreneur’s personal network. Environment influence (Wiklund, 1999)
and organizational factors more relevant to the promotion of
entrepreneurship within an existing organization (Covin and Slevin,
1988) have also been studied. It is noted that entrepreneurial
activities can also influence the surrounding environment (Fini et al.,
2009). Indeed, business activities differ across the countries, not just
due to geographical factors, but more to cultural differences (Minkov
and Hofstede, 2012). One dimension of cultural difference appears
particularly relevant, namely, individualist → a culture that encourages
freedom and personal fulfilment or collectivist → the incorporation of
individuals into a larger group, stimulating loyalty, respect for
superiors and disdain for individuals who might venture to stand out
(Hofstede, 1991).

In this research where women entrepreneurs seek to start businesses in a
conservative society, these influences are most certainly relevant. The
uniqueness of their personality traits, psychological characteristics,
skills, prior knowledge, environmental support and environmental
influences creates a compelling case for deeper research. These factors
play an important role in EI, particularly psychological characteristics
have a greater influence on entrepreneurial start-up intentions
(Ferreira et al., 2012). In fact, the stream of start-up intention can
be linked with the TPB model in the literature.

According to Ajzen’s (1991) study, intentions are determined by SN, a
person’s attitudes and PBC. His TPB has achieved a significant place in
the entrepreneurship literature. The model was first used for measuring
EI by Krueger and Carsrud (1993). According to the model, behavioural
intention (BI) is defined as “a measure of the strength of one’s
intention to perform a specified behaviour” (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975,
p. 288). For entrepreneurial studies, BI is referred to as EI,
representing the conscious goal of becoming an entrepreneur (Wilson et
al., 2007). A rich literature of entrepreneurship focusses on the
intention→behaviour of entrepreneurs at three distinct phases of
entrepreneurship, namely, prior to the start-up based on several
constraints, during the business function and future intentions for
portfolio entrepreneurs (Mergemeier et al., 2018).

EI and its association with entrepreneurial behaviour have become a
pervasive theme. Krueger et al. (2000) argue that (in its simplest form)
while intentions predict behaviour, some specific attitudes predict
intention. Hence, attitude serves as a means towards a better
understanding of behaviour (Ajzen, 1991; Kim and Hunter, 1993). At the
same time, Krueger et al. (2000) argue that since both intentions and
attitudes are perception based, both are subjective across individuals
and different situations and that it is therefore possible for both to
be taught and learned.

Approaching behaviour purely through intention, Ajzen (1991) concludes
that the stronger the intention to engage in a given behaviour, the more
likely will be its performance. Performance though requires one’s
volitional control over the behaviour, i.e. ones freedom to choose
whether or not to engage in such behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). In determining
the intention itself, Ajzen proposed three independent antecedents,
namely, attitude towards the behaviour, SN and PBC. Attitude towards the
behaviour refers to one’s own perceptions, sentiments and appraisals
towards the behaviour in question, including an evaluation on how
favourable and valued the behaviour itself is. SN focusses on the social
factors and refers to the perceived social pressure or support
experienced around the behaviour. PBC refers to one’s personal beliefs
about the ease or difficulty of performing the behaviour in question.
Together these interacting antecedents can either strengthen or weaken
the individual’s intention to perform the behaviour in question.

The TPB, as introduced by Ajzen (1991), has been variously applied in,
for example, predicting physical activity in corporate employees
(Kimiecik, 1992), predicting lifestyle changes among adolescents (Morgan
and Grube, 1994) and attitudes towards consuming organically produced
vegetables (Sparks and Shepherd, 1992). Within an entrepreneurial
context, TPB has been applied to assessing venture creation behaviour in
Latin America (Guzmán-Alfonso and Guzmán-Cuevas, 2012) as well as in
Finland (Kautonen et al., 2013).

In this research, Muslim women entrepreneurs, who have established small
home-based and market-based businesses in rural areas, are studied to
determine how an EI was developed prior to launching these businesses
and how such intention influences business success. Whilst several
success factors regarding women entrepreneurs have been identified,
namely, skill level, competency, whether gained educationally or by
experience (Cabrera and Mauricio, 2017), the influence of family ties
(Cesaroni and Paoloni, 2016) and work→life balance with particular
regard to family (Cesaroni et al., 2018), the focus of this study was to
determine how Muslim society marriages (whether forced, arranged or
love) may influence the EI of Muslim female entrepreneurs and impact on
business success and failure.

Muslim women marriages options

In Muslim culture, marriage is an alliance or contractual agreement,
whether written or unwritten, between families, rather than between two
individuals (Qureshi, 1991). This concept illustrates the norm of
familialism or interconnectedness, in which interdependent social
relationships are considered primary and greater than other
relationships (Chaudhary, 2017; Dion and Dion, 1996). Whilst there are
norms around marriage practices and principles in every religion, those
in the western society allow both male and female the right to choose a
partner. Conversely, in Muslim society, when it is felt that the
appropriate times have arrived for a young man or female to marry, a key
decision-making member of the family, most often a female (e.g. mother
and grandmother) will start her search for the best possible prospect
and the final decision must gain the endorsement of the father (Korson,
1971). As was mentioned earlier, three types of marriages are common in
Muslim society, namely, arranged marriages, forced marriages and love
marriages. Each of these is now briefly discussed.

The arranged marriage is dependent on familial background, education and
social class. It will be progressively built upon a range of connections
with prospective spouse’s families. Qureshi (1991) informs that three
types of arranged marriages are common: the planned type, where parents
plan the entire process and consider many family and community
variables; the delegation, where males tell their parents what types of
life partner they want and parents try to meet those conditions; and the
joint venture type, where parents and children together actively take
part in the spouse selection process. The forced marriages occur where
neither male nor female is willing, i.e. there is no spousal consent,
but their parents of both parties insist on the union. Research has been
undertaken around the phenomenon of forced marriages in a bid to argue
any ethical pitfalls perceived in this approach (Uddin and Ahmad, 2000).
Marriages of choice or love, though currently on the increase in Muslim
society, remain less prominent and often unwelcomed than the other two.
In all these three types of marriages family members play a crucial
role.

Cesaroni and Paoloni’s (2016) typology of family profiles propose five
types. These are: family as an obligation; family as a support; family
as an opportunity; family as a generational continuity; and family as a
form of giving up. Their study shows the different roles that women
perform within families, i.e. mother, wife, daughter, significantly
influence their business experiences. It is clear that the context
represented by married Muslim women entrepreneurs is demanding, as in
all three types of marriages, women have to establish a relationship
with their life partner as well as all other members of the family. Such
relationship also influences business growth.

Business growth

In the context of women entrepreneurship literature, the progression of
small business growth is reliant on numerous tangible and intangible
resources (Muhammad et al., 2017). Researchers and academic scholars
have proposed three determinants of small business growth. According to
Westhead and Storey (1996), business growth depends on the
characteristics of the firm, the characteristics of the entrepreneur and
the strategy for the growth. Furthermore, different growth models have
been proposed to define stages of small business growth (Dobbs and
Hamilton, 2007). However, to provide a rich perspective of small
business growth, Wiklund et al. (2009) proposed big picture models based
on five perspectives: entrepreneurial orientation and small business
growth; the environment and small business growth; strategic fit and
small business growth; resources and small business growth; and growth
attitude and small business growth.

Entrepreneurship literature has thus provided a strong association
between EI and business growth. In the Muslim society, women are
generally unable to access the same opportunities as men due to the
culture, values, religion and tradition (Roomi and Parrott, 2008). In
Pakistan, many problems faced by women entrepreneurs can be seen as a
result of the status of women in their culture (Roomi, 2006). According
to Shabbir and Di Gregorio (1996) and Al-Hibri (1982), the types of
challenges women entrepreneurs face in Pakistan are “purdah” (Veil) and
“Izzat” (Respect) which restricts them from many things like going out
and working with men. The major challenge that women have to face when
considering to start their own business is that of family
responsibilities. As any business requires attention and time, this
often conflicts with family responsibilities of women, thus the success
of the business may be undermined (Jennings and McDougald, 2007). One of
the core issues is their decision surrounding life partner selection,
which is often imposed on them. Such an imposition will therefore
significantly influence their EI and the growth of their businesses.

To sum up the theoretical context of this research, it explores the EI
of Muslim women with reference to Ajzen’s (2002) TPB by applying three
antecedents. Attitude towards the behavioural or personal attraction
refers to financial rewards, independence, autonomy, personal rewards
and family security → all of which do influence EI (Ajzen, 2005). PBC
which is related to individual belief and self-confidence in his/her
competency in performing as an entrepreneurs and realizing control and
success in entrepreneurial activity which is also called self-efficacy
(Bandura, 1997) and SN which is related to how connected group such as
family, friends and society think about entrepreneurial behaviour
whether they accept or reject (Armitage and Conner, 2001).

This study attempts to unfold these behaviours by identifying the
similarities and differences among these women entrepreneurs based on
marriages (forced, love and arranged). Additionally, how life partners
play a role in their businesses success and support them to surmount
personal and societal constraints which affect their business strategy
substantially. To achieve these research questions, considerable
attention was given to the design of a specific research methodology
that could facilitate the soliciting of data regarding these sensitive
issues surrounding the lived experiences of participants, resulting in
the use of a phenomenological approach being used (Valentine et al.,
2018; Easterby-Smith et al., 2015; Cavana et al., 2001), as further
discussed.

Methodology

A qualitative approach was used for this research due to four basic
reasons. First, a qualitative research methodology can be used when data
cannot be quantified (Creswell, 2013). Second, qualitative research
allows detailed insights to be gained into the real-life experiences of
the respondents (Hoepfl, 1997). Third, a qualitative method enables the
capturing of varied experiences of the respondents belonging to
different backgrounds (Cacciotti et al., 2016). Fourth, the research
questions developed for this paper are subjective in nature, possibly
even unique to an individual’s circumstances. Women entrepreneurs in our
study were categorized into three distinct groups according to their
type of marriage, whether “forced”, “arranged” or “love”. Given that the
collection of data related to marriage issues is challenging, special
care was taken to ensure the confidentiality of these women
entrepreneurs. Furthermore, it was necessary to build trust between the
researchers and each participant, so as to be able to delve in some
depth into very private matters.

Owing to the nature of this research, a phenomenological inquiry was
decided (Valentine et al., 2018). Phenomenology, being a social
constructionist research paradigm, holds the view that an individual’s
reality is constructed socially. It is manifest by their subjective
lived experiences, rather than objectively determined (Easterby-Smith et
al., 2015; Cavana et al., 2001). This approach provided in-depth
insights into respondents personal life experience related to marriages
options and how such options are influencing their EI and behaviour.

Procedure

In keeping with the phenomenological aim of in-depth study to uncover
detailed personal accounts (Huberman and Miles, 2002; Patton, 2002), a
small yet purposeful sample of participants was sought. The sampling
frame for this research was married women who started their home-based
and market-based businesses in the province of Khyber Pakthunkawa,
Pakistan. A semi-structured interview protocol was constructed,
providing clear instructions for interviewers to collect reliable,
comparable qualitative data (see Bryman, 2006; Povee and Roberts, 2015).
Interview questions were prepared ahead related to the themes for the
interviews (Irvine et al., 2013). Semi-structured interviews enable
researchers to probe for more information and clarification of answers
(Bartholomew et al., 2000). This approach was appropriate in this
research as the experiences, perception and opinions of married women
entrepreneurs were sensitive.

The study used face-to-face and telephonic interviews of women
participants with a view to gaining a detailed understanding of their
respective perceptions and experiences regarding their marriages and
their impact on EI and business growth. Before launching the interview
process, a set of core interview questions were prepared for all
respondents, based on the following themes: Theme 1 → business start-up
intentions and how these intentions were associated with the perspective
of marriages. Theme 2 → based on these intentions how business growth
was influenced and how they categorize business growth based on their
marriages influences and EI. Theme 3 → their personal and societal
constraints which hamper their future business strategy.

The interview process

In recognition that the research being undertaken regarding women
entrepreneurs includes sensitive cultural issues, rendering it difficult
to obtain data from participants, two female researchers were trained to
conduct the interviews. Due to the sensitivity, finding respondents was
a major challenge. Women networks were used as the starting point to
make initial contact with a few women entrepreneurs who are already in
businesses. Prospects were assured that their identity would not be
revealed at any point of the research project. After obtaining the
willingness of four early participants, the two female researchers
conduct the interviews at each of the participant’s houses. Further
participants were located using the snowball sampling techniques
(Biernacki and Waldorf, 1981). Whilst a total of 30 women entrepreneurs
were selected, 5 were later omitted because it turned out they were not
married and a further 5 declined to participate in the research for
personal reasons, resulting in a total of 20 interviews. Of these, 7
women entrepreneurs belonged to storefront businesses and 13 were
home-based businesses. All 20 participants were from the Pakistan
province of Khyber Pakthunkawa, a conflict environment for the past
decade (Muhammad et al., 2016), and a province where strict marriage
laws apply, rendering it difficult for women in this province to choose
a love marriage. Notwithstanding the community norms, in a total of 20
interviews, 3 respondents were in forced marriages, 4 respondents were
in love marriages and 13 respondents were in arranged marriages. Table I
shows the demographic characteristics and their marriages status.

In total, 18 interviews were taken face-to-face and 2 interviews were
taken over the phone. As expected, questions about marriage history
elicited guarded responses. Four women in love marriages were notably
more comfortable in responding, those in arranged marriages next, but
those in forced marriages did not initially admit that their marriages
were forced, though it became clear as the interview progressed. The
interviews were electronically recorded with the permission of
participants and they were assured about the confidentiality of their
information.

Data analysis

The recorded interviews were transcribed for analysis. The data were
then translated from Urdu and Pashto to English before coding.
Initially, the transcribed data were thoroughly read again and again by
the researchers for the identification research themes and the
corresponding application of coding. Thematic analysis was used for
identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within data (Braun et al.,
2019). The most commonly occurring fundamental themes that occurred
frequently across the data were identified. Basic themes identified in
this way became the fundamental themes of the research. Data within
these fundamental themes were then organized into the sub-themes. Any of
the initial fundamental themes that were found to be uncommon across the
data were not pursued further. Finally, themes portraying a common idea
or principle were clustered together to form main themes. These emerged
as: EI; business growth; and future strategy.

Findings

Using the thematic analysis approach, the following main themes and
sub-themes are elicited from the data, as depicted in Table II.

Entrepreneurial intention

The main theme of EI comprises the following sub-themes.

Background factors

The business intentions based on background factors of these women
entrepreneurs portray family circumstances whereby their intentions are
based on business-oriented family background, i.e. necessity-driven
entrepreneurship. In these instances, both the pull (towards wealth
creation) and push (away from poverty) motives were observed. The
contexts of forced and arranged marriage women are similar to each other
but different in nature as compared to love marriage category
background. One respondent whose marriage was forced stated “I started
this business because I belong to a business-oriented family and I was
optimistic that I could do a better business”. Another woman
entrepreneur from the same category responded: “My intention for this
business was related to a poor condition of my family and I want to do
something better in my life and I am struggling for it, but by the grace
of Allah one day I will achieve it”. One woman from arranged marriage
acknowledged “My daughter used to run this business, but after her
(arranged) marriage, she handed over to me and I run the business
successfully”.

However, in the category of love marriage, it was observed that they did
not link their entrepreneurial start-up towards the family background,
but their EI emerged due to the necessity-driven entrepreneurship and a
willingness to cooperate with life partners. A woman who is in a love
marriage category replied “After my marriage, I realized that my husband
can’t run the house by himself. Thus, I wanted to help him and I started
this small business”.

Psychological factors

In this sub-theme, it became clear that psychological factors are
related to their EI. For example, one respondent from forced marriage
expressed her confusion: “Before starting this business, I was confused
because I wanted to do something in my life, initially I was stressed
and was thinking what happened to me, but due to the passage of time I
have changed and feel better now and trying to achieve my goal”. Another
female entrepreneur from an arranged marriage expressed “After my
marriage, I was getting bored and wanted to do something that is why I
started this business because I didn’t want to become just a housewife”.
Furthermore, illustrating the psychological factors, one woman
entrepreneur from love marriage stated “when I was looking to my husband
he was doing a hard job and I wanted to help him, that’s why I started
this business”. The EI of respondents developed through different
psychological factors. Essentially, some are related to co-operation
with partners and some are indicative of from marriage stress.

The majority of interviewees motivated towards entrepreneurship based on
psychological factors expressed the desire for independence or the need
for some form of autonomy or freedom, an accomplishment in their life, a
sense of personal development or a need to take control over their
lives. An exception was that, those in the love marriage category,
showed a desire to succeed in their businesses in an effort to support
their husbands in building familial wealth and success. The authors find
it an interesting paradox that those more constrained by the marriage
type appeared to be using business as a way of gaining some autonomy,
while those less-constrained by their marriage type were motivated to
support their husbands.

Gender issues

Interviewees expressed perspectives of gender issues as relating to
deep-seated cultural tradition. Some discussed how, as women, they
sometimes experience societal discrimination. Deep concerns were
expressed regarding the ways in which women’s abilities and
contributions may sometimes appear to be underestimated in their
culture. For example, one woman from a forced marriage stated “you know
very well that in our society women are not treated very well and I
wanted to do something better than my husband to convince him that I can
do something in my life”. Another woman from arranged marriage said
“When you want to start a business all people in our society will say to
you that you are a woman and you can’t do this […] I realized to stop
their mouths let’s do something”. Somewhat contrastingly, one woman from
a love marriage expressed “Women can do a lot of great jobs in their
life, but most of the women in our society underestimate themselves”.

The research confirms that gender differences exist in this society and
that this serves to reduce the EI of women. However, it also uncovered
some motivations to prove equivalence to men, a sort of passive
aggressive response to gender issues. It seems love marriage women
entrepreneurs have more courage and motivation to challenge societal
norms in a more positive way, using the opportunity to inspire others,
and not under-estimating themselves.

Future security

The EI of the respondents were also associated with future security in
terms of monetary value and to avoid being dominated by their partners.
The majority of these women had children and wanted a secured career
that would allow them to balance their duties towards their kids with
their personal career aspirations. For example, a respondent from forced
marriage expressed her view as follows: “Initially I was taking money
from my husband and whenever I said to him I need a money he didn’t look
very happy from this demand, thus I was thinking that anytime he can
stop the money, therefore, for the future safety I started this
business”. A woman from arranged marriage stated “To save money it is
very important for my kids”. Expressing the future security for a
business start-up one respondent from a love marriage stated: “I think
business is very important because anything can happen anytime and it
will be very difficult for my husband to survive without my support”.

These statements indicate a common intent regarding future security,
namely, to contribute to the security of the family unit. However, women
entrepreneurs in forced marriages also linked EI to their personal
security.

Business growth

After the EI, we are interested that how these marriages and husbands
support influence their business growth. It emerged that all marriages
(forced, arranged and love marriages) and husbands support have both
positive and negative influence on their business growth. We constructed
three sub-themes regarding business growth. These are positive
influence, negative influence and growth trajectory.

Positive influence

Regarding a positive influence, one woman entrepreneur in the category
of forced marriage stated “Running a business while being married is
better” and further stated “My husband supports me very much while
before marriage there was no one to support me as such in the home”.
Another woman entrepreneur from the same marriage category states “My
marriage was forced and I started this business because I wanted to
become independent, my husband supports me because he loves me but
before marriage my choice was different”. A woman from arranged marriage
said, “If you have a good understanding with your partner and you do
anything in your life you will be a successful person, this is why my
business is growing”. These positive influences are mostly related to
mutual co-operation with their partners. Extending the positive
influence of these marriages, a woman in the category of love marriage
acknowledged (sic) “I did love marriage, and I am very happy from my
decision, because such decision has a positive influence on my business
growth, initially I was making soup at home and my husband was selling
it in bazaar (market), now I started a clothing business and my husband
cooperate me a lot”.

Negative influence

The highest negative influence on business growth was expressed by those
women entrepreneurs who are in the category of forced marriages. For
example, one respondent said, “Before my marriage, I was also doing the
same business, but when I became married I experienced tension and
couldn’t give concentration to my business and this is why I am not
happy with the existing growth of my business”. However, one woman
entrepreneur in the category of arranged marriage said “To maintain your
kids and marriage is very difficult when you do business”. Furthermore,
a respondent from a love marriage gave very interesting arguments
regarding negative influences “when my husband is not at home I do not
feel safe and can’t give concentration to my business”. One apparent
negative effect of a forced marriage is tension, which appeared to have
a continuous effect on the wife’s entrepreneurial spirit. Conversely
though, there were no apparent negative influences on business growth
expressed by women in love marriages.

Growth trajectories

In this theme, respondents acknowledge a variety of opinions regarding
business growth trajectory. Many of the women in arranged marriages
stated that starting a business was an attempt to cope with the
increases in the cost of living, but they also stated that without their
life partners assistance it would not have been viable for them to
launch such activities: “I launched this business because I needed it,
but I am satisfied that my business is okay, however, I would like to
say that my business is growing with the help of my husband”. On the
other hand, those women in love marriages were more satisfied with their
businesses as compared to other respondents. A woman from a love
marriage said of her business growth “My business is growing and it is
because of my sweet husband”. Another woman from the same category says
“Besides running a business I have responsibilities to look after my
kids, but still I am satisfied from my business and it is because of my
husband’s cooperation and understanding with him”. The business growth
and sense of satisfaction they derive there from were related to their
enhanced sense of self-esteem. Alternatively, women from the forced
marriage category underline different business growth trajectories “I
want to do something in my life, I started this business and I am
satisfied because my business is okay. My husband helps me but I do not
want to disturb him”. In this category, the growth was largely dependent
on the women’s own efforts, with little assistance from their husbands.
However, there are exceptions to this, as another woman from the same
category responded “My husband helps me a lot because he was interested
to do marriage with me and such assistant facilitates me to achieve
business growth”. There is a sense that women in this category may not
be as interested in receiving help from their husbands, and that such
help may sometimes be given without their desire.

Future strategy

In this main theme, the following sub-themes were identified:
self-independence, acquired resources, handle the community. Each of
these is now discussed.

Self-independence

Those women in forced marriages mostly stated that their future strategy
is to become an independent person. For example, one woman entrepreneur
from a forced marriage said “My first strategy regarding business growth
is to become self-independent first because I do not want to take help
from others”. Another woman from the category of arranged marriage
stated “My husband is very busy. I do take help from him but I do not
want to take this practice ongoing. I am interested to make myself
independent, which is very important for my business growth”.
Furthermore, one woman who is under the category of arranged marriage
stated “I really wanted to do something forever […] after I had kids I
thought I was wasting, and I am not doing anything […] I used to see
women around complaining about not having money, resources, harassment
from in-laws or husband and being dependent. It was the time I thought I
have to something and the only profession my husband allowed me to
pursue was teaching and I didn’t want to do a teaching, I didn’t have
the temperament for it, so I thought of doing something convenient that
I could start at home”. She started her business just to be independent
even though she was from a financially strong family as she mentioned “I
am married to a landlord”. This attitude towards future strategy
indicates the motive to grow a business in spite of limitations that may
be imposed by the spouse.

Another woman from love marriage said regarding self-independence “In my
view, self-independence means that you do not take help from other
people, but if I take assistance from my husband I do not consider that
I am not a self-independent person, my husband is everything for me, and
he is the key player of my business growth”. This portrays an intention
of self-independence, not out of frustration or need, but rather out of
love and companionship.

Acquired resources

All women entrepreneurs acknowledge the importance of resources, in
particular financial resources, in business growth. However, it seems
resources are valued in different ways depending on the type of
marriage. For example, a respondent from an arranged marriage stated “I
have no sufficient resources and my strategy to talk to other people to
invest in my business because it will facilitate me to achieve business
growth”. But a woman from forced marriage has different views regarding
resources “I think the most important resources for a business growth
are moral resources, because after my marriage I had all the required
resources but there was no proper understanding between me and my
husband, but after the passage of time we developed understanding, and I
am satisfied from my business”. The allusion to moral resources
indicates a recognition of the need for a sense of shared understanding
of what the business is all about. This, it seems, was particularly
difficult at the outset, and took a lot of effort due perhaps to a more
restrained nature of communication in the forced marriage. In contrast,
a love marriage entrepreneur stated “the biggest resources for my
business is my sweet husband because without him I can’t achieve
business growth”. This is indicative of a more supportive relationship
between spouses being beneficial to the future of the business.

Handle the society

In the Muslim society, women are often discouraged to do business,
particularly a storefront business. Respondents who were running
storefront businesses showed deep concern regarding such discouragement.
The majority of participants stated that even if they managed a
home-based business, people would say derogatory things about them. They
all seem to believe that their biggest challenge is to handle the
societal issues. For example, one woman from an arranged marriage said
“Whenever my husband comes to the house he is depressed because he said
several times to me that stop the business because in our society people
do not like that women working”. The same respondent further asked “Now
you think if this is the situation, so how I can achieve business growth
if your husband is always stressed?” Additionally, one woman
entrepreneur said, “I did love marriage, and I would like to say that we
did court marriage, still in the society people blame me that she is not
obedient to her parents (weeping) […] I am obedient, but currently, my
focus is to convince the society that the marriage I did my religion
also gives me this right what I did”. Throughout this theme, we found
that women entrepreneurs experience stress resulting from societal
conflict, with the effect that, besides striving to achieve the business
growth, they are also continuously struggling to deal with these
problems. On this issue there is no differentiation between the women’s
type of marriage.

Table III shows the similarities and differences between marriage types
in respect of EI, business growth and future strategy. The table also
presents a summary of how the marriage decision has an influence on
entrepreneurial processes, which ultimately affect entrepreneurial
success for female Muslim entrepreneurs.

Discussion

EI and business growth theories have achieved a significant focus of
academic scholars and practitioners. These theories have been discussed
in previous literature in different contexts, but there has been a lack
of research to relate these theories with Muslim women entrepreneurs.
James (2012) argues that research on women entrepreneurship needs to be
extended into novel directions. Bearing this in mind, this study has
striven to explore the influence of Muslim marriage choices of women
entrepreneurs’ on their EI towards business start-up. As discussed in
the introduction section, in the Muslim society, three marriages are
common: forced marriages, arranged marriages and love marriages.

Answering the overarching questions of this study, the data were
collected from women entrepreneurs who fall under the above described
three categories of marriages. Their entrepreneurial history based on
the influence of these marriages is different and we found paradoxes in
their life stories. The three research questions were developed: RQ1.
What is the influence of marriages (forced, arranged and love) on EI
towards start-up?RQ2. How business growth is being achieved based on
these marriages?RQ3. How might personal and societal constraints hamper
their future business strategy?

With reference to Ajzen’s (2002) TPB , we found diverse behavioural
differences in these women entrepreneurs. Their EI were determined by
attitude towards the behaviour or personal attraction; PBC; and SN.
According to Ajzen (2005), attitude towards the behaviour or personal
attraction refers to the degree to which the person holds an overall
positive or negative personal valuation about being an entrepreneur.
Ajzen (2005) argues that people develop an attitude based on the beliefs
they hold about the consequences of performing the behaviour. Such
consequences include both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards as financial
rewards, independence/autonomy, personal rewards and family security,
all of which do influence favourably the intention to launch a business
(Choo and Wong, 2006; Vanevenhoven and Liguori, 2013). Linking these
behaviours to the first research question of the present study, forced
marriages women having entirely different perception as compared to the
other two categories. Their EI for business start-up were associated to
insecurity, stress and family instability which motivate them for EI.
Additionally, these women always desired for independence in their life
and no intention to become parasitic on others even their life partners.
Alternately, love marriage women portray different pictures, their EI
were rooted on to facilitate their husbands by sharing financial
responsibilities with them and are desperate to win the trust and love
of their partners. Moreover, they look for both intrinsic and extrinsic
rewards and these intentions provide a smooth direction towards for an
entrepreneurial success and emancipation. On the other hand, arranged
marriages women having no solid directions for a start-up, but mostly
they focussed to look after their kids and to restrain them from
financial constraints. In addition, family burden, time pressure,
parental demand and to support husband have diverse level of influence
which affects their entrepreneurial success and deter their attention to
scan for more opportunities.

Ajzen (2002) reported that PBC refers to the individual’s belief and
self-confidence in his/her competency in performing as an entrepreneur
and realizing control and success in entrepreneurial activity. Such
entrepreneurial activity is also called self-efficacy which refers to
greater self-efficacy influences entrepreneurial behaviour. Connecting
PBC, the findings of this study reflect that forced marriages women have
the high level of self-efficacy which influences their entrepreneurial
behaviour. Correspondingly, instability and life-stress based on forced
marriage also accelerate their confidence and capability to act as
entrepreneurs which in result leads to a strong EI (Bandura, 1989,
1997). These findings support previous research on the link between
entrepreneurial self-efficacy and EI (Kourilsky and Walstad, 1998;
Eccles, 1994). On the other hand, love marriages women having the same
tendency towards self-efficacy, but their start-up intention is to
cooperate with their life partners. Furthermore, their love relationship
also boosts a prosperous life for themselves and their kids. Several
entrepreneurship theorists have proposed that self-efficacy plays an
essential role in the formation of a new venture (Boyd and Vozikis,
1994; Scherer et al., 1989). Nevertheless, this study adds new insights
to the existing literature that how self-efficacy enhances with a strong
relationship between husband and wife which motivate them for more
entrepreneurial opportunities and business success. Finally, the
self-efficacy of arranged marriage women is based on to fulfil the
requirements of their kids and such necessity motivates them to launch a
venture, but comparatively, their self-efficacy is not stronger as
compared to forced and love marriage women entrepreneurs. This is due to
more family responsibilities besides running the businesses which in
result diminishing their motivation towards self-efficacy.

In the context of entrepreneurship literature, SN refer to the
perception of what a person’s reference or connected group such as
family, friends or significant others would think about carrying out an
entrepreneurial behaviour or whether they accept or reject the
entrepreneurial decision (Armitage and Conner, 2001). Connecting SN to
this study, we found that this perception is common in all three types
of marriages, namely, forced, arranged and love marriages. They
acknowledged that in the surrounding society their entrepreneurial
behaviour is not encouraged by others. Furthermore, they realized that
they are underestimated by the society. However, love marriage women do
not give any concentration to these perceptions and are fully motivated
towards entrepreneurial activities.

The subsequent research question was allied with how business growth is
being achieved based on these marriages which mean how their life
partners play a role in the business growth. The findings of this study
revealed that the prevailing business conditions of these women are
stable up to some extent except for some dissatisfaction pointed out by
few respondents. Throughout the history of entrepreneurial research,
there have been many attempts to categorize business growth to a variety
of variables. These categories have included industry, size, region,
age, capital (labour) intensity, high- or low-technology, stage of life
cycle, gender, personality type and numerous others (Wiklund et al.,
2009). However, in this study, a particular stream of research has
developed that has attempted to categorize or differentiate business
growth and failure by linking marriages choices of Muslim women
entrepreneurs where the present literature is deficient. The findings of
this study examine the growth intentions, commitment level and
opportunity-seeking behaviour based on their marriages choices that may
distinguish these businesses from other businesses have been discussed
in the literature.

This study determines that those women in arranged marriages were
satisfied with the existing business condition, and they acknowledged a
partial support from their husband. This growth is based on dependency
growth. Alternatively, with those women in love marriages, business
growth was related to self-esteem and combined effort because both wife
and husband cooperate with each other in a common goal which could be
named mutual intention and business growth. Finally, those women in
forced marriages had their EI and business growth grounded on
self-independence. In this, two paradoxes were uncovered. First, some
women entrepreneurs did not set out with intention to accept assistance
from their husbands, but whose husbands did then cooperate with them
which is up to some extent called unexpected growth. Second, some women
have developed more self-confidence through starting their business and
now strive to achieve business success without needing moral assistance
in the shape of life partners.

The results regarding the impact of marriages on business success and
failure show that the start-up of these women entrepreneurs is highly
influenced by marriages because their husbands play a key role in
business success and failure. For any business motivation and desire for
growth depend upon several dimensions. The literature of small business
growth identified several antecedents of growth for women entrepreneurs
(Chandran and Aleidi, 2019), but in the context of this research, the
antecedents of growth are different which is also called a kind of
intangible support (El Ebrashi, 2018). Our findings conclude that family
support plays an essential role in the growth of small business where we
found substantial evidence in this research. Nevertheless, respondents
in forced marriages are avoiding husband support because they desire for
independence and high need for achievement ambition (McClelland, 1966).
These findings conclude that business growth also depends upon the
psychological perception which was evidenced by forced marriages
respondents where we found paradoxes in their responses regarding
business success and failure.

The findings regarding our third research question which is how personal
and societal constraints might hamper future business strategy. Many of
these women are inhibited in scanning for new opportunities due to a
constant anxiety regarding how society is judging them. They acknowledge
that society is not generally supportive of their business start-up.
This in turn fuels family stress and may even weaken the relationship
with their life partner. Forced marriage women have to contend with this
whilst also struggling to achieve a measure of self-independence from
their husbands. It is clear that, even though Muslim women are
discouraged to do business, they do exert a mental toughness or resolve
that can motivate them towards entrepreneurial success. There remains at
work a complex interplay between the conservative society and these
women entrepreneurs, which is characterized by discrimination and
discouragement. Moreover, regarding their future strategy for growth, it
was observed that these women face personal and societal constraints
which hamper their future growth strategy substantially. In terms of
personal constraints, they need resources in terms of investment to map
their future business strategy productively. The most crucial
constraints they face are related to an environment where they are
discouraged to do businesses. Such constraint is the key obstacle for
them and it seems difficult for them to surmount, because environmental
influence plays an essential role for the business success (Fini et al.,
2009; Wiklund, 1999).

Conclusion

The study provides empirical evidence about the influence of Muslim
society marriages on their EI and business success. The EI of a small
sample of married women entrepreneurs in Pakistan were discussed with
reference to Ajzen’s (2002) TPB. The theory provided insights regarding
personal attraction for the business start-up, PBC and SN. This study
found that women in forced marriages can be highly motivated towards
entrepreneurship, being keen to achieve self-independence, with a high
need for achievement (McClelland, 1965), whilst concurrently handling
family problems with internal locus of control (Rotter, 1966).
Nevertheless, we found that those women entrepreneurs experienced
significant psychological stress in coping with the dual
responsibilities of their family commitments and business activities.
Women in arranged marriages were also motivated for entrepreneurship but
their primary focus remained with the family. On the other hand, women
in love marriages seemed to enjoy a more relaxed approach to business,
with positive reinforcement from their life partners. Furthermore, love
marriage women have a high level of self-efficacy and a desire to
cooperate with husbands and share responsibilities with them.

Linking this study with reference to Ajzen’s (2002) theory
differentiated these women in terms of personal attraction, PBC and SN.
It shows that Muslim society marriages highly influence the EI of women
entrepreneurs and perform a significant role in business success and
failure. Additionally, this study shows how women entrepreneurs respond
to, or cope with, the environment and the personal or societal
constraints that might be expected to hinder their entrepreneurial
future strategy.

This research may be useful for future female entrepreneurs who
experience similar challenges yet remain motivated to engage in
entrepreneurial activity. The research, though based on Muslim married
woman, may also be useful for policy-makers of other cultural and
religious persuasions.

Limitations of the study and directions for future research

Although, this study provides a deeper understanding of the influence of
Muslim society marriages on women EI and their experiences regarding
forced, arranged and love marriages, the research design of this study
is not without limitations. First, the number of respondents for this
research was low. While this is in keeping with phenomenological
tradition, it also reflects the difficulties of locating respondents
regarding this sensitive issue. Whilst we believe this study has
produced significant findings, the generalization of those remains
somewhat limited by the sample size. Second, only one province, Khyber
Pakthunkawa, was represented in this research. Whilst this province is a
good reflection for the scope of this study, being one where women
entrepreneurs do face several cultural issues, perhaps more difficult to
surmount due to the conflict in the zone and the strictness of Muslim
tradition there, we concede that the omission of other provinces affects
the generalizations of our findings. Third, only one country was
selected for the study. These marriages practices are common in several
Muslim countries and it is possible that women entrepreneurs may be
impacted differently there. Fourth, only three respondents represented
the forced marriage group and were reluctant to share their in-depth
life experiences. Fifth, the actual data were not collected by the
authors of the paper. To overcome cultural sensitivities, female
researchers were trained to collect data from respondents. Efforts were
made to impart expertise regarding data collection but it is possible
that certain nuances among participants may have been missed by the
authors.

Given the limited research on this matter, further research is needed to
improve understanding of how the experiences of Muslim women
entrepreneurs are being affected by their marriage type. Similar
research could also be carried out in other provinces of Pakistan, such
as Baluchistan, Punjab and Sindh. Moreover, future research could be
carried out in the western cultural settings that assess how marriage
choices and other family ties, as investigated by Cesaroni and Paoloni
(2016), influence EI. Such new research will facilitate comparisons
between Muslim and non-Muslim traditions, as related to
entrepreneurship. Also, to examine the role of female entrepreneurs in
different businesses background well documented by Cesaroni et al.
(2017) where the authors provide a comprehensive avenue for researchers
to conduct research in women entrepreneurship performing different
businesses and how they respond to the environment. Furthermore, based
on Hofstede’s (2001) observations that Indonesia, Pakistan and Iran
share a common religion, it would be interesting to expand this study to
other countries where the religion is predominantly Muslim.

Satellite entrepreneurs plan astronomical growth

A pair of British entrepreneurs have minted paper fortunes of nearly $1
billion each since launching their space venture on to the US stock
market this month.

David Williams and

David Bestwick

listed Arqit Quantum on the Nasdaq exchange through a merger with a
blank cheque company.

The company has caught the attention of risk-hungry investors with its
claim that satellites can be used to protect corporate IT systems from
the most sophisticated cyber attacks.

Despite having negligible revenues, shares in Arqit have more than
doubled since the company went public, lifting its market value to $3.4
billion.

Williams, 52, and Bestwick, 55, own stakes of 27 per cent and 24 per
cent in the London-based business. At Friday's closing price of $24.24,
their holdings were worth $920 million and $816 million.

The UK taxpayer is sitting on a paper profit of nearly £100 million from
Arqit's flotation, according to Williams, the chief executive.

The Future Fund

invested £8.5 million in the company last year through loans that
convert into shares.

Williams, a former J P Morgan banker, founded Arqit in early 2017 after
he quit

Avanti Communications

, then a listed satellite operator.

He and Bestwick established Avanti in 2007 and the company became a
stock market darling for a time, before an industry sell-off decimated
its share price five years ago. Avanti, which had borrowed heavily to
launch satellites, subsequently fell into the hands of creditors, who
took the company off the stock market in 2019.

Williams said he came up with the idea for Arqit while working with
Avanti's customers in the defence industry and intelligence services. He
said that advances in computing power were weakening legacy encryption
systems, which date back to the 1970s and were founded on public key
infrastructure (PKI).

"PKI is not fit for a hyper connected world and that's why you're seeing
attacks against targets like the Colonial pipeline and big software
companies," Williams said.

"It's going to get worse. The computing power available to adversaries
is only going to rise over the coming years," he added.

The technology industry's next great leap will render PKI obsolete,
according to Williams. Quantum computers are expected to operate
millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers, allowing
them to break today's encryption codes with ease.

Williams said that Arqit had developed a new system based on "symmetric
encryption", in which two devices can communicate with each other using
a key consisting of a random number thousands of digits long.

To avoid the codes being intercepted by hackers master keys are
transmitted to data centres via satellite and individual codes are then
sent to devices. "Information captured in an individual particle of
light cannot be stolen and broken," Williams said.

Arqit raised $115 million through its US listing, which Williams said
was twice the amount it needed to develop its technology.

The company employs 72 people but plans to increase that number to about
2,000 over the next five years. Its service is currently delivered over
earth-bound networks, but Arqit plans to launch two satellites into
orbit in 2023.

Williams said that it had binding contracts worth $130 million with
customers including the UK government, the

European Space Agency

(ESA), BT and Sumitomo Corporation, and had a pipeline of $975 million
of future work.

Because of the looser rules around Spac flotations, Arqit has been able
to deliver some astronomical growth projections.

According to its filings at Companies House, Arqit generated no revenues
in the 12 months to the end of September last year, although it declared
£1.5 million in operating income from a contract with the ESA. It made a
pretax loss of £891,000 in the period.

Arqit has told the US market that it will report sales of $14 million
and a loss of $6 million this year. By 2025 it expects revenues to soar
to $660 million, resulting in earnings before interest, depreciation,
tax and amortisation of $477 million.

Space race is hotting up

Jeff Bezos and Sir Richard Branson hit the headlines over the summer as
they vied to become the first tourists to take a suborbital leisure
ride. But there's more to the space race than a clash of billionaires
and their towering egos.

Across the globe there are hundreds of start-ups looking to tap into the
commercial potential of outer space. Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire,
has pulled ahead of the pack with his SpaceX venture. Founded in 2002,
the company has built rockets capable of shuttling satellites and other
cargo into orbit and, crucially, has worked out how to land and reuse
the hardware after flight. It has lucrative contracts with Nasa and the
US military and was valued at a reported $74 billion when it last raised
capital in the spring.

SpaceX aims to become the workhorse of nascent space by drastically
reducing the cost of launching satellites into space.

In the 1980s, satellite operators would pay $85,000 a kilogram to get
their kit into orbit. Thanks to SpaceX they're now paying less than
$1,000 a kg, according to Mark Boggett, the managing director of
London-listed Seraphim Space Investment Trust.

Satellites, too, have become much more affordable. Nowadays they're
smaller, lighter and cheaper to build, and the investment needed to
create a constellation of satellites covering all corners of the earth
is much lower than before.

The data collected has myriad commercial uses, from enabling driverless
cars and delivery drones to predicting the weather and combating climate
change.

But the history of space start-ups is littered with failures. OneWeb,
the satellite broadband company, fell into administration in March last
year and was subsequently rescued by the UK taxpayer and the Indian
billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal.

October 22, 2019: Markelytics Solutions, a leading global market
research and analysis company launched a range of DIY Research Platforms
for companies & research agencies to help them uncover insights and
relevant market data by themselves and at their own set of parameters,
scale, and pace.

In a bid to centralize its branched offerings under different
sister-brands covering a slew of services and solutions, including
Digital Research & Service Bureau along with the newly introduced DIY
suite that subsumes four DIY Research platforms, Markelytics is gearing
to re-position itself with a new slogan, "Scale-up with our
Comprehensive & Agile Research Solutions" & convey the message of
providing all the research needs under one roof. This bundling of all
its solutions into three offering verticals, viz. Digital Research, DIY
Research Platforms and Service Bureau is aimed at bringing more
inclusiveness and value in its offerings to the clients.

Leveraging the power of technology, Markelytics has launched the DIY
suite of four research platforms to help brands and marketers find
answers to their challenges with a range of solutions including online
qualitative solutions (conducting in-depth interviews, focus groups &
other forms of qualitative research online through a live video
interaction either singularly or in groups), panel management solutions
(acquiring, engaging, managing and tracking the analytics of your
consumers), Feedback System Management (identifying their own
respondents for Panel based research along with programming the surveys
without any technical know-how), and Brands-cum-Private Communities (a
set of consumers attached to a product/service managed at one platform
for better feedback and product enhancements) at a time and to
collecting and making sense of all the data into actionable insights.

According to a study conducted by CB Insights in 2018, nearly half of
all start-up failures happen due to a lack of market need. Markelytics
believes that understanding market research and using the insights to
your advantage is vital for start-ups to be successful and stay ahead of
the curve.

Adds Jasal Shah, Managing Director & CEO, Markelytics "Technology has
changed the world as we know it from what it was a few decades ago.
Today most businesses are online, and the digitally native consumer
spends most of their time online. Market Research should also keep with
the times to connect with this breed of consumers on their turf and in
their comfort zone. Our range of new DIY Research Platforms does just
that and gives the control back to the marketer & research agencies to
help them conduct credible Market Studies at their own pace and within
their control."

Rajesh Bodke, Director, Markelytics quipped, "We expect our new range of
DIY Solutions to be of greater use to companies both traditional and new
age to assist them in their efforts to better understand the evolving
consumer. In this digital era, our DIY platforms are going to reduce the
timelines and cost incurred by companies considerably thereby removing
redundant steps from the process and shifting the power struggle in
data-driven decision making in their favor. We also want the global
startup community to become more sharp and adept in understanding the
market and consumer behavior through our DIY platforms so that the
probability of their success is increased - this is the idea behind our
dedicated startup offering."

Adds a leading Venture Capitalist, 'Startups struggle often as they fail
to understand and uncover insights from new markets other than their
familiar territory. This is why you see certain startups strong in some
markets with their competitors strong in others. The new range of
solutions from Markelytics gives these startups a range of DIY tools in
MR, and Technology is something they are comfortable with and gives them
the ability to manage and run it on their own. This could help them
immensely in scaling and discovering new markets and frontiers."

Markelytics is offering the 'Startups Growth Program' with a slew of
early bird offers to help startups adopt this new form of DIY Market
Research. Needless to say, the Markelytics backend team is available
around the clock to help companies get used to the new technology and
tools. The 'Startups Growth Program' includes:

a- Free 300 Minutes of Subscription to Online Qualitative Solutions per
Business Idea/Feasibility Study so that they can conduct online In-Depth
interviews/Focus group discussion; an additional 100 minutes could also
be given on a case-to-case basis

a- 20 Days of Free Subscription to Panel Management Solution Platform to
analyze the consumers' data & engage them better; additional 10 days
could be given on a case-to-case basis

a- 3 Months of Free Subscription to Feedback System Management Platform
with up to 200 survey completes for research study in India completely
free; additional 1 month and 100 completes could be given on a
case-to-case basis

Following are the services available presently available with the
Markelytics DIY Suite:

Online Qualitative Solutions: It is a new-age DIY interactive platform,
with multi-sector and multi-functional applicability. The platform gives
a 360-degree perspective about the respondents (person who gives the
interviews on a particular subject during the research) through
one-of-its-kind integrated features, such as Facial Coding,
Eye-tracking, Heat Mapping, Backroom Participants, etc. This platform
allows respondents to join a video call without any installation and the
moderators (or the facilitators) can easily conduct/schedule calls,
record meeting sessions, in-call polls with participants and view
instant results, etc.

Panel Management Solutions (PMS): This is majorly targeted to panel
providers, who have a large amount of panelists' data & this platform
helps in better engagement & management of this data. Moreover,
companies can also use this DIY platform to acquire new members and
improve the response rate & panel quality. Alternatively, brands can
also, use this platform to better engage and manage their consumers &
map their journey as well & digital marketers can streamline their
marketing strategy and monetize their traffic by converting the visitors
into registered members. PMS transforms the way of market research and
consumers (or clients) shake hands with the digital revolution to help
access and analyze data-driven by technology.

Feedback System Management: Features-loaded DIY platform to create
surveys without any technical know-how with multiple question types
including image/video-based & SEC based questions. The integrated panel
helps to get the survey completes in no time with real-time results.

One more solution, Brands-cum-Private Communities, is currently under
development.

One of the early adopters of Online Qualitative Solutions says, "While
our app is quite popular in the metros, we are now looking at scaling
into tier 2 towns. We found that the Online Qualitative Solutions
provided by the DIY platform efficiently and within our control to
ensure the feedback generated was relevant to us and authentic. We could
gauge a lot of insights sitting at our office, which otherwise would
have cost us a lot. We plan to explore more with this platform and
reduce the distance between our offerings and customers' expectations."

For many people, starting their own business is the ultimate
professional objective. However, there will definitely be a few
challenges that stand in the way; the most notable ones being a lack of
resources and expertise. For many people, starting their own business is
the ultimate professional objective. Nonetheless, there will definitely
be a few challenges that stand in the way; the most notable ones being a
lack of resources and expertise. According to a study by Small Business
Trends, 82% of prosperous business owners said they had the training and
expertise necessary to manage their enterprise. One of the challenges
that many young entrepreneurs confront is being taken seriously by other
experienced experts in their sector. It's common for even potential
customers to find it challenging to trust a young, unproven
businessperson with their tasks and demands. Yet, being old and having
little experience need not be an impassable obstacle.

In this article, we will have a look at few advices for young people who
are looking to be entrepreneurs from the expert Agnelorajesh Athaide,
Chairman of Global St. Angelo's Group of Companies. 

DISCOVER A MARKET OPPORTUNITY This may seem like stating the obvious,
but it's really one of the best pieces of advice that are frequently
disregarded, especially in light of the fact that the most common cause
of startup failure is an incorrect assessment of the market's need. It's
not about creating something new, but about doing something different
when determining a gap that has to be addressed. And although it's
crucial that your project be financially successful, it should also be
in line with your personal interests. When it comes to creating anything
new, it may seem as though you are stuck in the mud, but persistence and
some creative thinking can lead to a breakthrough. You may also come up
with an innovative concept by drawing on the knowledge you have gained
from your personal experiences. UNDERSTAND YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE Everyone
will never be your audience. Finding the right demographic for your
product or service is essential, since there will always be one. You may
better serve your target audience by understanding their goals, needs,
habits, and attitudes through market research. BUILD A POWERFUL NETWORK
It's critical to acknowledge the value and expertise everyone can
provide to you and your company, from your instructors to your peers.
Use all the networking opportunities available, including conferences,
seminars, internships, and coffee shop meetup. Just getting to know your
peers on a casual basis can develop into a professional working
relationship; it need not necessarily take place in a professional
context. It is a great mix to surround oneself with a group of people
that share your commitment, professionalism, and drive.

BE PREPARED TO MAKE SACRIFICES The concept of overnight success is
unreal. Even the multimillion-dollar firms that appeared to appear
overnight took numerous hours of toil before they began garnering media
attention. If you look closely, most sudden achievements take a lot of
time, as Steve Jobs once stated. It takes a lot of commitment to your
ambition to become a great entrepreneur, which necessitates both time
and financial sacrifices. It might not be easy to give up your weekend
friend hangouts or your nightly Netflix binges, but making these
sacrifices now is far simpler than waiting till you're older. LOOK FOR A
MENTOR You probably don't have all the knowledge and abilities necessary
to run a business yet. Avoid attempting to make difficult business
choices by yourself. As a result, one of the most important things a new
entrepreneur can do is locate a mentor. Mentors can guide you ahead and
help you make wiser business decisions since they have already travelled
the same route. To make these important relationships, make use of
alumni networks, conferences, and other resources. It may be
exhilarating and difficult to launch your own business. The advice in
this article will help you get off to a solid start in your
entrepreneurial adventure, even though you'll definitely face numerous
challenges and failures along the way to success. Read |

SMEs'contributiontoeconomyshouldimprove SMALLBUSINESS

The Mercury (South Africa)

Section: BUSINESS REPORT; Pg. 12

Body

THREE recently released reports paint a dismal picture of the
contribution small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are making to the
economy. They are a wake-up call for policymakers who assume that SMEs
are the main jobs drivers and will create 90percent of new jobs by 2030.

Compared to its peers, South Africa has a smaller number of firms in
proportion to the size of the economy and a much higher proportion of
jobs coming from large firms and the government. With smaller firms
closing down and shedding jobs, and larger firms getting bigger, though
not necessarily hiring more people, it is inevitable our unemployment
rate will increase further.

The reports focus on the formal SME sector and extract data from the
Treasury, Sars, commercial banks and other providers of finance as well
as firms seeking finance.

They each claim, in their respective focus areas, to be the most
comprehensive studies yet done.

They home in on changes in tax receipts over time, access to finance and
the quantum of firms and their contribution to employment to gauge
whether the sector is making its expected contribution to the economy
and participants are succeeding or struggling.

At the Small Business Initiative Indaba last week, preliminary findings
released from its research conducted in partnership with the Small
Business Project reveal that South Africa is very much the "outlier"
compared to its peers.

It found there are only 250000 formal SMEs (firms employing less than
200 people) in South Africa.

Though they comprise 98.5percent of all formal businesses, they employ
only 28percent of the formal workforce. Using Sars corporate income tax
and PAYE data, the findings indicate that SA's 1000 largest firms
account for 56percent of jobs, though this includes the government,
which skews the numbers significantly.

By contrast, in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development countries, more than 95percent of businesses are SMEs,
employ between 60 and 70percent of the working population and contribute
up to 60percent to GDP.

According to the Enterprise Observatory of SA survey of tax receipts,
released in April, "only 25percent of firms have earned sufficient to be
liable for company tax; firms with a taxable income below R10 million
decline at a rate of 31 per week; a mere 635 companies are responsible
for 77percent of company tax; and from 2009 to 2015 company losses as
submitted to Sars increased by 85percent and for the last two years were
higher than the taxable income assessed."

Reduced profitability and an alarming shrinkage in the number of SMEs
submitting tax returns are evidence that the "missing middle" of SMEs
vital to a thriving economy is in deep trouble.

The SMME Access to Funding report, released in early July, uses the
FinFind dataset, where applications for funding are matched to providers
of funding.

The 86percent of firms in the dataset turn over less than R1million a
year while 75percent were early-stage or pre-revenue. This is very much
at the bottom of the pyramid and the report notes it is here that the
demand for finance is greatest, but the supply is least.

Black business owners are seeking smaller loans to start businesses,
while white, coloured and Indian business owners seek larger loans to
grow existing businesses.

Hence, it points to a "credit gap" in South Africa of between R86bn and
R346bn.

On employment, the report estimates that firms with a turnover of less
than R100m employ in total between 2 and 3 million people, or a maximum
of 30percent of the formally employed. This echoes the SBI/SBP findings.

These three reports emphatically demonstrate an inadequate supply of new
firms feeding the economy and too few firms overall. Black-owned firms
in particular are finding it hard to get established and grow, because
of a lack of finance.

Decades, even centuries of exclusion have prevented black entrepreneurs
from building up a pool of assets which typically are required to start
a business.

Most start-ups rely on own savings and family and friends offering
patient finance, but black households do not have this luxury, so they
turn to external sources of finance.

The high failure rate of these start-ups leads to debt piles and
non-performing loans, which in turn raises interest rates to punitive
levels, creating a vicious cycle.

Fifteen years of BBBEE has done little to create a self-sustaining black
entrepreneur class. The emphasis on ownership in the scorecard has led
more to rent-seeking in existing white-owned businesses than to the
formation of new, innovative small businesses. The Department of Trade
and Industry's goal of creating 100 "black industrialists" will barely
scratch the surface and is further evidence of a band aid approach
rather than the fundamental structural reform the economy needs for new
businesses to spontaneously emerge and thrive.

Where is the Department of Small Business Development in this picture?
Sadly, nowhere. All the significant studies are private-sector initiated
and funded. The department has admitted its research capacity is limited
and it has little to offer in this debate.

Conclusions

What the department should be doing is bringing together all the
role-players and drawing conclusions to feed into policy and legislation
to remove the blockages hindering the formation and growth of small
businesses.

The SME sector performance can be summed up in three metrics: the number
of start-ups created annually, their survival rate and their growth rate
over time. Then, add people employed, turnover, corporate income tax
paid and IRP5 receipts to give us a picture of their contribution to the
economy. If these numbers go up consistently, we know we are on the
right track.

Government policies and our distorted history are compounding to drain
the lifeblood out of our small and medium enterprises. For them to claim
their rightful place in the economy a completely new approach is needed.

This starts with improving the entrepreneurial incentive so that more
new businesses are created. Reducing regulations and red tape, paying
invoices on time, levelling the playing field between big and small
businesses, a focus on competitiveness and integration rather than
compliance and protection, and collaboration between business and
government to improve the risk/return, while reducing the cost of
borrowing, are obvious next steps.

More broadly, SA's economy needs to be reconceived to have large
companies work with small companies to ferret out export opportunities
and the small companies should, wherever possible, look to piggyback on
the large companies' existing asset bases.

This requires a determined effort by the likes of Business Unity SA,
Business Leadership SA and the chief executives' initiative to place
collaboration with small business front and centre of its policy
initiatives and to take the lead along the path government has failed to
tread.

Project XL Site-Specific Rulemaking for Georgia-Pacific Corporation's
Facility in Big Island, VA; DIrect Final Rule

Impact News Service

November 14, 2020 Saturday

Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved

[]

Length: 9456 words

Body

Washington, DC: This Rule document was issued by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)

Action

Direct final rule.Summary

Under the Project XL program, the EPA is supporting a project for the
Georgia-Pacific Corporation facility located in Big Island, Virginia.
The terms of the project are defined in the “Georgia-Pacific Corporation
Big Island, Virginia Project XL Final Project Agreement” (FPA). The EPA
is issuing this rule, applicable only to the Georgia-Pacific Big Island
facility, to help implement the project.

Under the terms of the FPA, Georgia-Pacific will install and operate the
first commercial scale, black liquor gasification system in the United
States. Use of this system will provide superior air emissions
reductions and energy benefits compared to the use of conventional
technology for recovering pulping chemicals from black liquor wastes in
the pulp and paper industry. Once installed and successfully operating,
the black liquor gasification system is expected to easily meet emission
standards that apply (specifically the National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants From Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at
Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills,
promulgated in the Federal Register on January 12, 2001 (66 FR 3179)).
However, since the system will be the first demonstrated on a commercial
scale in the United States, there is some risk that it ultimately will
not operate successfully. If this event occurs, Georgia-Pacific may
require temporary relief from the otherwise applicable emissions
standards. Without this relief, Georgia-Pacific would not proceed to
commercialize the gasification technology. This action provides a
limited extension to the date of compliance with the standards for the
Big Island facility if the system is not successful.Dates

This direct final rule will be effective on June 25, 2001, without
further notice, unless EPA receives adverse comments by April 25, 2001.
Written comments must be received by April 25, 2001. Anyone requesting a
public hearing must contact the EPA no later than April 5, 2001. If a
public hearing is held, it will be on April 28, 2001, at 10:00 a.m
Requests to present oral testimony must be made by April 16, 2001.
Persons interested in requesting a hearing, attending a hearing, or
presenting oral testimony at a hearing should call Mr. David Beck at
(919) 541-5421. If we receive any adverse comment, we will publish a
timely withdrawal in the Federal Register informing the public that this
direct final rule will not take effect.Addresses

By U.S Postal Service, send comments (in duplicate if possible) to: Air
and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6102), Attention Docket
Number A-2000-42, U.S EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC
20460. In person or by courier, deliver comments (in duplicate if
possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6102),
Attention Docket Number A-2000-42, U.S EPA, 401 M Street, SW.,
Washington, DC 20460. The EPA requests that a separate copy of each
public comment be sent to the contact person listed below.

Comments also may be submitted electronically by sending electronic mail
(e-mail) to: a-and-r-docket@epa.gov Electronic comments must be
submitted as an ASCII file avoiding the use of special characters and
any form of encryption. Comments also will be accepted on diskette in
WordPerfect or ASCII file format. All comments in electronic form must
be identified by the docket number (No. A-2000-42). No confidential
business information should be submitted through e-mail. Electronic
comments may be filed online at many Federal Depository Libraries.

If a public hearing is held, it will take place at the EPA Office of
Administration Auditorium, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.For
Further Information Contact

EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, telephone number (919) 541-5421,
e-mail: beck.david@epa.gov Supplementary Information

The EPA is publishing this rule without prior proposal because we view
this as a noncontroversial rule and do not anticipate adverse comment.
However, in the “Proposed Rules” section of today's Federal Register, we
are publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposal in
the event adverse comments are filed. This rule will be effective on
June 25, 2001, without further notice unless we receive any adverse
comment by April 25, 2001. The amendment provision for extended
compliance times for Georgia-Pacific's Big Island facility, as described
in the XL project FPA, is crucial to the company's plan to commercialize
black liquor gasification. Given the economic and environmental benefits
presented by this technology, its use could eventually become widespread
in the pulp and paper industry. The draft FPA, including all details of
the project, was made available for public comment through a Federal
Register notice on May 8, 2000 (65 FR 26606). No adverse comments were
received as a result of that notice, and the FPA subsequently was signed
by the EPA, the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service,
Georgia-Pacific, and Virginia's Department of Environmental
Quality.Outline

I. Congressional Review ActI. OverviewA. Project XL

This site-specific regulation will help implement a project developed
under Project XL, an EPA initiative to allow regulated entities to
achieve better environmental results at less cost. Project XL—Excellence
and Leadership—was announced on March 16, 1995, as a central part of the
National Performance Review and the EPA's effort to reinvent
environmental protection (60 CFR 27282, May 23, 1995). Project XL
provides private and public regulated entities an opportunity to develop
a limited number of their own pilot projects, which afford them
regulatory flexibility but also produce environmental protection that is
superior to what would be achieved through compliance with current and
reasonably anticipated future regulations. These efforts are crucial to
the Agency's ability to test new regulatory strategies that reduce
regulatory burden and promote economic growth while achieving better
environmental and public health protection. The Agency intends to
evaluate the results of this and other Project XL projects to determine
which specific elements of the project(s), if any, should be more
broadly applied to other regulated entities for the benefit of both the
economy and the environment.

Under Project XL, participants in four categories—facilities, industry
sectors, governmental agencies, and communities—are offered the
flexibility to develop common sense, cost-effective strategies that will
replace or modify specific regulatory requirements on the condition that
they produce and demonstrate superior environmental performance. To
participate in Project XL, applicants must develop alternative pollution
reduction strategies pursuant to eight criteria: superior environmental
performance; cost savings and paperwork reduction; local stakeholder
involvement and support; test of an innovative strategy;
transferability; feasibility; identification of monitoring, reporting
and evaluation methods; and avoidance of shifting risk burden. They must
have the full support of affected Federal, state and tribal agencies to
be selected. For more information about the XL criteria, readers should
refer to 60 FR 27282, May 23, 1995 and 62 FR 19872, April 23, 1997, and
the September 1999 document “A Guide to Writing Final Project Agreements
under Project XL. ”

The XL program is intended to allow the EPA to experiment with untried,
potentially promising regulatory approaches, both to assess whether they
provide benefits at the specific facility affected, and whether they
should be considered for wider application. Such pilot projects allow
the EPA to proceed more quickly than otherwise would be possible when
undertaking changes on a nationwide basis. As part of this
experimentation, the EPA may try out approaches or legal interpretations
that depart from or are even inconsistent with longstanding Agency
practice, so long as those interpretations are within the broad range of
discretion enjoyed by the Agency in interpreting statutes that it
implements. The EPA may also modify rules, on a site-specific basis,
that represent one of several possible policy approaches within a more
general statutory directive, so long as the alternative being used is
permissible under the statute.

Adoption of such alternative approaches or interpretations in the
context of a given XL project does not, however, signal the EPA's
willingness to adopt that interpretation as a general matter, or even in
the context of other XL projects. It would be inconsistent with the
forward-looking nature of these pilot projects to adopt such innovative
approaches prematurely on a widespread basis without first determining
whether or not they are viable in practice and successful in the
particular projects that embody them. Furthermore, as EPA indicated in
announcing the XL program, the Agency expects to adopt only a limited
number of carefully selected projects. These pilot projects are not
intended to be a means for piecemeal revision of entire programs.
Depending on the results in these projects, EPA may or may not be
willing to consider adopting the alternative interpretation again,
either generally or for other specific facilities.

The EPA believes that adopting alternative policy approaches and
interpretations, on a limited, site-specific basis and in connection
with a carefully selected pilot project, is consistent with the
expectations of Congress about EPA's role in implementing the
environmental statutes (so long as the Agency acts within the discretion
allowed by the statute). Congress' recognition that there is a need for
experimentation and research, as well as ongoing reevaluation of
environmental programs, is reflected in a variety of statutory
provisions, such as sections 101(b) and 103 of the CAA.

Each XL project relies on the input from a project stakeholder group,
which usually includes representatives from the project sponsor, EPA,
the involved State environmental agency, environmental groups, local
community representatives, and other parties with an interest in the
project. The stakeholder group works out the provisions of the FPA,
which includes the details of the project, a timetable for completion,
and the responsibilities of the signatories. The FPA is a statement of
the plans and intentions of each signatory with respect to the project,
but is not a legally binding document. The stakeholder group for the
Georgia-Pacific project included representatives from the EPA, the
Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, the USDA Forest Service,
the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), a local environmental group, the Big
Island community, and, of course, Georgia-Pacific. A notice that the
draft FPA for the Georgia-Pacific project was available for public
comment appeared in the Federal Register on May 8, 2000. No comments
were received on the draft FPA, and the final FPA was signed on May 31,
2000 by Georgia-Pacific, the EPA, the Virginia Department of
Environmental Quality, and the USDA Forest Service (the final FPA has
been posted on EPA's website at:
http://www.epa.gov/ProjectXL/georgia/index.htm). In the agreement, EPA
committed to undertake this rulemaking.B. Georgia-Pacific Project
Description

Georgia-Pacific owns and operates a non-sulfur, non-bleaching pulp and
paper mill at Big Island, Virginia. The facility produces two products:
corrugating medium, which is used by box manufacturing plants to make
the fluted inner layer of corrugated boxes; and linerboard, which is
used for the inside and outside layers of the boxes. Corrugating medium
is made from semi-chemical (sodium carbonate/sodium hydroxide) hardwood
pulp and secondary (recycled) fiber, and linerboard is made from fiber
recycled from old corrugated containers, clippings and rejects from
corrugated container manufacturing plants, and some mixed office waste
paper. The secondary fiber operations supply 100 percent of the fiber
for the linerboard mill and about 20 percent of the fiber for the
corrugating medium mill. Overall, the mill produces an average 870 tons
per day of corrugating medium and 730 tons per day of linerboard.

The mill is located in Bedford County, adjacent to the James River and
approximately 20 miles northwest of Lynchburg, Virginia. A principal
concern for this area is air quality due to the close proximity of the
James River Face Wilderness. The James River Face Wilderness is about 3
miles to the northwest of the mill and under the CAA was classified a
Federal Class I air quality area. The USDA Forest Service, a signatory
to the FPA, is the designated Federal Land Manager for assuring that the
air quality related values for this Class I area are maintained.

The population of Big Island is approximately 400. The population within
a 5-mile radius is about 2,100. Within a 25-mile radius of the mill
(which includes the city of Lynchburg) is a population of approximately
111,500.

The mill currently handles the spent (“black”) liquor from wood pulping
operations by reducing liquor water content using a conventional
multiple effect evaporation train and combusting the concentrated (about
60 percent solids) liquor in two smelters. Molten smelt is drawn from
the smelters and dissolved in water to recover the sodium carbonate.
This solution is used to make up the cooking liquor added to the
hardwood chips going to the digesters (cooking vessels) to produce the
pulp. Exhaust gases from the smelters pass through a venturi scrubber
and are then discharged to the atmosphere.

The mill currently is subject to two emission standards. The first is
the so-called “Cluster Rule,” promulgated on April 15, 1998 (40 CFR part
63 subpart S) under the CAA. That rule sets performance standards for
regulated emission sources in pulp and paper production plants and is
based on maximum achievable control technology (MACT). A second MACT
based standard applicable to pulp and paper mills (National Emission
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Chemical Recovery Combustion
Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills
or “MACT II”), was promulgated in the Federal Register on January 12,
2001 (66 FR 3179) specifically to address hazardous air pollutant
emissions from combustion sources associated with the recovery of
pulping chemicals. Georgia-Pacific's two existing smelters (a type of
semi-chemical combustion unit) are subject to the second rule.

The MACT II rule contains a performance standard to be met, but does not
specify a particular technology that must be used. The current emissions
from Georgia-Pacific's two existing smelters at Big Island are above the
HAP emission standard in the MACT II rule. For Georgia-Pacific's Big
Island facility to meet the standard in the MACT II rule, the smelters
would have to be upgraded substantially. The age and physical condition
of the smelters dictates that they either be rebuilt with additional
emission control devices or replaced, such as with a conventional
recovery boiler commonly used in the industry. Of these two options,
Georgia-Pacific would choose to replace the smelters with conventional
recovery technology. However, Georgia-Pacific also investigated a third
alternative for chemical recovery, replacing the smelters with a
PulseEnhanced TM, steam reforming black liquor gasification system,
developed by Stone Chem, Inc. This technology uses steam reforming to
convert the organics in black liquor to a hydrogen-rich gas fuel,
leaving the residual pulping chemicals (primarily sodium carbonate) for
reuse. The gas can then be used as a clean burning energy source for
heat in the gasification unit and as an alternative boiler fuel,
replacing fossil-fuel based (non-renewable) natural gas. Implementation
of such a gasification system is expected to allow the Big Island
facility to reduce emissions well below the MACT II HAP emission
standards, and to significantly lower emissions of other criteria
pollutants, compared to installation of conventional technology.

The signatories to the FPA believe that gasification of black liquor
represents a new and better approach for the chemical recovery process
and eliminates many of the deficiencies of the conventional recovery
furnace and fluid bed combustion technologies. The benefits of
gasification to the paper industry generally are expected to include:
increased efficiency in energy conversion and chemical recovery,
elimination of the smelt-water explosion hazard, reduced operation and
maintenance costs, and significantly lower environmental emissions. The
emissions expected to be reduced include: particulates (PM, PM 10),
sulfur dioxide (SO 2), total reduced sulfur (TRS), nitrogen oxides (NO
X), volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO), hazardous
air pollutants (HAP), and greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide
(CO 2). These benefits are particularly attractive to pulp mills such as
Georgia-Pacific's at Big Island that use a semi-chemical non-sulfur
process that requires auxiliary fossil fuel to sustain combustion of the
black liquor. Projected benefits to the Big Island facility and
surrounding areas include significant reductions in NO X, VOC, CO, and
particulates. Table 1 below is taken from the FPA and compares actual
emissions from the existing smelters to estimated emissions from use of
conventional recovery boiler technology and a new gasification
system.Note

The emissions are based on combustion of 400,000 lbs per day of black
liquor solids).

Although HAP emissions are not listed separately in the table, the HAPs
emitted at the facility are organic and, therefore, included in the
value for VOC.Table 1.—Emissions Comparison of Chemical Recovery Units

Although Georgia-Pacific's feasibility analysis indicated the risks of
attempting to construct and operate the new technology would be within
acceptable limits from a technical standpoint, the company had two other
concerns. The first concern was the cost of the project. Estimated costs
to complete a gasification project, the first of its kind, were quite
high and considerably more than costs for installing a new conventional
recovery boiler. Therefore, Georgia-Pacific sought and has received some
co-funding help from the U.S Department of Energy (DOE). The second
concern involved compliance with the MACT II rule. With this
demonstration of a new technology come risks that the technology
ultimately will not be successful. If this situation occurs,
Georgia-Pacific may not have a functioning replacement for their
smelters in time to meet the MACT II compliance date, which is March 13,
2004. Therefore, the FPA for this XL project contains EPA's commitment
to undertake a rulemaking to provide temporary relief from the MACT II
compliance date for this situation (and also for a defined time period
in which Georgia-Pacific will run the new gasification system on black
liquor from a Kraft pulp mill, to fulfill an obligation under their
funding agreement with DOE). The nature of this relief and the rationale
for it are discussed more fully in section III.B of this preamble.

As indicated by the schedule in the FPA, Georgia-Pacific has begun
preliminary construction activities at Big Island for the black liquor
gasification system. The construction schedule calls for completion of
equipment installation by August 30, 2002 and completion of activities
leading to startup by September 1, 2003. Of course this schedule is
subject to some uncertainties, especially considering the technology is
being installed for the first time at this scale. Delays may occur not
only in the procurement and installation of equipment, but also in the
start-up of the system. The system is complex, and individual components
must be operated and adjusted before the entire system can be started.
Georgia-Pacific anticipates additional adjustments as operation of the
entire system is attempted and as production is gradually increased
toward capacity.

If the gasification system cannot be operated successfully,
Georgia-Pacific will construct a conventional recovery boiler. This will
take approximately three years from the time the gasification system is
declared a failure. After either successfully starting up the
gasification system and conducting the Kraft liquor trials or declaring
the gasification system a failure and constructing and starting up a
conventional recovery boiler, Georgia-Pacific will shut down and
decommission the existing smelters.II. Amendments to the MACT II RuleA.
Georgia-Pacific's Flexibility Need

There are no current full-scale commercial applications of the black
liquor, steam-reforming gasification technology of the type proposed by
Georgia-Pacific. Therefore, there is a risk that the gasification system
will fail. Although Georgia-Pacific considers this an unlikely
occurrence, it is possible that despite Georgia-Pacific's best efforts,
the system may never perform as expected or to a level sufficient to
warrant continued operation. If this happens, Georgia-Pacific will
construct a standard chemical recovery boiler in lieu of a gasification
system to comply with MACT II, and will need to continue to operate the
existing smelters while the standard recovery boiler is constructed. For
this situation also, Georgia-Pacific requested the flexibility to
operate the existing smelters past the MACT II compliance date for
existing sources.

In addition to the situation described above, Georgia-Pacific requested
the flexibility to operate the existing smelters for a short time after
the MACT II compliance date, as necessary, to allow Georgia-Pacific to
conduct limited trials of the new gasification system on black liquor
from a Kraft pulp mill. Kraft mill black liquor has characteristics
different from those of the liquor generated by Georgia-Pacific's
semi-chemical pulp mill. The Department of Energy is interested, as is
EPA, in the potential for widespread use of the gasification technology
in the pulp and paper industry. However, the vast majority of pulp mills
are of the Kraft type, and only a dozen or so mills in the U.S are of
the semi-chemical type. Therefore, the Department of Energy, in their
contract with Georgia-Pacific to fund part of the cost of the
gasification system, requested the trials to see how well the new
technology could handle Kraft black liquor.

Georgia-Pacific has not requested any other Federal regulatory
flexibility. The company intends to comply with all other CAA
requirements, including those for new source review of the gasification
system construction.B. Rule Changes

The amendments to the MACT II rule to help implement the Georgia-Pacific
XL project are discussed below.Note

As is the case with other Federal emission standards, EPA intends to
delegate authority to implement the provisions of the MACT II rule to
the States, and these amendments specifically to Virginia.1. Definitions

The startup of a new emissions unit is an important event because it
defines the point in time that the new unit must be in compliance with
an applicable hazardous air pollutant standard. The General Provisions
for part 63 (40 CFR part 63 subpart A) defines startup as follows:
“Startup means the setting in operation of an affected source for any
purpose. ” This definition would apply to the startup of the
gasification system at Big Island. Georgia-Pacific raised a concern with
this general definition, particularly with the possible connotation of
operation “for any purpose. ” Under this definition, the company felt
that the gasification system could be deemed by an enforcement agency to
have achieved “startup” before the many components operated together as
a system and within the specifications of the manufacturer. Startup of
the new gasification system at Big Island likely will occur only after a
protracted period of operating and adjusting the many parts of the
system, first individually and then all together; a period
Georgia-Pacific calls commissioning. The EPA agrees, in this instance,
that the General Provisions definition of startup could lead to some
confusion as to when startup occurs, especially considering that this
new, complex gasification technology has never been started up before on
a commercial scale. Therefore, a definition of “startup” applying only
to the gasification system at Big Island, has been added to §
63.861—Definitions. The definition makes clear that startup of the new
gasification unit will occur at the end of the commissioning period.2.
Compliance Extensions

Paragraph (c) is added to § 63.863—Compliance Dates to allow compliance
date extensions for the Georgia-Pacific Big Island plant in the event of
failure of the gasification system and also during the time of the Kraft
liquor trials. The compliance extensions are described more fully below.

In the event the gasification system is a failure, the amendments
provide Georgia-Pacific a compliance extension for the existing smelters
of up to three years from the date the gasification system is declared a
failure, but no later than March 1, 2007. The three years provides the
company time to build and start up a new conventional recovery boiler to
replace the existing smelters. March 1, 2007 is the longest possible
duration of the extension, since it is three years after the latest date
Georgia-Pacific agreed to declare that the system has failed. To obtain
this extension, Georgia-Pacific must provide a notice to the
Administrator stating that the system has failed and describing the
events leading to that declaration.

Finally, Georgia-Pacific, according to their contract with the
Department of Energy, must operate the new gasification system for up to
500 hours using black liquor from a donor Kraft pulp mill. While the
gasification system is processing Kraft liquor, the existing smelters
must operate to process the black liquor generated by the Big Island
plant. Although the Kraft trials will last up to 500 hours, the trials
may not run continuously for that period of time. Separate trials may
last only a few hours. Between trials various system components may be
adjusted in an effort to improve system performance or find optimum
performance. Therefore, the total elapsed time to accumulate up to 500
hours of Kraft liquor trials may be as high as 1500 consecutive hours.
The smelters must operate during this entire period. If the trials occur
after the MACT II compliance date, the amendments allow the existing
smelters to operate for up to 1500 hours during the Kraft trials,
without the MACT II standard applying. Prior to conducting Kraft liquor
trials, Georgia-Pacific must notify the Administrator of the 1500-hour
time period in which it intends to conduct the trials (and operate the
existing smelters).3. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements

Under § 63.866—Recordkeeping requirements, a new paragraph ((c)(7))
requires Georgia-Pacific to record the hours the existing smelters
operate during the Kraft liquor trials. This requirement will allow
enforcement of the 1500 maximum duration of a compliance waiver for the
existing smelters during Kraft liquor trials.

Paragraph (a)(2) has been added to § 63.867—Reporting requirements—to
specify notices Georgia-Pacific must send to the EPA Administrator (or
his/her authorized representative, such as a State that has been
delegated authority to implement the provisions of the rule), prior to
invoking one of the compliance extensions.

To obtain the three year extension to build a conventional recovery unit
in the event the gasification system fails, Georgia-Pacific must submit
a notice providing the date the company declared the system a failure
and the reasons why the technology was not successful. The decision to
declare the new gasification system a failure rests with Georgia-Pacific
alone, since only the company will know the technical information
pertaining to failure of the system. Although the decision is theirs,
Georgia-Pacific will declare the system a failure only after exhausting
all possibilities for success and only as a last resort. Despite funding
help from DOE, the company will be spending tens of millions of dollars
on the gasification system, and failure of the system means
Georgia-Pacific will have to spend additional tens of millions of
dollars to scrap the failed system and construct a conventional recovery
boiler. Thus, the company has considerable incentive to make the
technology work.

Also, prior to conducting any trials using Kraft black liquor,
Georgia-Pacific must submit a notice that: (1) Identifies the period in
which the trials will take place and (2) explains why the trials could
not be run prior to the compliance date applicable to the existing
smelters.C. Rationale for the Compliance Flexibility

For certain defined circumstances (see sections III.B.2 and III.B.3 of
this preamble), the rule amendments allow Georgia-Pacific to operate
their existing smelters beyond the MACT II standard's compliance date,
which is 3 years after the effective date of the standard. Of course,
EPA is aware that section 112(i)(3)(A) of the CAA states that compliance
with a MACT standard shall be no later than 3 years from the standard's
effective date. However, EPA notes that the special circumstances in
this instance warrant the flexibility.

First, as described above, without this flexibility, Georgia-Pacific
would not proceed to construct the black liquor gasification system. The
new gasification system, if successful at Georgia-Pacific's Big Island
facility, is expected to produce significant environmental benefits,
including reductions in emissions of all regulated air pollutants. These
reductions extend beyond those expected from conventional recovery
boilers, which are commonly used in the industry and can meet the MACT
II standard. (See section II.B.2 of this preamble for a discussion of
emission reduction benefits.)

These emission reduction benefits include the effects of the
gasification system's greater energy efficiency. The system will convert
black liquor into a hydrogen rich gas. Some of this gas will be used to
fuel the pulsed heaters providing energy to the gasification process and
the remaining gas will be combusted in a boiler to produce steam. Steam
generated by the gasification system will offset steam currently
generated at Big Island by fossil fuel combustion. Although a
conventional recovery boiler also will produce steam, the gasification
system at Georgia-Pacific's Big Island facility is expected to do so
with somewhat greater energy efficiency, lower air pollution levels, and
significantly lower annual operating costs.

Successful completion of this XL project will show this technology to be
capable of providing full chemical recovery capacity for a semi-chemical
mill. This includes demonstration of the reliability and operational
flexibility of the gasification system and all of the associated
equipment. Once the technology is demonstrated, the industry can apply
it at other pulp and paper facilities to obtain better energy
conversion, improved safety, and environmental performance. The Big
Island semi-chemical mill is similar in characteristics to 12 other
mills in the U.S producing virgin pulp for containers. Success of black
liquor gasification at Big Island and success of the scheduled Kraft
liquor trials will contribute significantly to its implementation in the
much larger number of Kraft mills. Success also may pave the way for
commercial scale application of gasification to the conversion of
non-wood liquors, sludges, and agricultural wastes to energy.

In addition to producing steam, gasification technology could be used to
generate onsite electricity, thereby offsetting a pulp mill's demand for
electricity purchased from the utility grid. By configuring the black
liquor gasification system to burn the product gas in a combined cycle
gas turbine system, the energy released would be harnessed to generate
clean electricity. Although Georgia-Pacific's facility at Big Island is
not large enough to make combined cycle energy production economically
viable, Kraft process pulp mills in the U.S are large enough. For a
Kraft facility employing black liquor gasification and combined cycle
energy production, the reduction in fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas
generation would be dramatic.

Compared to average utility grid emissions, generating electricity from
a gasification unit would result in lower emissions of combustion
related air pollutants. Displacing old, coal based utility boilers with
a biomass based fuel, in this instance black liquor, would significantly
lower emissions of CO 2, a pervasive greenhouse gas that can contribute
to global climate change. When this technology is successfully
demonstrated with combined cycle energy generation and assuming
utilization of currently available biomass, studies show that the energy
savings could transform the domestic Pulp and Paper Industry from being
a net importer of 6 gigawatts of electrical power to a net exporter. The
studies also indicate that successful development and deployment of
gasification technology would result in a decrease in greenhouse gas
emissions of 18 million metric tons per year.

(Source: The Forest Products Industry Gasification Combined Cycle
Initiative, American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA) Agenda 2020,
July 1998, www.agenda2020.org).

Over the next 10 to 15 years, the industry expects that a large fraction
of the existing conventional chemical recovery boilers will reach the
end of their useful life and have to be replaced. If black liquor
gasification has become a proven technology by the time replacement
decisions are made, a large-scale conversion to the new technology could
occur.

Beyond the environmental and energy benefits described above, black
liquor gasification has a safety benefit over conventional chemical
recovery technology. In the gasification process, concentrated black
liquor is pyrolyzed in a fluid bed gasifier through indirectly applied
heat, liberating a hydrogen rich gas. Sodium carbonate pellets formed
during the pyrolysis are drawn from the fluidized bed into a dissolving
tank to reconstitute “green” liquor for recycle to the pulping process.
Other gasification or conventional recovery technologies employ flame
combustion within a reactor vessel or an intermediate smelt phase. The
formation of smelt carries the potential for smelt-water explosions,
which are a major safety concern in the operation of conventional
recovery boilers. The steam reforming, black liquor gasification process
to be constructed at Big Island does not produce a smelt phase and,
thus, eliminates the potential for smelt-water explosions.

In short, EPA sees that significant environmental, economic, and safety
benefits would accrue from successful completion of this XL project, not
only at the Big Island plant but potentially nationwide. Nonetheless,
these potential benefits must be measured against any potential adverse
effects from undertaking the project. Under this project, the potential
exists for operation of the existing smelters at Big Island beyond the
time they otherwise would have been shut down. Specifically, during the
project and under certain situations, current HAP emissions from the
existing smelters may continue beyond the MACT II compliance date (March
13, 2004). As stated before, current smelter HAP emissions are above
those that would be allowed under the MACT II standard. Without this XL
project, Georgia-Pacific would replace the smelters with conventional
chemical recovery technology on or before the compliance date. The
amounts of “excess” smelter emissions that actually will occur under
this XL project depend on how well the construction and startup of the
gasification system proceeds.

It is quite possible that Georgia-Pacific will be able to construct and
successfully start up the unit according to their current schedule,
which allows for several months of commissioning activities leading to
startup. Under such a scenario, Georgia-Pacific could shut down the
smelters before the MACT II compliance date and not need any compliance
flexibility.

Even if Georgia-Pacific is able to start up the new system according to
schedule, it is probable that the Kraft liquor trials will occur, at
least in part, after the MACT II compliance date. These trials cannot be
run until Georgia-Pacific has started up the gasification system and run
it for some period under stable operation. Therefore, it is likely that
the Kraft trials will require the smelters to operate for up to 1500
hours after the compliance date.

The worst case scenario, which also is the least likely, occurs if
Georgia-Pacific is unable to successfully operate the gasification
system. If this occurs, Georgia-Pacific would have to construct a new
conventional recovery boiler, and would be allowed up to three years to
do so. Under such a scenario, the existing smelters would operate until
the new conventional unit has achieved startup, which could be as long
as March 1, 2007.

Of all the possibilities, the most probable scenario is that the new
gasification system will be started up prior to the MACT II compliance
date, but the Kraft liquor trials will occur after that date. This means
that the greatest likelihood is that the public surrounding the Big
Island facility will experience smelter emissions up to 1500 hours
longer than they would without this XL project, of course with the
prospect of much lower emissions from success of the gasification
system.

In summary, the Agency has considered the expected environmental and
energy benefits, safety improvement, reduced operation and maintenance
costs, and high potential for transfer to the rest of the pulp and paper
industry expected from a successful demonstration of the black liquor
gasification technology at Georgia-Pacific's Big Island facility. The
Agency also has weighed the possibility of allowing the existing
emissions from the smelters, which are higher than allowed by the MACT
II standard, to persist for a limited time beyond the MACT II compliance
date. Finally, the Agency has noted the solid support for the project
from all stakeholders involved in the project, including those
representing the communities near the Big Island plant. Based on all
available information, the Agency has concluded that it is in the best
interest of the environment and public health and welfare to grant the
regulatory flexibility requested by Georgia-Pacific to undertake this XL
project. In the event that the gasification technology should fail, the
Agency would regard the Georgia-Pacific mill as a different type of mill
essentially part of its own subcategory—a mill that had attempted to
operate using a method of pulping liquor recovery—gasification—different
from that used by any other source. In the event of failure of
gasification, this unique source would then be accorded the statutory 3
year compliance period to use conventional recovery boiler technology to
achieve the MACT II emission standard. In addition, as EPA indicated in
the MACT I rule, there are rare circumstances where the three year
compliance date can serve as such a disincentive to pollution control as
to no longer properly be considered MACT. See 63 Federal Register at
18527-528 (acting to avoid discouraging mills from installing advanced
water treatment technologies). EPA is similarly acting here to assure
that the compliance date not serve as a disincentive to the potentially
great benefits of gasification technology. (This same rationale serves
to justify any potential compliance extension needed to test the new
gasification unit at Big Island, Virginia on kraft mill black liquor.)

The compliance flexibility afforded by these amendments to the MACT II
rule is limited to the existing smelters at the Big Island facility, and
only for this XL demonstration project.III. Administrative
RequirementsA. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review

Because this rule affects only one facility, it is not a rule of general
applicability and therefore not subject to OMB review and Executive
Order 12866. In addition, OMB has agreed that review of site specific
rules under Project XL is not necessary.B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
(RFA), as Amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness
Act of 1996 (SBREFA), 5 U.S.C 601

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to
conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice
and comment rulemaking requirements unless the agency certifies that the
rule will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small
not-for-profit enterprises, and small governmental jurisdictions. This
final rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities because it only affects one source, the
Georgia-Pacific plant at Big Island, VA, which is not a small entity.
Therefore, I conclude that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.C. Paperwork
Reduction Act

This action applies only to one company, and therefore requires no
information collection activities subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act, and therefore no information collection request (ICR) will be
submitted to OMB for review in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction
Act, 44 U.S.C 3501 et seq.D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), Public Law
104-4, establishes requirements for Federal agencies to assess the
effects of their regulatory actions on State, local and tribal
governments and the private sector. Under section 202 of the UMRA, EPA
generally must prepare a written statement, including a cost-benefit
analysis, for proposed and final rules with “Federal mandates” that may
result in expenditures to State, local, and tribal governments, in the
aggregate, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one
year. Before promulgating an EPA rule for which a written statement is
needed, section 205 of the UMRA generally requires EPA to identify and
consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and adopt the
least costly, most cost-effective or least burdensome alternative that
achieves the objectives of the rule. The provisions of section 205 do
not apply when they are inconsistent with applicable law. Moreover,
section 205 allows EPA to adopt an alternative other than the least
costly, most cost-effective or least burdensome alternative if the
Administrator publishes with the final rule an explanation why the
alternative was not adopted. Before EPA establishes any regulatory
requirements that may significantly or uniquely affect small
governments, including tribal governments, it must have developed under
section 203 of the UMRA a small government agency plan. The plan must
provide for notifying potentially affected small governments, enabling
officials of affected small governments to have meaningful and timely
input in the development of EPA regulatory proposals with significant
Federal intergovernmental mandates, and informing, educating, and
advising small governments on compliance with the regulatory
requirements.

As noted above, this rule is limited to Georgia-Pacific's plant in Big
Island, Virginia. The EPA has determined that this rule does not contain
a Federal mandate that may result in expenditures of $100 million or
more for State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the
private sector in any one year. Thus, today's rule is not subject to the
requirements of sections 202 and 205 of the UMRA. Nevertheless, in
developing this rule, EPA worked closely with the Virginia Department of
Environmental Quality and received meaningful and timely input in the
development of this rule. The EPA also has determined that this rule
contains no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely
affect small governments.E. Executive Order 13045: Protection of
Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks

Executive Order 13045, “Protection of Children from Environmental Health
Risks and Safety Risks” (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) applies to any
rule that: (1) Is determined to be “economically significant,” as
defined under Executive Order 12866; and (2) concerns an environmental
health or safety risk that EPA has reason to believe may have a
disproportionate effect on children. If the regulatory action meets both
criteria, the Agency must evaluate the environmental health or safety
effects of the planned rule on children, and explain why the planned
regulation is preferable to other potentially effective and reasonably
feasible alternatives considered by the Agency. The EPA interprets E.O
13045 as applying only to those regulatory actions that are based on
health or safety risks, such that the analysis required under section
5-501 of the Order has the potential to influence the regulation. This
action is not subject to E.O 13045 because it is not economically
significant as defined in E.O 12866, and in fact applies only to one
source, Georgia-Pacific's facility in Big Island, Virginia.
Additionally, this action promotes lower emissions compared to the
emissions that would otherwise exist at that facility.F. Executive Order
13132 (Federalism)

Executive Order 13132, entitled “Federalism” (64 FR 43255, August 10,
1999), requires EPA to develop an accountable process to ensure
“meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the
development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications. ”
“Policies that have federalism implications” is defined in the Executive
Order to include regulations that have “substantial direct effects on
the States, on the relationship between the national government and the
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the
various levels of government. ”

This direct final rule does not have federalism implications. It will
not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as
specified in Executive Order 13132. Today's rule amends a previously
established compliance date, under certain circumstances, for one
entity, Georgia-Pacific Corporation's facility in Big Island, Virginia.
Thus, this rule does not create any mandates nor impose any enforceable
duties on the States in general or the Commonwealth of Virginia
specifically. It also will not affect the national government's
relationship with the States or the distribution of power among various
levels of government. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this
rule. Nevertheless, in developing this rule, EPA worked closely with the
Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and received meaningful and
timely input in the development of this rule.G. Executive Order 13175
(Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments)

Executive Order 13175, entitled “Consultation and Coordination with
Indian Tribal Governments” (65 FR 67249, November 6, 2000), requires EPA
to develop an accountable process to ensure “meaningful and timely input
by tribal officials in the development of regulatory policies that have
tribal implications. ” “Policies that have tribal implications” is
defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have
“substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the
relationship between the Federal government and the Indian tribes, or on
the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal
government and Indian tribes. ”

This direct final rule does not have tribal implications. It will not
have substantial direct effects on tribal governments, on the
relationship between the Federal government and Indian tribes, or on the
distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal
government and Indian tribes, as specified in Executive Order 13175.
Today's rule does not significantly or uniquely affect the communities
of Indian tribal governments. This direct final rule affects only the
Georgia-Pacific Corporation's facility in Big Island, Virginia. It does
not affect any communities of Indian tribal governments and there are no
such communities located in the vicinity of the Georgia-Pacific
facility. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this rule.H.
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA)

Section 12(d) of NTTAA, Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C 272
note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory
activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or
otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical
standards (e.g , materials specifications, test methods, sampling
procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by
voluntary consensus standards bodies. The NTTAA directs EPA to provide
Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use
available and applicable voluntary standards.

This rulemaking does not involve technical standards. Therefore, EPA is
not considering the use of any voluntary consensus standards.I.
Congressional Review Act

The Congressional Review Act, 5. U.S.C 801 et seq., as added by the
Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally
provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the
rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to
each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United
States. Section 804 exempts from section 801 the following types of
rules (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to
agency management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization,
procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or
obligations of non-agency parties. 5 U.S.C 804(3). EPA is not required
to submit a rule report regarding today's action under section 801
because this is a rule of particular applicability.List of Subjects in

Body

March 22 -- As spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft recently published a
support document that answers "Why were recently installed updates
removed?" The company writes that these updates and patches "keep your
device secure and running at peak efficiency," but they occasionally run
into incompatibility issues.

If a PC fails to start following a Windows 10 update and reboot, users
may see a notification that reads: "We removed some recently installed
updates to recover your device from a startup failure." Microsoft says
this only happens when all other automatic recovery attempts have been
unsuccessful.

Once an update has been removed, Windows 10 will prevent it from
installing automatically for the next 30 days, giving Microsoft and its
partners time to investigate and hopefully fix any issues.

Users can manually reinstall any updates that were uninstalled, but they
will be removed again if Windows 10 still doesn't start.

Microsoft said that all editions of Windows 10 will receive the feature.

Last week, it was discovered that Microsoft's latest cumulative update
had caused performance issues with games and mice. Sadly, it seems
Windows 10 won't be automatically uninstalling updates in these cases,
that only happens when a system fails to start.

Despite its problems over the years, Windows 10 passed 800 million
installs recently and is expected to reach the long-awaited one billion
milestone later this year.

What happens to Indian startups after SVB's fall?

MINT

March 12, 2023 Sunday

Copyright 2023 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 524 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, March 12 -- The shutdown and takeover of Silicon Valley Bank
(SVB) by US regulators has raised questions on how it impacts India's
startup industry. It was an important partner for the global startup
economy. Mint explains:

What happened to Silicon Valley Bank?

On 8 March, SVB surprised investors with an announcement that it was
raising $2.5 billion through a share sale, after selling $21 billion
worth of securities. On 10 March, the US Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) announced that the bank was closed by the California
Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. "To protect insured
depositors, the FDIC created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of
Santa Clara (DINB). At the time of closure, the FDIC as receiver
immediately transferred to the DINB all insured deposits of Silicon
Valley Bank," it said.

What led to the bank's downfall?

While the bank's downfall officially started last week, the failure
actually relates to the overall financial crisis plaguing the world.
Many startups were forced to withdraw funds parked at the bank after
funding dried up. The market for initial public offerings (IPOs) also
slowed due to rising interest rates, which in turn can be traced back to
the US Fed raising interest rates. The bank had to sell the $21 billion
in securities, booking a loss of $1.8 billion. Its stock sale also
collapsed however, and more clients withdrew funds leading the bank to
seek alternative funding by a sale of the company.

How are Indian startups viewing SVB's failure?

SVB is the largest retail banking failure since the 2008 financial
crisis. As the initial hysteria ebbed, investors and startups say that
although the bank's downfall will affect Indian startups, the industry
is far from a panic mode right now. SVB was an important partner for the
startup economy, not just in the US but worldwide as well.

How will it impact Indian startups?

For startups, especially those raising funds from US investors, SVB was
a medium for venture debt and for depositing their own funds. Investors
and analysts said that for companies that deposited funds, the downfall
could lead to cash flow problems, which in turn may lead to trouble in
meeting payrolls and other day-to-day expenses. However, the larger
concern is that many VCs deposited millions in SVB, which could lead
them to further slow down funding moves and delay term sheets.

Which Indian startups did business with SVB?

According to data from research firm Tracxn, SVB has invested in about
21 Indian startups, including the likes of Shaadi, Naaptol and One97
Communications (which runs PayTM). In a LinkedIn post, entrepreneur
Ganesh Krishnan explained that SVB sold its shares in these firms during
further funding rounds or when the firms monetized, leaving them free of
the so-called 'ripple effect'. Investors said the real risk is for firms
which had deposits in the bank, which include software startups with
operations in the US.

Strategy: Start-Ups: The Mantras For High-Tech Startups' Success

Electronics For You

April 1, 2023

Copyright 2023 EFY Enterprises Pvt Ltd., distributed by Contify.com All
Rights Reserved

Length: 2161 words

Byline: Yashasvini Razdan

Body

Dauntless! That is what defines the Indian high-tech startup ecosystem,
which continued to grow through a pandemic and propelled the electronics
industry to aspire for a new goal-a $300 billion industry by FY26.
Realising this ambitious goal is no mean feat as the very drivers of
this goal continue to struggle to emerge out of the struggling startup
stage and become an established business. Yashasvini Razdan from
Electronics For You writes on how high-tech startups can steer through
the challenges that come their way

Eight years ago, on August 15, 2015, the Prime Minister of India
announced a new initiative called the Startup India Campaign to catalyse
startup culture and build a strong and inclusive ecosystem for
innovation and entrepreneurship in India.

In the past eight years, India has grown to become the third largest
ecosystem for startups after the US and China. In December 2022, the
Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) declared
that the number of startups in India has grown from 452 in 2016 to
84,012 in 2022 of which 23,773 came into being in 2022 itself.

Despite the glorious numbers, 90% of the startups fail, of which 10%
fail in the first year and 70% fail between the second and third years.
Many would attribute this to a lack of funding, unclear vision, and
inadequate resources. Whitewashing the failure of startups using these
three reasons isn't going to help. To reduce the percentage of failure
one needs to dive deeper into the reasons why startups fail, especially
in the hightech sector.

Traversing through 'the road not taken'

Bengaluru is the hub for startups and traffic, of course! Right from
choosing the correct transportation to factoring in the time taken to
book a ride, pre-planning one's journey before heading out is a must.
Building a startup is akin to planning a journey via 'the road not
taken' and entrepreneurs need to follow the same step while finalising
their destination.

The first rule to planning the startup journey is very obvious- a
business plan! Far too many startup founders think a pitch deck is a
business plan, which is a very wrong notion. A business plan is a live
document, which is constantly revised and not something with a pretty
ring binder only to be forgotten about later.

Trudging alone, on the road not taken, is a daunting task but a partner
can surely make the journey easier. For startup entrepreneurs, choosing
the right co-founder is like selecting the right life partner.
Cofounders with complementary skills and those who mutually agree on the
business plan can make it easier to navigate through the whirlwind of
challenges encountered by a startup.

The co-founders need to be clear on the goals they aim to serve. Do they
wish to be a product startup or a services startup, or do they want to
sail on both the boats? Product development just for the sake of
innovation does not warrant the sustenance and growth of a startup.

To be successful, startups need to converse, interact, and talk to at
least 50-100 customers in a particular segment to identify their needs
and build a product that serves those needs and eventually sells. Asking
the right questions that get a customer to open up about their
requirements, allows entrepreneurs to formulate and obtain more clarity
on how their product should get developed. These customers can later be
approached again, once the prototype is ready, to check whether it meets
their needs.

By this time, the ringing question that would come to an entrepreneur
would be, 'How does one collate all that information to understand and
utilise it?' Big manufacturers go to market research firms but startups
lack the capital to afford that kind of luxury. So, they can make use of
open source tools, such as a Google Dashboard, which is free. Crunching
numbers, simulating data, creating a demo-it offers all.

While these shortcuts do help attract investors and generate the
interest of potential customers, startups should remember that these are
tools to aid them and not crutches to depend upon. Products developed by
startups are designed to ease the life of customers, but the startups
cannot take a shortcut to achieve their goal. So, relying on sources
such as GitHub without understanding the specific application context
can prove to be disastrous in the later stages of product development.

While finalising the destination and route, entrepreneurs need to gauge
the time it would take for their startup to achieve its goals. Factoring
lead times and the cost of raw materials is an indispensable part of
this planning stage. Covid-19 and the semiconductor supply crunch have
shown us that entrepreneurs need to be prepared for all supply-chain
issues they may face.

Tackling the bull

Product development is a long-drawn process. After crossing multiple
barriers, when a startup finally reaches the product development stage,
life doesn't become any easier than it had been earlier. Decisions
regarding finances and product design can make or break the life of the
startup.

Manoeuvring through this battlefield of challenges cannot be done
without the guidance of an experienced professional. Having a mentor or
a trusted network of individuals to talk to and discuss specific needs
can be of great assistance.

If the startup connects with a startup incubator, guidance pertaining to
development and business strategy will be readily provided to them.
Various Centres of Excellences (CoEs) under the Software Technology
Parks of India (STPI) have been set up in different cities of India to
assist hardware manufacturers working on disruptive technologies in the
electronics industry.

Every startup needs funds and support to come up with a prototype for
its customers. Connecting with the correct investors and incubators is
similar to finding an escalator to reach the next level of growth.

When looking for investment through private equity investors, startup
founders should choose the correct investors who understand the perils
of developing a hardware technology product startup. Seeking funding
from 'real estate investors' who want 100% returns within a year is the
same as drinking soup using a fork! The chef (investor) will keep on
wondering why the soup (product) isn't finished.

The government has announced multiple grants, such as the NIDHI
(National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations) Prayas,
aimed at providing prototype funding to convert an idea into a prototype
of a product that has the potential for commercialization for aspiring
innovators.

Consortium of Electronics Industries of Karnataka (CLIK) President,
Madhav R. Badsheshi, told EFY, "Schemes such as Nidhi Prayas provide a
grant of Rs 10 lakh (one million rupees) to startup companies or
entrepreneurs. In the beginning, for making the initial prototype, this
amount suffices but as you go up the ladder, you'll need more funds.
You'll need a lot of money for a market survey alone! You'd need to
study the market, and after getting the inputs, you'll have to adjust
your business plan."

To reap maximum benefits from investors, entrepreneurs need to have a
clear understanding and focus on what product they are going to build.
Most of the work is already done if the innovator has a fine business
plan. Along with that, the entrepreneur needs to highlight the
innovation and explain what other options are already available in the
market.

Investors need to know the reason they should invest in a particular
startup. With a detailed but very articulate business plan, startup
founders can convince the investors to invest in their startup even
before they come up with a minimum viable product (MVP).

Moving on from the ideation to an actual proof-of-concept (PoC) phase is
the next challenge in the life of a startup. To come up with an MVP, the
startup needs to go back to those customers they spoke to during the
ideation phase.

"You need to have a set of specific questions for your customers and
constantly refine your idea to make it useful. Don't try to boil the
ocean at this stage and add up all of the features into one product.
That will take another year," cautions Bharat Innovation Fund partner
Somshubhro Pal Choudhury.

Choudhury's warning is further supported by Maker Village CEO,
Nizamuddin Mohammed, who articulates the need for rapid prototyping. He
says, "With every hardware product, you need rapid prototyping. We call
it the fail-fast technique. You need to come up with a product fast,
test it out with the customer in your target segment, and then iterate
on it."

Once customer interest is generated and the MVP is ready, startups need
to start minting money. The sustainability of a startup depends entirely
on how much money it has in its coffers and how it gets the cash
flowing. Taking eyes off the cash flow at any time means a sure death
for the startup.

Choudhury explains how startup founders can do pricing discovery at this
stage. He advises startups to engage in a repeatable kind of business
that ensures recurring revenue, which would get the investors excited.
"When you do a pilot PoC with the customer, do not go for a free PoC. At
least get some money out of the customer. This way their willingness to
pay gets tested," he says.

Choudhury also underlines the importance of the founders doing the first
few sales, instead of sending in a sales representative, to get the
actual feedback from the customers.

Trudging through the last mile

A few years ago, a telecom infrastructure company in Chennai deployed
the equipment to be used in a beautiful cast iron casing. While the cast
was designed to perfection, the company made one mistake. They forgot to
put powder coating on the cast iron casing. Within a year of deployment,
the telecom provider asked them to change the equipment as it had rusted
and didn't work anymore.

Renowned electronics industry advisor PVG Menon, who chaired the panel
discussion at the IEW 2022, narrated the above story. It was to explain
to the audience how the company had gone ahead with product development
without understanding their deployment scenarios and support
requirements.

More than often, companies develop their product in an industrial
environment and forget to account for additional support requirements in
a remote deployment scenario. Too many aspiring hardware startups
struggle to distribute their talent and skill uniformly across all
sectors of the business. Many times, the most efficient task force is
deployed towards product development while the sales and marketing
segments share the same fate as the middleborn in a conventional desi
family- ignored and left to their own devices.

Electric vehicle startup Greendzine Technologies' cofounder, Karthikeyan
Sundaram, talks about his own experience and issues a cautionary warning
for all entrepreneurs. "We assumed that since our engineering design and
product are good, we could relax on the marketing front, but that was
not correct. We had to learn marketing and sales, which was the biggest
learning struggle we had to go through for a long time. If I had to
establish a startup again, then I would focus more on marketing, sales,
branding, as well as engineering, and not the other way around," he told
EFY.

Internet of Things startup Refillbot's director, Prabhu Stavarmath,
elaborates on brand-building and scaling up on marketing. "Brand
building is very important once you have a product, so that your
prospective customers can discover you, through Google, LinkedIn, or
even the newspaper. For some, it happens organically as well, but it's
always good to have some basic marketing in place and a brand built in
the early stage. From thereon, you just need to scale up," he opines.

Adding to that, co-founder and director of the startup Silizium
Circuits, Rijin John, shares with EFY his experience with customer
interaction and the role it plays in helping the startup design its
intellectual property (IP). "Our IP roadmap was purely based on our
potential customers with whom we had already spoken and who were
interested in our product. We wanted our product to be at par or better
than the imports of IPs. We successfully taped out our first
semiconductor IP in September 2022."

The year is 2023. Gone are the days when the term startup would just
imply a new application software. India is witnessing a sweeping growth
of startups in the high-technology sector. Despite the plethora of
opportunities available, innovators in this arena are facing a lot of
challenges ranging from finance to human resources and from launch to
sustaining growth with tenacity.

It is important to ensure and aid the success of these high-tech
startups as they hold the potential of creating jobs in the
manufacturing sector and realising India's dream of achieving a $300
billion electronics industry. With appropriate support, synchronization,
and mentoring from stakeholders, the government, and the electronics
industry, startup innovators can easily manoeuvre their way to success.

WARRINGTON, Pennsylvania, April 2 -- Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. issued
the following news release:

Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB: WINT), a biotechnology and medical
device company focused on developing drug product candidates and medical
device technologies to address acute cardiovascular and pulmonary
diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter ended
December 31, 2019 and provided key business updates.

Key Business and Financial Updates

* In December 2019, the Company completed a $26.4 million private
placement of common stock and warrants. After offering expenses and the
cancellation of $2.95 million of existing indebtedness in exchange for
the securities offered, the Company received net proceeds of
approximately $23.0 million.

* The Company recently announced that it is developing plans to study
its KL4 surfactant for treatment of lung injury resulting from severe
COVID-19 infection, if it is able to secure the required additional
capital resources necessary to initiate and complete the study. The
Company is actively pursuing multiple non-dilutive funding
opportunities, including from government agencies and private
foundations.

* In March 2020, the Company entered into a binding term sheet with
Lee's Pharmaceutical Holdings (HK) Ltd ("Lee's") pursuant to which Lee's
will provide up to $3.9 million of non-dilutive project funding for the
six month period beginning April 1, 2020 for the continued development
of the Company's lead acute pulmonary product candidate, AEROSURF for
the treatment of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome
("RDS"). The financing will fund the AEROSURF phase 2b bridge study,
which if successful, is intended to transition the product into a phase
3 ready clinical program. The Company and Lee's will negotiate, in good
faith, the terms of a definitive agreement that will set forth
additional semi-annual non-refundable payments to fund the continued
development of AEROSURF subsequent to September 30, 2020. The
arrangement is intended to fund the AEROSURF bridge study, as well as
support the Company's focus of cash resources on opportunities in our
istaroxime cardiovascular clinical programs.

* In March 2020, the AEROSURF bridge study clinical sites in Poland were
initiated. Notwithstanding certain delays to ensure appropriate staffing
and evolving COVID-19 hospital procedures are put into place, these
study sites are still active, and the Company anticipates first patient
dosed early in the second quarter.

* As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$22.6 million and current liabilities of $7.8 million.

* In March 2020, the Company amended its bank credit facility agreement
($4.6 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019) to extend the
maturity date from March 2020 to March 2022.

"We made tremendous progress in 2019, capped by a $26 million private
placement closed during the fourth quarter. Our strengthened balance
sheet allows us to focus on our multiple clinical development programs
as we move forward with istaroxime for early cardiogenic shock and acute
heart failure study start-up activities, and with AEROSURF for
respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. Additionally, we
have applied for a listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and are working
to secure this objective," commented Craig Fraser, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Windtree. "While we are certain of our ability to
execute upon our strategic plan, we are faced with uncertainty as our
nation and global communities combat the global pandemic and impacts of
COVID-19. We are committed to help mitigate the devastating impact of
this virus and announced recently our intent to pursue a clinical study
treating patients with COVID-19 lung injury with our KL4 surfactant
therapy upon securing the non-dilutive capital resources to fully fund
the study. Along with clinical development, we are highly engaged in
business development activities. The December 2018 acquisition of
additional late stage products focused on areas with high unmet need
along with successful financings to execute against these opportunities,
have positioned Windtree for sustained growth and success. We are
optimistic about the prospects for the Company and look forward to
keeping our stakeholders updated in the coming months."

Select Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter ended December 31, 2019

For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported an
operating loss of $4.6 million, compared to $4.9 million for the fourth
quarter of 2018.

Research and development expenses were $2.1 million for the fourth
quarter of 2019, compared to $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of
2018. The decrease in research and development expenses is primarily due
to a decrease in employee incentive compensation expense.

General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were
$2.4 million, compared to $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2018.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to
decreases in employee incentive compensation expense and professional
fees, partially offset by an increase in non-cash stock compensation
expense.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a $1.8 million net
loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the conversion of $2.95
million of existing loans payable obligations as part of the December
2019 private placement financing. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the
Company recorded a $3.3 million net loss on debt extinguishment as a
result of the conversion of $6.0 million of existing loans payable
obligations as part of a December 2018 private placement financing.

The Company reported a net loss of $7.4 million ($0.21 per basic share)
on 34.6 million weighted-average common shares outstanding for the
quarter ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of $23.6 million
($3.24 per basic share) on 7.2 million weighted average common shares
outstanding for the comparable period in 2018. The 2018 net loss
includes a $12.5 million charge related to issuance of the AEROSURF
warrant dividend and a $1.7 million charge for a non-cash deemed
dividend on preferred stock.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company reported cash and cash equivalents
of $22.6 million, current liabilities of $7.8 million and loans
payable - non-current of $4.6 million. The loans payable - non-current
is payable in March 2022.

Readers are referred to, and encouraged to read in its entirety, the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2019 which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
April 3, 2020, which includes detailed discussions about the Company's
business plans and operations, financial condition and results of
operations.

Token of Risk

Highlight: Initial Coin Offerings are all the rage, but while a few
soar, many others crash and burn.

Body

The rewards can be huge, but so are the risks. When blockchain platform
NEO launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in end-2017, it had each
'coin' or 'token' priced at $0.03. Those tokens are now trading around
$73.25, which amounts to a gain of 2,46,067 per cent in a few months.
Yet Cryptonetix, a digital currency which held its ICO around the same
time, has since seen a 95 per cent loss of value. The problem is that
while ICOs are much the same as Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), in that
they are both intended to raise funds for a company or project, the
former are not held under the aegis of a stock exchange and do not come
with any of the due diligence certificates, company resolutions and red
herring prospectus that exchanges make mandatory for the latter. All
they usually provide is a whitepaper setting out their objectives and
the comfort that they use of blockchain technology, the indelible
digital ledger that guarantees security and transparency (See Win Some,
Lose Some).

The mode of payment is also laid down - it could be regular currency, or
Bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies. This means that the
principle of caveat emptor - or the risk being entirely the buyer's -
applies with a vengeance in ICOs, more than with any other asset class.

And yet, the popularity of ICOs only keeps rising. In 2017, which can be
considered a breakout year for ICOs, 210 ICOs were launched worldwide
raising $3.88 billion. Since then, 2018 has been even better - the first
four months saw 171 ICOs raise $5.94 globally. "ICOs will break previous
records in fund raising," says Anuj Khanna, CEO of UK-based management
consulting firm, Peak State Consulting. Many have welcomed ICOs as a
means of attracting funds from sources that were not investing in such
projects before. "The amount raised through ICOs is great for business
growth and the economy," says David Sapper, Chief Operating Officer,
Blockbid, Australia's first fully regulated cryptocurrency exchange.
"Capital that would be unthinkable for start-ups is now readily
available through ICOs."

As this new asset gains traction, it is attracting established names
too. Initial ICO investors were tech geeks out to change the world. But
now, it has caught the eyes of the guys in black suits too. "Last year,
mostly unknown start-ups went for ICOs," says Khanna. "This year we'll
see innovation and better known companies approaching the ICO market."

Standout Successes

NEO -known as AntShares when it began in 2014 - is the first open source
blockchain currency from China. It is backed by Microsoft and the
Chinese e-tailing giant Alibaba, but its success is surprising given the
Chinese government's apparent dislike for cryptocurrencies. NEO uses
smart contract applications, but with the addition of decentralised
commerce, digitised assets and identification. Another blockbuster was
Ethereum, with its cryptocurrency Ether. In 2015, Ether was sold for
$0.31 per token, but now trades at $713, second in value only to
Bitcoin. There is also Spectrecoin, which promises complete privacy,
much to the worry of governments clamping down on illegal fund
transfers. A Spectrecoin token, which cost $0.001 when it began in
November 2016, is now worth $0.64. Stratis, Ark, Lisk and Storj are some
other ICOs that have brought early investors a fortune.

While the risk of investing in an ICO is clear, there are some
advantages too. Liquidity is higher, since the coins can be traded any
time, unlike traditional venture capital investments. Again, most
investors in ICOs are strategic, not merely financial - they have an
interest in the product or service for which the funds are being raised.
Many start-ups too are eschewing traditional venture capital for ICOs.

Spotting Winners

There is no sure way of spotting winner ICOs. The whitepapers do provide
details of their projects, and while these are often in a technical
language, it is imperative to understand and evaluate them. "The main
takeaway is the feasibility of the project," says Alexey Burdyko, CEO,
Play2Live, the first decentralised streaming platform that uses
blockchain technology. "Is it solving a problem now, and will it be
solving a problem a few years down the line as well?" Investors must
consider if the product is required and has a potential market.

Almost as important is the competence of the team. "The experience and
expertise of the development team are primary risk factors," says Akash
Kawale, analyst at cryptocurrency consultancy Hacked.com. Investors
should ensure the whitepaper clearly sets out who the team members are
and their domain experience. Investors should also conduct their own due
diligence, asking questions about whether work on building the project
has begun or not and what has been accomplished, whether a prototype is
available for demonstration, whether future milestones have been set,
before putting in their money. They should find out what experts are
saying about the project on general forums such as Reddit, Slack,
Telegram, and Medium, and specialised ones like Bitcointalk. "Any
worthwhile ICO will be transparent about its progress," says Burdyko.

Like a number of other countries, India too has been suspicious of the
entire cryptocurrency environment - the Reserve Bank of India has banned
all the entities that fall under its purview from transacting in
cryptocurrency. But people investing abroad can use the $2.5 lakh annual
limit to invest. Before investing, it is thus important to find out in
which jurisdiction the product or service for which the ICO seeks funds
will operate, whether it is legal there and has complied with all
regulations. Finally, it is well known that the failure rate of
start-ups, no matter which sector they are in is high - and the same
holds true for ICOs as well. "It is important to remember that even in
the traditional technology space, 90 per cent of start-ups fail," says
Kawale. "People should only invest in ICOs the money they are prepared
to lose." <object>

'Startups Need To Consider Businesses With Strong Entry Barriers': Lead
Angels Network Director

Director Dhruv Nath said startup founders need to identify businesses
that have a strong entry barrier which prevents other companies from
copying a business model and taking away their business

Lead Angels Network Director Dhruv Nath on Saturday said startups need
to consider businesses that have high entry barriers.

Speaking at the IBLF 2022, Nath emphasised that one of the things that
startups make a mistake with is trying to compete with giants. He said
startup founders need to identify businesses that have a strong entry
barrier which prevents other companies from copying a business model and
taking away their business.

The angel investor also warned against founders trying to implement use
cases from a foreign land in India without taking into account cultural
differences. Recounting an experience with a startup looking to bring
the concept of a 'wedding gift registry' to India and its failure to
find traction, Nath said cultural barriers play a significant role
across international boundaries for startups and businesses.

"Cultural barriers have been there for thousands of years and they will
continue to exist. Don't think that a huge amount of marketing spend
will take care of the problem," he said.

Elaborating on the parameters angel investors look at while considering
investing in a startup, Nath said it's important for founders to realise
that they need to be on the same page as investors. He said that angel
investors look at potentially successful, fast-growing companies, which
can define a path to profitability and have businesses with entry
barriers to keep competition at bay.

Nath also spoke briefly on the need of learning from startup failures
despite the huge attention the success stories receive in the
entrepreneurship ecosystem and media.

Entrepreneurs Today Are Learned And Market Research Is Becoming A Part
Of Their Plan Increasingly: Amitayu Basu, NumrResearch

Business World

Amitayu Basu, CEO of RebusCode, a market research solutions company
based out of Gurgaon, is a happy man. After working in US he took the
risk of coming back to India and open his startup 8 years ago. Rebuscode
was formed as a technology company creating the backbone platform for
major research companies in India. 8 years later when Rebus established
itself in the market and is now a profitable venture, the hunger to
start again struck Amitayu. Rebus now created a separate division named
Numr Research and is entering the consumer research market.

The startup boom in India has subsided. Do you think the craze is over?

Well saying it was a craze is not really being true to the explosion of
innovation that this country has produced over the last few years. Yes,
the total number of deals have subsided year on year, but in the total
amount invested but VCs in 2018 was more than double of 2017. However in
2018, most of the deals were for late stage investments, and hence large
ticket sizes. In 2019 first half, we are again seeing similar number of
deals (as 2018) but with significantly smaller ticket sizes. . This may
look like a slowdown. But it is not.

But so many startups are failing these days

There have been both success and failure. Research says, most startups
fail within first five years of launching business. Hence, we are seeing
the first wave of failures now. This is a common phenomenon.

And, you have survived for over 8 years

Yes. And we are thankful to a lot many people including Debra Pruent
(CEO GfK), Debi Basu (MD GfK) and Ravi Jonavithula (COO Nielsen SEA) (to
name a few) for that. We believed in growing slow but steady,
bootstrapped the business ourselves and focusing on getting the basics
right. When we started the market was used to a very traditional pen and
paper way of doing things. We have worked on changing the market and run
a profitable business while launching new verticals to further expand
the market.

As a startup that succeeded and is now helping other startups succeed,
what are your biggest learning?

Last year a research by CB Insights gave a peek into why startups are
failing. 42% of the failures were attributed to lack of any market need.
There were 18% startups that failed because pricing was not correct. We
believe, reasons as such could have been easily avoided.

Five friends got together, everybody supported each other's idea, their
parents thought great about the idea and then they launched. This is a
wrong process. How do you know if people you will be selling to actually
wants to buy your service? How do you know people are ready to pay as
much as you expect them to pay? One or two prospective customers
boosting you up at the ideation stage doesn't suffice. Even those people
will behave differently when it comes to actually paying for the
service.

Any innovation needs structured feedback. You need a proper market
research even before you get down to creating your product. A methodical
study on the prospective customer's opinion about your idea, offerings
or pricing can be give life saving insights to a new startup. This small
investment to do market sizing and pricing pays many times over and
should be one of the first things that a VC or start-up does to evaluate
the idea.

When we started, we knew exactly who wants to buy (and who doesn't) and
we also knew at what price they want to buy. So, nothing for us was on
the basis of gut feeling. Everything was scientifically approached.

But then, isn't market research a costly proposition for startups?

Not exactly. Compared to how much you are putting at stake when you
launch the business, this is a fractional cost. In fact, a basic market
research or pricing research will cost a startup only around INR 1.5 L.

Why a market research company is important? Can't this be a
do-it-yourself (DIY) thing? There are so many platforms like
surveymonkey where you can create surveys

Yes. You can create surveys on your own. You can also select your set of
respondents and collect data. But the challenge comes in generating
insights from the data. It is not a set of graphs alone that you do as a
project for your college subject. This needs to be approached much more
scientifically.

For example, 'how much are you willing to pay for a soap' is never
without a context. The answer will change basis a number of factors like
the brand, size, packaging (box/sachet), medium (liquid/bar) etc. An
experienced survey company will know how to frame questions right, how
to validate a question with other follow up question, how to analyse the
answers and generate the most meaningful insight for you. The best
company will be able to get this all done within hours or posing the
research question with industry level learning baked in the insights
using advanced machine learning.

As a company offering market research services to startups, do you find
enough takers of the service?

Yes, We do. Entrepreneurs today are learned. They know the grind and
market research is becoming a part of their plan increasingly. So while
we are already working with major unicorns, we are constantly seeing a
rise of interest in market research from the 'about to be launched' OR
'newly launched' startups.

What are the way forward for Numr Research?

Our company Rebuscode has gained enough attraction as a research based
technology company that specialized in analyzing survey inputs. We have
been supporting big research companies like IPSOS, Nielsen, Kantar etc.
with our platform.

Now, we are getting into consumer research ourselves through Numr
Research. We are bringing in the best of technology and layering it up
with our learning to create an affordable yet world class service for
all companies. And we have just started our journey.

India home to nearly 40% of world's heart failure patients

#Beat Heart Failure

India is home to 40% of the world's 2.6 crore patients with heart
failure, yet there is poor awareness about the condition and its
treatment.

Maharashtra public health minister Eknath Shinde delivered this pithy
message while kickstarting the Times of India's initiative on heart
failure last week. Called the Beat Heart Failure, the initiative is
partnered by pharma major Novartis and aims to educate the masses about
heart failure and encourage them to undertake a basic symptom check.

The meeting—first in a series of discussions to be held in various
cities—was attended by select bureaucrats and academicians in Mumbai who
discussed ways to tackle this relatively new epidemic in India. Setting
up heart failure registry and starting heart failure clinics in medical
schools and private hospitals emerged as main solutions.

Dubbing the Beat Heart Failure campaign as an “essential” and “noble''
cause, Shinde said, “Heart failure is a challenge ahead of us as, more
so because Indians are prone to lifestyle diseases, like hypertension
and diabetes, that are risk factors for heart failure.”

He quoted a 2017 study that showed that only about 50% of India's heart
failure patients take medicines. “We need to work out a way ahead to
ensure that more patients are diagnosed early and started on treatment,”
he added.

KEM Hospital's cardiology department head Dr Prafulla Kerkar said the
problem of heart failure seems worse here because the condition
manifests a decade earlier among Indians. A problem vis-à-vis heart
failure is that no one is directly diagnosed as a heart failure patient
because it usually develops as a result of some other chronic condition.
“If a patient has diabetes or cardiovascular disease and has a low
ejection fraction (heart's pumping capacity), the patient has a high
risk of heart failure and should

undergo further diagnostic tests,” he added.

Dr Suresh Menon of Novartis said heart failure had a peculiar pattern.
“Most diseases start with an acute attack before the condition becomes
chronic, but it is the opposite with heart failure,” he said. Patients
first show up with chronic heart failure which becomes acute and needs
hospitalization, he added.

After understanding the details of India's heart failure epidemic that
the experts recommended setting up of a heart failure registry in
Maharashtra. At present, only Kerala has a heart failure registry funded
by the Indian Council for Medical Research.

Dr Amol Wankhede, a World Health Organisation advisor with the
Maharashtra government, felt heart failure could emerge as an epidemic
if measures aren't taken soon. “If not diagnosed early, patients will
require repeated ICU admissions,” he said, adding that the need of the
hour is setting up guidelines that even primary health centres could
follow. The idea is early identification so that patients can be rushed
for further treatment

to tertiary-care hospitals in urban areas.

Dr Sadhana Tayade, from the state director general of health services,
identified the lack of trained manpower as one of the impediments in
early diagnosis. “There is a scarcity of heart experts at the district
levels. There is only one MD-trained physicians for heart for 14
district hospitals,” she said. However, she added that government's
screening for non-communicable disease could help identify patients. “We
are also empanelling private hospitals and cardiologists in the private
sector to help,” she said.

State medical education secretary Dr Sanjay Mukherjee said Maharashtra
has undertaken many initiatives to improve heart care. “We are
increasing the number of seats for super specialists this year onwards
so that we have better infrastructure for heart care,” he said. The
Maharashtra government has tied up with NGO Golden Hour Foundation to
train interns on the importance of golden hour in heart treatment.

Dr Mukherjee added that studies should be conducted to check if
artificial intelligence could help in identifying the vulnerable
population in this regard.

Shinde said that efforts should be made to spread awareness about heart
failure right across society, especially schoolchildren. “Even children
should have the knowledge that they need to adopt a healthy lifestyle to
avoid chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes,” he added.

are also empanelling private hospitals and cardiologists in the private
sector to help,” she said.

State medical education secretary Dr Sanjay Mukherjee said Maharashtra
has undertaken many initiatives to improve heart care. “We are
increasing the number of seats for super specialists this year onwards
so that we have better infrastructure for heart care,” he said. The
Maharashtra government has tied up with NGO Golden Hour Foundation to
train interns on the importance of golden hour in heart treatment.

Dr Mukherjee added that studies should be conducted to check if
artificial intelligence could help in identifying the vulnerable
population in this regard.

Shinde said that efforts should be made to spread awareness about heart
failure right across society, especially schoolchildren. “Even children
should have the knowledge that they need to adopt a healthy lifestyle to
avoid chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes,” he added.

India home to nearly 40% of world's heart failure patients

Highlight: Clinics, Registry Would Help Check New Epidemic Brought On By
Lifestyle Choices

Body

India is home to 40% of the world's 2.6 crore patients with heart
failure, yet there is poor awareness about the condition and its
treatment.

Maharashtra public health minister Eknath Shinde delivered this pithy
message while kickstarting the Times of India's initiative on heart
failure last week. Called the Beat Heart Failure, the initiative is
partnered by pharma major Novartis and aims to educate the masses about
heart failure and encourage them to undertake a basic symptom check.

The meeting—first in a series of discussions to be held in various
cities—was attended by select bureaucrats and academicians in Mumbai who
discussed ways to tackle this relatively new epidemic in India. Setting
up heart failure registry and starting heart failure clinics in medical
schools and private hospitals emerged as main solutions.

Dubbing the Beat Heart Failure campaign as an “essential” and “noble''
cause, Shinde said, “Heart failure is a challenge ahead of us as, more
so because Indians are prone to lifestyle diseases, like hypertension
and diabetes, that are risk factors for heart failure.”

He quoted a 2017 study that showed that only about 50% of India's heart
failure patients take medicines. “We need to work out a way ahead to
ensure that more patients are diagnosed early and started on treatment,”
he added.

KEM Hospital's cardiology department head Dr Prafulla Kerkar said the
problem of heart failure seems worse here because the condition
manifests a decade earlier among Indians. A problem vis-à-vis heart
failure is that no one is directly diagnosed as a heart failure patient
because it usually develops as a result of some other chronic condition.
“If a patient has diabetes or cardiovascular disease and has a low
ejection fraction (heart's pumping capacity), the patient has a high
risk of heart failure and should

undergo further diagnostic tests,” he added.

Dr Suresh Menon of Novartis said heart failure had a peculiar pattern.
“Most diseases start with an acute attack before the condition becomes
chronic, but it is the opposite with heart failure,” he said. Patients
first show up with chronic heart failure which becomes acute and needs
hospitalization, he added.

After understanding the details of India's heart failure epidemic that
the experts recommended setting up of a heart failure registry in
Maharashtra. At present, only Kerala has a heart failure registry funded
by the Indian Council for Medical Research.

Dr Amol Wankhede, a World Health Organisation advisor with the
Maharashtra government, felt heart failure could emerge as an epidemic
if measures aren't taken soon. “If not diagnosed early, patients will
require repeated ICU admissions,” he said, adding that the need of the
hour is setting up guidelines that even primary health centres could
follow. The idea is early identification so that patients can be rushed
for further treatment

to tertiary-care hospitals in urban areas.

Dr Sadhana Tayade, from the state director general of health services,
identified the lack of trained manpower as one of the impediments in
early diagnosis. “There is a scarcity of heart experts at the district
levels. There is only one MD-trained physicians for heart for 14
district hospitals,” she said. However, she added that government's
screening for non-communicable disease could help identify patients. “We
are also empanelling private hospitals and cardiologists in the private
sector to help,” she said.

State medical education secretary Dr Sanjay Mukherjee said Maharashtra

population in this regard.

Shinde said that efforts should be made to spread awareness about heart
failure right across society, especially schoolchildren. “Even children
should have the knowledge that they need to adopt a healthy lifestyle to
avoid chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes,” he added.

June 01 -- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has been robust in announcing
the start of domestic flights in India, keeping in mind the restrictions
and relaxations of Lockdown 4.0. In India, the corona cases have
increased, enumerating 83,004 on May 27, 2020. One reason for this is
minimal regulations to check on the influx of migrant workers through
Shramik Special trains. The government has taken a nominal step for the
regulation of corona spread in the form of Aarogya Setu App, to monitor
and screen positive cases in vicinity. However, blatant violations of
the procedure and narrow escapes were witnessed. Freshly released
guidelines for domestic flyers (asymptomatic passengers) will be allowed
to go with advice to self-monitor health for 14 days. On developing
symptoms, they should inform the District Surveillance Officer (DSO) or
the state/national call centre on 1075. Those on business trips and a
negative report shall be quarantined for seven days. However, this is
completely voluntary and does not carry any serious repercussions. The
Delhi-Adampur flight scheduled on May 24, 2020, saw failure for turn-up
of six passengers. Hence, starting flights between Jaipur-Adampur-Delhi,
will prove to be unsuccessful.

Book Review: Progress That Comes With Failure

It is a well-known maxim that 90 per cent of all startups fail. Failure
is important because it is at the heart of entrepreneurial success.
Thomas Edison, who failed a thousand times at inventing the light bulb
before succeeding, said "I didn't fail a thousand times. The light bulb
was an invention with a thousand steps."

The path to startup success, too, is paved with many mis-steps. However,
more gets written about success than failure because it is more
glamorous and comforting to read about. There is also a survivorship
bias where shining successes are more visible than the anonymous
struggles of failed businesses. Analysis of startups is often focused on
the end result, whether they failed or succeeded, and not on the
process, which is always a combination of failing and succeeding. This
focus results in definitive laundry lists of things to do or not to do
for achieving success and avoiding failure. Yet, handling failure is
important to achieving success. Laundry lists can provide useful but
incomplete advice to entrepreneurs that they must, among other things,
focus on their niche, be passionate, deliver great quality and believe
in themselves. However, it is this self-belief that gets severely tested
as entrepreneurs struggle through a journey that starts with them
achieving perfection in presentation, moves rapidly to them seeing their
business soaring on spreadsheets, and often ends up with them crashing
into cash flow statements that bleed red.

In Freedom to Fail, Shabnam Aggarwal reflects on her experience of
failure. It is a first person account of an entrepreneur who comes to
India from the US, turns her passion into a business and then plunges
headfirst into the chaos and nerve-racking uncertainty of trying to
succeed in India.

This is an intensely personal story of Aggarwal's journey from the idea
bulb that pops up in her head to the time she decides to turn the lights
off at Klever Kid, a marketplace for booking after-school activities.
She provides front row seats to observe her doubts, her fears, her joys
and her embarrassments, and weaves in vignettes of her personal life
that provide an insight into her motivations and personality. The
founder who appears calm and confident on the outside can be often be a
seething mass of conflicting emotions and insecurities inside. This
underscores the need for founders to focus on their mental and physical
wellbeing and to ensure that they have the emotional support necessary
to keep going as adversity piles up.

In a writing style that is breezy and humorous, the author describes her
experiences of everyday reality that any entrepreneur will identify
with. When you are driven by your vision of creating something larger
than yourself, mundane decisions like choosing what to wear to an
investor pitch or choosing office furniture appear momentous.

Most entrepreneurs start alone and quickly become used to handling
everything on their own. It is only when they cross the agonising stage
of convincing someone to invest in the business that the larger
existential issues start to overwhelm founders and they need a team to
step in. Early in her journey, Aggarwal is faced with the choice of
accepting unfavourable investment terms or closing down her business.
This is followed at regular intervals with challenges like key employees
leaving, customers not emptying out their pockets as projected and
investors running out of patience. At every setback, she tries to change
tactics and soldier on. However, she is soon back to staring at
financial statements and wondering how much longer the business has. One
of the first things an entrepreneur learns is how to count down to
Doomsday.

The author identifies the specific mistakes she made in her business and
rues the fact that often the realisation came too late. In any case,
since two business journeys are rarely similar, each entrepreneur will
end up learning her own business lessons from her failures. However, by
sensitising themselves to what failure feels like, aspiring founders,
especially those who have had early successes in academic life and
corporate careers, may be able to handle themselves and their
interactions with stakeholders better.

For most budding entrepreneurs, this book can be a flight simulator in
which to experience the emotions triggered by watching their businesses
falling apart and go crashing to the ground. There is also a lesson here
about having realistic expectations and contingency planning.

Startup journeys are too complex to fit into neat lists. Sure, you must
focus on a niche but how do you find it? Often, you stumble upon it.
It's here that failing fast can help. If you can recover quickly and try
something different then that failure has been worth the pain. To do
that, you need support from friends, family and investors. In other
words, you need the freedom to fail.

Albert Einstein said that "failure is success in progress". An
entrepreneur's life sees more failure than success. You win if you can
pick yourself up just one last time after you are thrown down.

2. Totals may not tally due to rounding off.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

1. Crude oil production byONGCin nomination block during August, 2020
was 1708.23 TMT which is 4.82% lower than target and 0.5% lower when
compared with August 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC
during April-August, 2020 was 8515.19 TMT which is 2.91% and 0.81% lower
than target for the period and production during corresponding period of
last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as
under:

* Production planned from WO16 cluster could not be realized due to
delay in MOPU (Sagar Samrat) as activities at GPC yard Abu Dhabi got
affected due to Covid restrictions/lockdown.

* Production planned from new wells in Ratna field affected due to non-
availability of ESPs due to implications of COVID-19.

* Production planned from new wells from Cluster-8 project has been
affected due to toppling of D-30-2 platform jacket during installation
and further delay in installation of new platforms due to COVID
implications.

2. Crudeoil production byOILin the nomination during August, 2020 was
242.98 TMT which is 9.62% lower than the monthly target and 11.43% lower
than the August, 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during
April-August, 2020 was 1239.98 TMT which is 4.63% and 8.47% lower than
target for the period and production during corresponding period of last
year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

* Less than planned contribution from workover and drilling wells.

* Less than planned contribution from Old well due to rise in water cut
in wells & decline in total liquid production of wells.

* Loss of oil production due to bandh/blockade by local people /union
/association after the blow out at BGN#5 and nearby areas.

3. Crude oil production byPvt/JVsin the PSC regime during August, 2020
was 626.28 TMT which is lower by 10.47% than the monthly target and
17.45% lower than August, 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by
Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2020 was 3131.09 TMT which is 7.33% and
17.30% lower than target for the period and production during
corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in
production are as under:

* RJ-ON-90/1 (Rajasthan Block): (1) Mangala - Near term impact of
pre-production and optimization jobs including zone conversions. (2)
Bhagyam - Higher PCP & electrical failures, delayed start-up full field
polymer injection etc. (3) Aishwarya - Delayed startup of polymer
injection in full field, lower UF VRR and additional downtime due to ESP
failure in 3 producer wells. (4) ABH - Delay in hookup of ABH Stage-2
wells. (5) Saraswati - Downtime due to frequent RSEB and DG breakdown on
Saraswati pad-1. (6) Gudda: No production in the field due to water
technical and maintenance issues. (CEIL)

* CY-ONN-2002/2: Development well MDDD with potential of 25 TPD couldn't
be drilled and completed. Decline in well MD-07 due to increase in GOR.
(ONGC)

* CB-ONN-2000/1: (1) Well PK#2 is not producing since Dec-2019 due to
possible casing damage and reservoir issues. (2) Well SE_DEV#1, SE#1A
and SE1#A1 is shut-in due to unavailability of effective demulsifier to
break tight water and oil emulsion. (3) Minor shortfall in production in
SRP operated well (PK2#A1, PK2#A2 & PL#1) due to power failure by UGVCL
(power distributer)." (GSPC)

* KG-ONN-2003/1: Less production due to shut in of well NAG-1Z-V2 for
additional HF jobs & remaining wells due to ullage problem (OTS at S
Yanam is not accepting crude). (ONGC)

* CB-ONN-2004/2 (Vadatal): Drilling of Two development wells in VD-3
discovery planned in Q1 FY 2020-21 could not be drilled. Envisaged
production from this well not realized. (ONGC)

2. Production of Natural Gas

Natural gas productionduring August, 2020 was 2431.69 MMSCM which is
14.24% lower than the monthly target and 9.54% lower when compared with
August, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production during April-August,
2020 was 11660.15 MMSCM which is 12.06% and 13.22% lower than target for
the period and production during corresponding period of last year
respectively. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given
atAnnexure-II.Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of August,

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production

1. Natural gas production byONGCin the nomination during August, 2020
was 1920.33 MMSCM which is 7.63% lower than target and 4.33% lower when
compared with August 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC
during April-August, 2020 was 9196.48 MMSCM which is 10.07% and 9.47%
lower than target for the period and production during corresponding
period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production
are as under:

* Production planned from WO16 cluster could not be realized due to
delay in MOPU (Sagar Samrat) as activities at GPC yard Abu Dhabi got
affected due to Covid restrictions/lockdown.

* Less than planned production from Vasistha/S1 wells in EOA due to
certain sub-surface issues.

* Non-realization of gain planned from new subsea wells in Bassein field
due to delay in subsea hook up jobs in view of Covid-19 implications.

2. Natural gas production byOILin the nomination during August, 2020 was
188.59 MMSCM which is 32.0% lower than monthly target and 20.40% lower
than August, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during
April-August, 2020 was 1041.14 MMSCM which is 18.66% and 9.68% lower
than target for the period and production during corresponding period of
last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as
under:

* Low Up-liftment by the major consumers due to various technical
issues.

* Loss of natural gas production due to bandh/blockade by local people
/union /association after the blow out at BGN#5 and nearby areas.

3. Natural gas production byPvt/JVsin the PSC regime during August, 2020
was 322.77 MMSCM which is 32.65% lower than monthly target and 27.31%
lower than August, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs
during April-August, 2020 was 1422.52 MMSCM which is 18.84% and 33.09%
lower than target for the period and production during corresponding
period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production
are as under:

* KG-DWN-98/3: The contractor has stated that the project progress of
R-Series D-34 field of KG-DWN-98/3 was on track till the outbreak of
COVID-19 pandemic and despite the pandemic constraints/lockdown, best
efforts are being made for start-up of R-Cluster (D34) project. (RIL)

* RJ-ON/6: Less offtake by buyer. (FEL).

* RJ-ON-90/1 (Rajasthan Block): RDG - Delay in new RDG plant start up
due to Covid-19. (CEIL)

* Sohagpur West: Dewatering wells gas breakout awaited, scaling in
producing wells and impact of COVID-19 lockdown. (RIL)

* KG-DWN-98/2 (U-3B): Well not producing as per the anticipated
profile.(ONGC)

production are as under:

* IOCL- Barauni, Mathura and Bongaigaon: Lower due to COVID-19 Pandemic
i.e. low product demand.

* IOCL-Gujarat & Panipat: Crude throughput regulated for high HSD stock
for low product demand due to COVID impact.

* IOCL-Haldia:Crude throughput regulated for high DHDS feed stock and
High HSD stock due to COVID impact.

* IOCL- Digboi:Crude throughput regulated due to high VR stock for high
DCU skin temperature.

* IOCL-Paradip:Crude throughput low due to planned shutdown deferred
from Jun-Jul'20 to Jul-Aug'20 and low product demand.

* HPCL-Mumbai & Visakh: Lower due to planned shutdown of secondary units
and impact of COVID situation.

* CPCL-Manali: Crude throughput lower due to lower product demand on
account of Covid-19 lockdown & M&I shutdown.

* MRPL-Mangalore: Lower due to Lower demand due to impact of COVID-19

India home to nearly 40% of world's heart failure patients

NEW DELHI: India is home to 40% of the world's 2.6 crore patients with
heart failure, yet there is poor awareness about the condition and its
treatment. Maharashtra public health minister Eknath Shinde delivered
this pithy message while kickstarting the Times of India's initiative on
heart failure last week. Called the Beat Heart Failure, the initiative
is partnered by pharma major Novartis and aims to educate the masses
about heart failure and encourage them to undertake a basic symptom
check.The meeting-first in a series of discussions to be held in various
cities-was attended by select bureaucrats and academicians in Mumbai who
discussed ways to tackle this relatively new epidemic in India. Setting
up heart failure registry and starting heart failure clinics in medical
schools and private hospitals emerged as main solutions.Maharashtra
public health minister Eknath Shinde kickstarts the Times of India's
initiative on heart failure Dubbing the Beat Heart Failure campaign as
an "essential" and "noble'' cause, Shinde said, "Heart failure is a
challenge ahead of us as, more so because Indians are prone to lifestyle
diseases, like hypertension and diabetes, that are risk factors for
heart failure."He quoted a 2017 study that showed that only about 50% of
India's heart failure patients take medicines.

"We need to work out a way ahead to ensure that more patients are
diagnosed early and started on treatment," he added.Dr Amol Wankhede
(from left), Dr Sadhana Tayade, Dr Prafulla Kerkar, Dr Sanjay Mukherjee
and Dr Suresh Menon at the Beat Heart Failure discussionKEM Hospital's
cardiology department head Dr Prafulla Kerkar said the problem of heart
failure seems worse here because the condition manifests a decade
earlier among Indians. A problem vis--vis heart failure is that no one
is directly diagnosed as a heart failure patient because it usually
develops as a result of some other chronic condition. "If a patient has
diabetes or cardiovascular disease and has a low ejection fraction
(heart's pumping capacity), the patient has a high risk of heart failure
and should undergo further diagnostic tests," he added.Dr Suresh Menon
of Novartis said heart failure had a peculiar pattern. "Most diseases
start with an acute attack before the condition becomes chronic, but it
is the opposite with heart failure," he said. Patients first show up
with chronic heart failure which becomes acute and needs
hospitalization, he added.After understanding the details of India's
heart failure epidemic that the experts recommended setting up of a
heart failure registry in Maharashtra. At present, only Kerala has a
heart failure registry funded by the Indian Council for Medical
Research.Dr Amol Wankhede, a World Health Organisation advisor with the
Maharashtra government, felt heart failure could emerge as an epidemic
if measures aren't taken soon. "If not diagnosed early, patients will
require repeated ICU admissions," he said, adding that the need of the
hour is setting up guidelines that even primary health centres could
follow. The idea is early identification so that patients can be rushed
for further treatment to tertiarycare hospitals in urban areas.Dr
Sadhana Tayade, from the state director general of health services,
identified the lack of trained manpower as one of the impediments in
early diagnosis. "There is a scarcity of heart experts at the district
levels. There is only one MD-trained physicians for heart for 14
district hospitals," she said. However, she added that government's
screening for non-communicable disease could help identify patients. "We
are also empanelling private hospitals and cardiologists in the private
sector to help," she said.State medical education secretary Dr Sanjay
Mukherjee said Maharashtra has undertaken many initiatives to improve
heart care. "We are increasing the number of seats for super specialists
this year onwards so that we have better infrastructure for heart care,"
he said. The Maharashtra government has tied up with NGO Golden Hour
Foundation to train interns on the importance of golden hour in heart
treatment.Dr Mukherjee added that studies should be conducted to check
if artificial intelligence could help in identifying the vulnerable
population in this regard.Shinde said that efforts should be made to
spread awareness about heart failure right across society, especially
schoolchildren. "Even children should have the knowledge that they need
to adopt a healthy lifestyle to avoid chronic conditions like
hypertension and diabetes," he added. For Reprint Rights:

YourStory, in association with Zoho, organised the 'Secrets of Scaling
Up in 2020' conference on December 13, 2019 at Le Meridien, Kochi. The
conference brought together over 180+ startup founders, successful
entrepreneurs and business leaders from the region and across India to
discuss their experiences and debate issues that need to be tackled to
scale up in the right way.

The event began with a welcome note by Honey Bengani, Business Head,
YourStory, followed by an inaugural address by Dr R. Nandagopal,
Director, Xavier Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship (XIME)
Kochi.

The keynote address was delivered by Saji Gopinath, CEO, Kerala Startup
Mission. He took the audience through an analysis of how
entrepreneurship has evolved from a few years ago to the present state
of the ecosystem, and what the future holds. As part of a special
initiative to empower women in the industry, Saji said the Kerala
Startup Mission plans to implement 'Kerala Women in Nano Startup'
project.

"Although Kerala women are talented and qualified, their potential is
not fully utilised in the industry sector. Entrepreneurship among women
in Kerala is only 11 percent now. With the implementation of the
project, their share can be enhanced," he said.

Kerala, once considered as an industry-unfriendly state, has 25
companies with a national and international reputation. This transition
signifies that even with scarcity of land to build industrial units,
Kerala can perform well. Startups are developing solutions in newer ways
thanks to a whole host of support systems and infrastructure in place.
Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) offers entrepreneurs in the state,
exposure to the national and international startup ecosystem,
state-of-the-art facilities, mentoring, networking opportunities,
industry connects, R&D support and more. So far, 619 startups have
registered, out of which 175 are seed-funded startups, 7 are
venture-funded and 6 of them are supported by incubators. The platform
has 303 incubatees who enable growth for technopreneurs and business
enterprises.

TiE Kerala is one of the most active chapters in the TiE Global network
and has been closely associated with KSUM in promoting the startup
ecosystem in Kerala, with many of its Charter members offering voluntary
mentoring and strategic support to nurture early-stage entrepreneurs.
KSUM and TiE Kerala have also jointly initiated several successful
programs such as mentoring masterclasses, startup showcases, failure
labs, meetup cafe, etc.

Anand Chari, Deputy General Manager, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) SME,
also spoke on the modalities for startups to get listed on the BSE.
"Trust is essential for an investor to invest in any unit and Kerala
startups have seen plenty of investments," he said.

This was followed by an engaging fireside chat 'Basics Brand Story' by
Balachandar, Co-founder, Wassup Laundry with Suhail Sattar, Co-founder,
Basics. There were insightful talks by Beena Kannan, CEO, Seematti, who
shared the secrets of scaling up in 2020, and C Balagopal, Founder and
Advisor, Terumo Penpol, who spoke about entrepreneurship and its way
forward in Kerala. Balagopal has identified 50 manufacturing industries
in Kerala who are operating well and have footprints across the globe.
"People complain about starting up in Kerala, but there are challenges
everywhere. Despite that, I've observed that there are several brands
and companies based in Kerala who are performing extremely well," he
said.

The conference also featured an award ceremony to recognise
entrepreneurs, brands and governmental organisations in Kerala who were
enabling innovation and creating an impact. The winners in each category
are as follows:

RISING BRANDS OF KERALA

* Rapidor - A B2B application that helps in creating and managing
orders, crafting crisp product catalogues, controlling inventory,
overseeing payment processes and empowering the dealer-manufacturer
equation.

* GenRobotics - Specialises in best-in-class design and development of
robotic solutions and Artificial Intelligence to address the most
pressing social issues.

* NavAlt Solar and Electric Boats - A joint venture between Navgathi
India, AltEn France and EVE Systems France to build large solar,
electric and hybrid boats for India under 'Make In India'.

INSPIRING ENTREPRENEUR

C Balagopal, Founder and Advisor, Terumo Penpol - He was the Founding
Managing Director of Penpol, which he later sold it to a Japanese
company Terumo, and hence the name Terumo Penpol. A well-known
entrepreneur, he now works closely with and advises startups across
India.

ECOSYSTEM ENABLERS

* TiE Kerala - Global not-for-profit organization focused on promoting
entrepreneurship.

* Kerala Startup Mission - India's first and most successful
non-academic business incubator to help technology business startups.

Prior to the conference, a workshop on 'Adopting Technology as you Set
Up, Start Off and Scale Up' was organised by Zoho. The networking dinner
saw startups discussing their entrepreneurial challenges and taking tips
from the speakers and fellow entrepreneurs.

Reflections on the huge challenge created by SA’s jobless youths

YOUTH month has come and gone. It is thus compelling to reflect on the
challenges facing South Africa’s youth – top of which is unemployment.

According to Statistics South Africa’s (StatsSA) Quarterly Labour Force
for the first quarter of 2021, South Africa’s unemployment rate stood at
32.6 percent. This rate was 46.3 percent among young people aged 15 to
34 years, implying that almost one in every two young people in the
labour force did not have a job in the first quarter of 2021.

About a quarter, 24.4 percent, of the youth have jobs, and 45.3 percent
participate in the labour market. Within the youth, those aged 15 to 24
are more vulnerable in the labour market with an unemployment rate of
more than 63 percent, an absorption rate of about 7.6 percent and a
labour force participation rate of 20.6 percent.

This scenario is dire and begs the question? How is it that the youthful
segment of our population – a latent demographic dividend – has now
morphed into a challenge that could result in people being left behind
and the skills of dynamic and future focused young people being
underutilised?

In fairness, weak economic growth averaging 1.5 percent that has
characterised the local economy for the last 10 years has conspired to
keep many a youth out of gainful employment. Yet from my vantage, I’m
circumspect about apportioning entire blame on the country’s
unemployment problem to tepid growth. While our economy has not
performed well to achieve growth that absorbs the increasing youth
population, the South African challenge comprises a blended mix of
factors.

For its part, the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) approved R3.9
billion in funding to youth-empowered enterprises over the past five
years.

The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition’s recent Black
Industrialists report shows that the dtic in partnership with its
funding agencies, the IDC and National Empowerment Fund, collectively
approved R32.6bn in funding support for more than 900 black
industrialists over the past five years – some of whom include
youth-empowered enterprises. This figure excludes private sector funding
and other support to youth-owned and empowered enterprises.

Our interface with youth whose business applications we are constantly
processing gives us a glimpse into their challenges. In fairness, some
of these businesses we have funded over the period have grown
significantly. However, some have battled to maintain a consistent
revenue momentum. We have proactively provided business support services
to assist and prevent failure. Against the number of private and public
funding institutions readily available to assist entrepreneurs, it is
tempting to interrogate the following: What is the state of
entrepreneurship in our country, and how do our youth fair in
entrepreneurship compared to their peers in middle-income and other
developing countries?

Despite available public-private partnerships supporting Small Medium
Enterprises and a range of corporate-run small business support
initiatives, South Africa has low levels of entrepreneurial activity
compared to other developing countries.

According to a Global Entrepreneurship report, South Africa has a 70 to
80 percent failure rate for start-ups in the first five years of
business. And most local youth-owned businesses fall into this category.

This view is reinforced by Cova Advisory – a specialist business
advisory service that argues that five out of seven local Small, Medium
and Macro Enterprises in South Africa tend to fail within the first
year.

Funding constraints aside, the lack of mentorship support, business
inexperience, failure to comprehend market dynamics and inability to tap
into a thriving ecosystem of trending digital services rank as some of
the biggest challenges facing local youth-owned businesses.

Hand-holding or shadowing established business owners that have
traversed the entrepreneurship terrain is critical to aspiring
entrepreneurs. Through this process, valuable lessons are taught, and
the experience by the established guard is passed on to aspiring
entrepreneurs. Our experience suggests that these factors are lacking on
a large scale.

While great to test new ideas, it is also vital to test viability.
Simply put, a product that easily sells in India or the US might not
appeal to South Africa’s populace. The viability of a business is
critical to maintaining revenue streams, and this factor is critical to
the IDC approving a funding application.

Further to this, is our secondary and tertiary education curriculum
contributing positively to producing graduates that are ready to take on
the entrepreneurship mantle?

Producing graduates that are only ready for absorption into the
workplace is different to educating a generation of entrepreneurs
capable of positively contributing to resolving South Africa’s youth
unemployment challenge.

Enhancing the curriculum of both secondary and tertiary education to one
that provides entrepreneurial skills for the current business landscape
as well as one that meets the demands of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution, among others, will be vital for graduates to become drivers
of job creation.

As some green shoots begin to emerge and we recover from the impact of
the pandemic, a synopsis of South Africa’s economy points to a
transformed economy. We need to ensure our youth benefit from
opportunities emanating from the government’s economic recovery and
reconstruction plan. This is impossible to achieve without business
experience and the requisite skills set.

How can you stay open to listening and learning new ideas after tasting
massive wins?

Nextbigwhat.com

March 26, 2021 Friday

Copyright 2021 Pi All Rights Reserved

Length: 506 words

Dateline: India

India, March 26 -- Not just product managers, but founders and
marketers - and pretty much all the important roles in the org are
subjected to confirmation bias, the *I know-it-all* bias, and
'this-is-how-it-works' bias.

For example, if you have had a very successful run with the launch of a
product, the chances are that you will be 100% confident that the next
few product launches will be super hits, in fact much better than the
previous ones.

Why? Because you know how-it-works. How the system works. You know the
taste of the audience. Well, at least you think so.

Remember Nokia? Blackberry? Ouch.... Let's move on.

How does one stay open to new ideas, then?

Practically speaking, most successful managers/leaders end up
surrounding themselves with yes-(wo)men and that just adds very
significantly to the *I-am-inevitable* syndrome.

How can one break free from this?

The simplest way to keep learning new ideas is to surround yourself with
people who are talking and implementing new ideas.

Where do you find them? Outside your comfort zone. Outside your office.
Outside your current network.

What does that mean? How do I figure this out?

Few things:

UnStage Yourself !

Learn to be in the audience (and not just the speaker).

What do I mean? After a point, most *accomplished* professionals stop
attending any event/meetup/workshops (online or offline) as an audience.

If you are always the smartest person in the room (i.e. talking and
dispersing gyaan), you are definitely not learning. Some of the amazing
leaders I know are often attending random Clubhouse events to Zoom
webinars to learn and get more perspective from others.

Learn to be an audience. And a great one at it. The first step towards
being curious is to become a true learner.

Set yourself up for failure (outside work.. to start with) !

Of course, I won't recommend trying out this in your core job - but try
to set yourself up for failure outside your work.

For instance, start writing if you aren't doing so. It not only improves
your clarity and gets better at work (read: Why Product managers should
write). But if writing is not your thing, start a TikTok channel or a
podcast or whatever - that keeps you in front of an audience and opens
yourself to be judged (and laughed upon).

Congratulations on swallowing up all your ego and pride

Mingle with Younger Colleagues

Seriously. All the great disruption is happening there.

Plus, culturally, one needs to be a lot more aware of the new new world,
and the only way to do is to become good friends with your younger
colleagues.

The new jargons/lingos to how they consume products/think of new tech -
all of that is a mini-crash course in itself!

Last, but not the least.

Up-skill yourself. Everyday.

And the simplest way to go about this is by signing up for a product
(FWD app) that helps you move FWD daily.

Happy Learning !

11 investors predict a colorful, if difficult, future for psychedelic

How far has the psychedelics medicines industry come over the past 12
months? Well, it depends on where you look. If you look at the stock
market, the view isn't very good: the charts are all down and in the
red, and all you can see are psychedelics companies tottering by, doing
their best to impress cynical investors. Similar to most other sectors
today, that crumbling of confidence in the sector has trickled down to
the private markets as well, slowing down venture dealmaking and further
shrinking deal sizes in an already parched venture market. But if you
focus and leave your preconceptions behind, you'll find that beyond the
skein of valuations and share prices, there is a world of spirited
dealmaking, ripe with impetus for building a sustainable industry.

A recent survey by TechCrunch+ indicates that investors and founders
are, instead of simply looking for attractive opportunities,
increasingly putting their minds to building the foundations for an
industry that can employ the power of psychedelics to change lives. For
Bek Muslimov and Nikolay Tretiyakov, co-founding partners at Leafy
Tunnel, the problems currently being tackled by the industry are proof
of the nascent sector's progress. "The questions our industry is
grappling with are becoming more refined and nuanced, reflecting the
necessary maturation. Amongst these questions are actual costs of
therapies, reimbursement coverage, the commercialisation strategy for
psychedelic drug development companies, resource bottlenecks with the
therapists' supply and infrastructure, etc," they told TechCrunch+.
We're widening our lens, looking for more investors to participate in
TechCrunch surveys, where we poll top professionals about challenges in
their industry. If you're an investor and would like to participate in
future surveys, fill out this form. Regulation is moving forward, too,
albeit slowly, with only Oregon and Colorado taking steps to partially
decriminalize psychedelics. But even as the industry looks to those
states to serve as testbeds for everything from drug development to
integration into the healthcare infrastructure, several investors
pointed out that the U.S. is not the only place where psychedelics are
seeing interest. "Decriminalization is not the same as legalization at
the Federal level. I believe we will continue to see international
locations as primary testbeds as the larger question of legalization in
the U.S. is discussed," said Amy Kruse, chief investment officer, Satori
Neuro. "The developments in Australia this year are extremely
interesting and worth watching closely. As Australia is often a site for
clinical trials research in the psychedelic medicine ecosystem, it will
be worth watching to see how this develops. Will they take the lead?"
Like several investors we surveyed, Kruse doesn't solely invest in
psychedelics, but they are very much on her radar. The firm she's part
of, Satori Neuro, is a new venture that aims to invest in solutions to
address mental health challenges, including psychedelic medicine. But
she and her ilk are among the few investors willing to enter the space,
as the majority of investors, especially institutions, still labor under
misapprehensions about psychedelics or aren't interested in risking
their money or reputation. "For most institutional investors,
psychedelics continue to be a 'no can do' sector to invest in," said
Sa'ad Shah, managing partner at Noetic Fund. "While we can certainly
argue for the major strides made and progress on the regulatory front,
institutions still need to see it to believe it. Secondly, this sector
is still too small. It does not warrant the kind of capital that most
institutional investors typically put to work." When this could change
likely depends on how regulation is framed and how the healthcare
industry responds to advances in the space. But that's not to say the
path to commercialization and wider adoption is closed to psychedelic
startups and investors at the moment. Tim Schlidt, co-founder and
partner at Palo Santo, explained it succinctly: "Rather than seeking to
change how our healthcare system operates, we believe this early
generation of psychedelics must transform and adapt to fit within
existing infrastructure. Rather than trying to storm the ramparts, we
believe a Trojan horse approach is the only means by which these
therapies can achieve wide-scale adoption." Read on to learn about where
these investors are placing their bets, how they decide which companies
to back, what are the prospects for M&A in the space, how to best
approach them, and more. We spoke with: How has the trajectory of listed
psychedelics companies affected private firms and start-ups? Listed
psychedelics companies were highly overvalued in 2021, and the
correction in the markets has brought valuations for private companies
back to more standard early-stage levels. Investors are more prudent
with capital today, allowing capable founders and teams working on a
great product with a good business plan to shine through rather than
being drowned out by the noise. The adjustment of expectations from
investors also allows private companies to grow organically and make
decisions with good counsel. At the same time, generalist investors
burned by investing in bad apples could now have developed an adverse
view to investments in the space, costing good companies backed by deep
tech venture firms access to additional pools of capital. The inability
to raise more capital in this environment has caused many good companies
to shelve or halt promising programs and prioritize survival over rapid
growth. Other than disagreements over prices, which factors have impeded
M&A activity in the psychedelic space in the last 12 months? There are
three main factors impeding M&A activity: Drug development is very
costly, and start-ups are having a harder time raising cash. Does this
make psychedelics startups that aren't developing any drugs more
attractive to investors than those involved in drug development?
Business models that can generate revenues with low burn rates have
always been more attractive to the traditional investor than non-revenue
generating businesses like drug development. However, there are
investors who still understand the unique risk-reward profile in each
case, and hence, founders need to be able to approach the right
investor. There are drug development companies that continue to raise
capital at higher valuations due to the continued validation of efficacy
and the "optionality" that exists in their program - i.e. they are
pursuing several promising leads/molecular pathways. What is riskier,
especially at this point in time, are pure drug discovery companies that
don't have any leads to take into trials anytime soon. Whether
developing a drug or not, a company would be attractive to investors if
and only if it is addressing a key problem in the market that cannot
already be solved by incumbents efficiently. Several non-drug
development companies touting to be "specific to the psychedelic
industry" would only be successful in the long term if they have a
unique and differentiating value proposition, can develop a sustained
economic moat, have a proven track record of raising capital, and have
the right team to execute. How has your approach to the psychedelics
sector changed since our previous psychedelics survey a year ago? Our
view of the markets from a year ago has only been validated by what has
transpired in the psychedelics market. Our overall focus is and has
always been on central nervous system (CNS), and we are agnostic as to
the modality, be it psychedelic drug development, other pharmacological
approaches, medtech devices, or digital therapeutics. When it comes to
the psychedelics sector in particular, we feel this industry has clearly
matured from being a toddler in its terrible twos to an adolescent, but
there is still a long way to go. We continue to focus on the
non-hallucinogenic approach to psychedelics, as it has the most
promising prospects of being commercialized with much less scrutiny
while adhering to current standards of care. We were not surprised by
the closure of several ketamine clinics, as we stated last year that
given the industry's life cycle, we are too early for "downstream"
opportunities to have a viable chance of succeeding. What we weren't
expecting was the level of headwinds the markets are facing overall,
which is affecting money-good companies from raising additional capital
to shepherd their plans through. This is very much a Darwinian model
being played out. The strong and most adaptable are the ones that will
survive. We have to accept that the failure rates for a startup in a new
industry such as ours will be high, especially in light of the macro
backdrop. As such, our approach is to have a high-conviction portfolio
and lean on/back the companies that have the ability to execute well in
any given environment. We also feel that the simple 'pick a molecule and
an indication' strategy that was easily funded in 2020/2021 will go
extinct, as it is not a viable business model. To survive, you must show
safety and efficacy, protect your IP, be differentiated, and have a team
that can execute on the science and business in order to commercialize
and scale. Colorado and Oregon voted to partially decriminalize
psychedelics, but there are caveats. Should these U.S. states be
considered testbeds for what might happen in this space globally? Why or
why not? If we want to talk about testbeds, we should first and foremost
look at Australia, which has been the first out of the gate to legalize
MDMA and Psilocybin for therapeutic use under proper protocol and
compliance. In jurisdictions where psychedelics are being
decriminalized, it is likely that psychedelic-naïve individuals would
access psychedelics outside of the medical system. To reduce any
unforeseen risks in these cases, it is imperative that effective
pre-screening protocols and post-session psychotherapy and support be
implemented to ensure people have safe and effective access.
Additionally, a reliable source of information to educate individuals
would be required. It is therefore our goal to focus on the regulated
paths (e.g., FDA, EMA, Health Canada) to usher in psychedelic-assisted
psychotherapy to patients in a safe, efficacious and accessible manner.
It is imperative that the decriminalization process ensures that the
right safety checks are in place. This requires proper education about
psychedelics and safe protocols to follow.

How far has the psychedelics medicines industry come over the past 12
months? Well, it depends on where you look. If you look at the stock
market, the view isn't very good: the charts are all down and in the
red, and all you can see are psychedelics companies tottering by, doing
their best to impress cynical investors. Similar to most other sectors
today, that crumbling of confidence in the sector has trickled down to
the private markets as well, slowing down venture dealmaking and further
shrinking deal sizes in an already parched venture market. But if you
focus and leave your preconceptions behind, you'll find that beyond the
skein of valuations and share prices, there is a world of spirited
dealmaking, ripe with impetus for building a sustainable industry.

A recent survey by TechCrunch+ indicates that investors and founders

path to commercialization and wider adoption is closed to psychedelic
startups and investors at the moment. Tim Schlidt, co-founder and
partner at Palo Santo, explained it succinctly: "Rather than seeking to
change how our healthcare system operates, we believe this early
generation of psychedelics must transform and adapt to fit within
existing infrastructure. Rather than trying to storm the ramparts, we
believe a Trojan horse approach is the only means by which these
therapies can achieve wide-scale adoption." Read on to learn about where
these investors are placing their bets, how they decide which companies
to back, what are the prospects for M&A in the space, how to best
approach them, and more. We spoke with: How has the trajectory of listed
psychedelics companies affected private firms and start-ups? Listed
psychedelics companies were highly overvalued in 2021, and the
correction in the markets has brought valuations for private companies
back to more standard early-stage levels. Investors are more prudent
with capital today, allowing capable founders and teams working on a
great product with a good business plan to shine through rather than
being drowned out by the noise. The adjustment of expectations from
investors also allows private companies to grow organically and make
decisions with good counsel. At the same time, generalist investors
burned by investing in bad apples could now have developed an adverse
view to investments in the space, costing good companies backed by deep
tech venture firms access to additional pools of capital. The inability
to raise more capital in this environment has caused many good companies
to shelve or halt promising programs and prioritize survival over rapid
growth. Other than disagreements over prices, which factors have impeded
M&A activity in the psychedelic space in the last 12 months? There are
three main factors impeding M&A activity: Drug development is very
costly, and start-ups are having a harder time raising cash. Does this
make psychedelics startups that aren't developing any drugs more
attractive to investors than those involved in drug development?
Business models that can generate revenues with low burn rates have
always been more attractive to the traditional investor than non-revenue
generating businesses like drug development. However, there are
investors who still understand the unique risk-reward profile in each
case, and hence, founders need to be able to approach the right
investor. There are drug development companies that continue to raise
capital at higher valuations due to the continued validation of efficacy
and the "optionality" that exists in their program - i.e. they are
pursuing several promising leads/molecular pathways. What is riskier,
especially at this point in time, are pure drug discovery companies that
don't have any leads to take into trials anytime soon. Whether
developing a drug or not, a company would be attractive to investors if
and only if it is addressing a key problem in the market that cannot
already be solved by incumbents efficiently. Several non-drug
development companies touting to be "specific to the psychedelic
industry" would only be successful in the long term if they have a
unique and differentiating value proposition, can develop a sustained
economic moat, have a proven track record of raising capital, and have
the right team to execute. How has your approach to the psychedelics
sector changed since our previous psychedelics survey a year ago? Our
view of the markets from a year ago has only been validated by what has
transpired in the psychedelics market. Our overall focus is and has
always been on central nervous system (CNS), and we are agnostic as to
the modality, be it psychedelic drug development, other pharmacological
approaches, medtech devices, or digital therapeutics. When it comes to
the psychedelics sector in particular, we feel this industry has clearly
matured from being a toddler in its terrible twos to an adolescent, but
there is still a long way to go. We continue to focus on the
non-hallucinogenic approach to psychedelics, as it has the most
promising prospects of being commercialized with much less scrutiny
while adhering to current standards of care. We were not surprised by
the closure of several ketamine clinics, as we stated last year that
given the industry's life cycle, we are too early for "downstream"
opportunities to have a viable chance of succeeding. What we weren't
expecting was the level of headwinds the markets are facing overall,
which is affecting money-good companies from raising additional capital
to shepherd their plans through. This is very much a Darwinian model
being played out. The strong and most adaptable are the ones that will
survive. We have to accept that the failure rates for a startup in a new
industry such as ours will be high, especially in light of the macro
backdrop. As such, our approach is to have a high-conviction portfolio
and lean on/back the companies that have the ability to execute well in
any given environment. We also feel that the simple 'pick a molecule and
an indication' strategy that was easily funded in 2020/2021 will go
extinct, as it is not a viable business model. To survive, you must show
safety and efficacy, protect your IP, be differentiated, and have a team
that can execute on the science and business in order to commercialize
and scale. Colorado and Oregon voted to partially decriminalize
psychedelics, but there are caveats. Should these U.S. states be
considered testbeds for what might happen in this space globally? Why or
why not? If we want to talk about testbeds, we should first and foremost
look at Australia, which has been the first out of the gate to legalize
MDMA and Psilocybin for therapeutic use under proper protocol and
compliance. In jurisdictions where psychedelics are being
decriminalized, it is likely that psychedelic-naïve individuals would
access psychedelics outside of the medical system. To reduce any
unforeseen risks in these cases, it is imperative that effective
pre-screening protocols and post-session psychotherapy and support be
implemented to ensure people have safe and effective access.
Additionally, a reliable source of information to educate individuals
would be required. It is therefore our goal to focus on the regulated
paths (e.g., FDA, EMA, Health Canada) to usher in psychedelic-assisted
psychotherapy to patients in a safe, efficacious and accessible manner.
It is imperative that the decriminalization process ensures that the
right safety checks are in place. This requires proper education about
psychedelics and safe protocols to follow.

11 investors predict a colorful, if difficult, future for psychedelic
startups

How far has the psychedelics medicines industry come over the past 12
months? Well, it depends on where you look. If you look at the stock
market, the view isn't very good: the charts are all down and in the
red, and all you can see are psychedelics companies tottering by, doing
their best to impress cynical investors. Similar to most other sectors
today, that crumbling of confidence in the sector has trickled down to
the private markets as well, slowing down venture dealmaking and further
shrinking deal sizes in an already parched venture market. But if you
focus and leave your preconceptions behind, you'll find that beyond the
skein of valuations and share prices, there is a world of spirited
dealmaking, ripe with impetus for building a sustainable industry.

A recent survey by TechCrunch+ indicates that investors and founders
are, instead of simply looking for attractive opportunities,
increasingly putting their minds to building the foundations for an
industry that can employ the power of psychedelics to change lives. For
Bek Muslimov and Nikolay Tretiyakov, co-founding partners at Leafy
Tunnel, the problems currently being tackled by the industry are proof
of the nascent sector's progress. "The questions our industry is
grappling with are becoming more refined and nuanced, reflecting the
necessary maturation. Amongst these questions are actual costs of
therapies, reimbursement coverage, the commercialisation strategy for
psychedelic drug development companies, resource bottlenecks with the
therapists' supply and infrastructure, etc," they told TechCrunch+.
We're widening our lens, looking for more investors to participate in
TechCrunch surveys, where we poll top professionals about challenges in
their industry. If you're an investor and would like to participate in
future surveys, fill out this form. Regulation is moving forward, too,
albeit slowly, with only Oregon and Colorado taking steps to partially
decriminalize psychedelics. But even as the industry looks to those
states to serve as testbeds for everything from drug development to
integration into the healthcare infrastructure, several investors
pointed out that the U.S. is not the only place where psychedelics are
seeing interest. "Decriminalization is not the same as legalization at
the Federal level. I believe we will continue to see international
locations as primary testbeds as the larger question of legalization in
the U.S. is discussed," said Amy Kruse, chief investment officer, Satori
Neuro. "The developments in Australia this year are extremely
interesting and worth watching closely. As Australia is often a site for
clinical trials research in the psychedelic medicine ecosystem, it will
be worth watching to see how this develops. Will they take the lead?"
Like several investors we surveyed, Kruse doesn't solely invest in
psychedelics, but they are very much on her radar. The firm she's part
of, Satori Neuro, is a new venture that aims to invest in solutions to
address mental health challenges, including psychedelic medicine. But
she and her ilk are among the few investors willing to enter the space,
as the majority of investors, especially institutions, still labor under
misapprehensions about psychedelics or aren't interested in risking
their money or reputation. "For most institutional investors,
psychedelics continue to be a 'no can do' sector to invest in," said
Sa'ad Shah, managing partner at Noetic Fund. "While we can certainly
argue for the major strides made and progress on the regulatory front,
institutions still need to see it to believe it. Secondly, this sector
is still too small. It does not warrant the kind of capital that most
institutional investors typically put to work." When this could change
likely depends on how regulation is framed and how the healthcare
industry responds to advances in the space. But that's not to say the
path to commercialization and wider adoption is closed to psychedelic
startups and investors at the moment. Tim Schlidt, co-founder and
partner at Palo Santo, explained it succinctly: "Rather than seeking to
change how our healthcare system operates, we believe this early
generation of psychedelics must transform and adapt to fit within
existing infrastructure. Rather than trying to storm the ramparts, we
believe a Trojan horse approach is the only means by which these
therapies can achieve wide-scale adoption." Read on to learn about where

BJP leaders running away from polls for fear of defeat: Cong

The Times of India (TOI)

Dehradun: Following former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat's
announcement that he won't contest polls this time, the Uttarakhand unit
of Congress has said BJP leaders are shying away from contesting polls
for fear of losing. According to Congress, several sitting BJP MLAs
would not be given tickets this time for non-performance.

Uttarakhand Congress spokesperson, Garima Dasauni, told TOI, "The BJP
itself has specified that some of its MLAs will not be given tickets.
The saffron party is aware that several of its MLAs have been
non-performers. Consequently, the party is bringing in new candidates to
reduce the anti-incumbency." On Tuesday (January 18), Trivendra wrote a
letter to BJP chief JP Nadda informing the latter of his decision to
back out from polls. He, however, added that he will support the BJP
candidate from the Doiwala constituency. In regard to the letter,
Dasauni has said that it is nothing but the former CM trying to hide his
failure. "He gave up before the race even started... On one hand, he is
not contesting the election and on the other, he feels that his
campaigning will help the BJP. This is self-contradictory," she
said.Meanwhile, Congress general secretary (organisation), Mathura Dutt
Joshi, said that the Trivendra episode is just the start and more BJP
MLAs will either back out themselves or be denied poll ticket by the
party for their non-performance. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Silicon Valley Bank shut down by regulator, 2nd biggest US lender
failure in history

Startup-focused lender SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) became the largest
bank failure since the financial crisis on Friday, in a sudden collapse
that roiled global markets and stranded billions of dollars belonging to
companies and investors. California banking regulators closed the bank,
which did business as Silicon Valley Bank, on Friday and appointed the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver for later
disposition of its assets. The main office and all branches of Silicon
Valley Bank will reopen on March 13 and all insured depositors will have
full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, the
FDIC said. But 89% of the bank's $175 billion in deposits were uninsured
as the end of 2022, according to the FDIC, and their fate remains to be
determined. Companies such as video game maker Roblox Corp RBLX.N and
streaming device maker Roku Inc (ROKU.O) said they had hundreds of
millions of deposits at the bank. Roku said its deposits with SVB were
largely uninsured, sending its shares down 10% in extended trading.
Technology workers whose paychecks relied on the bank were also worried
about getting their wages on Friday. An SVB branch in San Francisco
showed a note taped to the door telling clients to call a toll-free
telephone number.

The FDIC said it would seek to sell SVB's assets and that future
dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors. At times in the
past, the FDIC has moved quickly, even striking deals to sell major
banks over the weekend. SVB did not respond to calls for comment. The
collapse sent shockwaves through the startup community, which has come
to view the lender as a source of reliable capital. The bank's customers
were met with locked doors on Friday. A client dashboard was down, a
UK-based client of the bank told Reuters. Dean Nelson, CEO of Cato
Digital, was on a line outside of SVB Santa Clara headquarters, hoping
to get answers. Nelson said he was worried about the company's ability
to pay employees and cover expenses. "Access to the cash is the biggest
problem for the majority of the companies here. If you're a startup,
cash is king. The cash and the workflow, to be able to have the runway
is critical." The problems at SVB, which quickly escalated after the
bank said on Wednesday it would raise money, underscore how a campaign
by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks to fight inflation by
ending the era of cheap money is exposing vulnerabilities in the market.
The worries walloped the banking sector. US banks have lost over $100
billion in stock market value over the past two days, with European
banks losing around another $50 billion in value, according to a Reuters
calculation. Regional banks sold off on Friday. US lenders First
Republic Bank (FRC.N) and Western Alliance (WAL.N) said on Friday their
liquidity and deposits remained strong, aiming to calm investors as
their shares fell. Others such as Germany's Commerzbank CBKG.DE issued
unusual statements to reassure investors. Some analysts forecast more
pain for the sector as the episode spread concern about hidden risks in
the banking sector and its vulnerability to the rising cost of money.
"There could be a bloodbath next week as banks are in trouble, the short
sellers are out there and they are going to attack every single bank,
especially the smaller ones," said Christopher Whalen, chairman of
Whalen Global Advisors. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with
banking regulators on Friday expressed "full confidence" in their
abilities to respond to the situation, Treasury said. The White House on
Friday said it had faith and confidence in U.S. financial regulators,
when asked about the failure of SVB. Cecilia Rouse, who chairs the
Council of Economic Advisers, said the U.S. banking system was
fundamentally stronger than it was during the 2008 financial crisis.

semiconductors gap

"The first bank failure since 2020 is a wake-up call," said Matthew
Goldberg, an analyst at Bankrate. The genesis of SVB's collapse lies in
a rising interest rate environment. As higher interest rates caused the
market for initial public offerings to shut down for many startups and
made private fundraising more costly, some SVB clients started pulling
money out. To fund the redemptions, SVB sold on Wednesday a $21 billion
bond portfolio consisting mostly of U.S. Treasuries, and said it would
sell $2.25 billion in common equity and preferred convertible stock to
fill its funding hole. Its stock collapsed and depositors started to
panic. SVB scrambled this week to reassure its venture capital clients
their money was safe. By Friday, the collapsing stock price had made its
capital raise untenable and sources said the bank tried to look at other
options, including a sale, until regulators stepped in and shut the bank
down. After the FDIC announcement, employees received an email from the
company saying they would be contacted by officials about employment and
compensation, according to a source who declined be identified. As of
Friday evening, there had not been any further communication from the
company or the FDIC, the source said. The last FDIC-insured institution
to close was Almena State Bank in Kansas, on October 23, 2020.

How to unlearn.. after tasting massive wins?

Nextbigwhat.com

March 28, 2021 Sunday

Length: 550 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, March 28 -- Pretty much all the important roles in an
organization fall for confirmation bias, that is *I know-it-all* bias,
and 'this-is-how-it-works' bias.

For example, if you have had a very successful run with the launch of a
product, the chances are that you will be 100% confident that the next
product launch will be super hits (in fact much better than the previous
ones).

Why? Because you know how-it-works. How the system works. You know the
taste of the audience. You know how to do PR. You know how to create the
right noise.

Well, at least you think so.

By the way, remember Nokia? Blackberry? Ouch.... Let's move on.

How does one stay open to new ideas, then?

Practically speaking, most successful managers/leaders end up
surrounding themselves with yes-(wo)men and that just adds very
significantly to the *I-am-inevitable* syndrome.

How can one break free from this?

Where do you find them? Outside your comfort zone. Outside your office.
Outside your current network.

What does that mean? How do I figure this out?

Few things:

UnStage Yourself !

Learn to be in the audience (and not just the speaker).

What do I mean? After a point, most *accomplished* professionals stop
attending any event/meetup/workshops (online or offline) as an audience.

Either I am invited as a speaker. Or I am too busy to attend events.

If you are always the smartest person in the room (i.e. talking and
dispersing gyaan), you are definitely not learning. Some of the amazing
leaders I know are often attending random Clubhouse events to Zoom
webinars to learn and get more perspective from others.

Learn to be an audience. And a great one at it. The first step towards
being curious is to become a true learner.

Set yourself up for failure (outside work.. to start with) !

Of course, I won't recommend trying out this in your core job - but try
to set yourself up for failure outside your work.

For instance, start writing if you aren't doing so. It not only improves
your clarity and gets better at work (read: Why Product managers should
write). But if writing is not your thing, start a TikTok channel or a
podcast or whatever - that keeps you in front of an audience and opens
yourself to be judged (and laughed upon).

Congratulations on swallowing up all your ego and pride.

Mingle with Younger Colleagues

Seriously. All the great disruption is happening there.

Plus, culturally, one needs to be a lot more aware of the new new world,
and the only way to do is to become good friends with your younger
colleagues.

The new jargons/lingos to how they consume products/think of new tech -
all of that is a mini-crash course in itself!

Last, but not the least.

Up-skill yourself. Everyday. Find an app, a group, what'er works for
you - but have a dedicated time to unlearn.

For instance, if you believe that email marketing always works - start
leanirng messenger marketing or podcast marketing - a new skill will
change your entire perspective on how much is there to the world than
your own knowledge/skill (plug: this is one of the core reasons why I am
working on FWD app, but more on that later).

Happy Learning !

We have announced a new policy for the biotechnology sector, to
reinforce capacity building, infrastructure development, research
institutions for the emerging technology areas such as antimicrobial
resistance, Agribiotechnology, Bioinformatics among others, which are
expected to offer innovative solutions.

I am confident that the karnataka bio-technology policy 2017-2022 will
give a big boost to the various segments of the biotechnology sector.

- Sri K. Siddaramaiah Chief Minister of Karnataka

Karnataka, The Biotech Hub of Asia

Karnataka is home to one of the earliest and most thriving biotech
ecosystems in India. The biotech ecosystem in Karnataka comprises the
biotech industry, including a large array of biotechnology enterprises,
including large companies and mid- sized ones. Alongside the industry,
is an array of new, promising biotech startups.

The support for industry and startups comes from the strong biotech
research base in Karnataka, comprising of many nationally and
internationally renowned biotechnology research institutions.

Driving the future growth of the biotech sector in the State is a
proactive Government of Karnataka policy that was one of the first to
foresee the potential of biotechnology, and came out with a slew of
well-timed policies, offering incentives and concessions to
stakeholders. In 2016, Karnataka announced the Startup Policy.

The broad drivers for doing business for biotech enterprises in
Karnataka include a conducive biotech hub- home to major biotech
companies, good research infrastructure, and proactive Government
Policy, including incentives.

Startups

The startup ecosystem is marked by the creation, growth and eventual
success, or failure of new startups that aim to solve a specific problem
area. In Karnataka, entrepreneurs have started-up new biotech ventures,
aided by Government funding, and dipping into their personal funds.

Karnataka has a network of good early-stage incubators, including
Bangalore Bioinnovation Centre (BBC); Centre for Cellular And Molecular
Platforms (C-CAMP); Indian Institute of Science-Society for Innovation
and Development (IISc-SID); International Centre for Innovation,
Technology Transfer and Entrepreneurship (IN-CITE) Technology Business
Incubator (TBI); Central Food Technological Research Incubator (CFTRI);
and Agri Incubator Dharwad.

Karnataka Startup Policy 2016

The policy aims to create a world-class startup ecosystem in the state
through strategic investment and policy interventions leveraging the
robust innovation climate in Bangalore by

* Stimulating the growth of 20000 technology based startups including
6000 product startups by 2020 in Karnataka;

* Achieving creation of 6 lakh direct and 12 lakh indirect new
employments in the sector;

* Mobilizing Rs. 2000 Crore funding for investment in startups through
Government intervention alone, by leveraging the Fund of Funds proposed
to be put in place by the State Government.

Karnataka's Pie of the Biotech Market

The global market for Biotechnology in 2015 is estimated by ABLE-CMR to
be at US $335 Billion, growing annually at a compounded annual growth
rate (CAGR) of 11%. Beyond the global markets of EU, and US, the growth
in biotechnology sector is most prominent in Asia. With a biotech market
size of US$ 72 Billion, Asia is growing at a CAGR of 15%. Within Asia,
India is ranked second to China. With 17% of the world's population with
increasing disposable incomes, India is an attractive bet for
biotechnology industry.

The Indian Biotechnology Sector is showing strong growth potential, and
is expected to develop further as an innovative manufacturing hub. The
Indian biotech industry holds about 5% share of the global biotech
industry, and is valued at US$ 18.7 Billion with a CAGR of 25%. As the
hub of biotechnology in India, Karnataka is growing at an impressive 35%
CAGR, with a market size of US$ 6.5 Billion. The biotech industry in
Karnataka, comprising about 228 companies and about 65 biotech startups,
holds about 2% market share of the global biotech industry. The major
hubs for Biotechnology include Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubli - Dharwad,
Tumkur, and Mangalore, with new potential hubs under development, across
the State.

The biotech industry in Karnataka has a 9% market share in Asia, while
in India, it commands an impressive 35% market share. Karnataka is the
preferred destination for biopharma and bioservices industry,
especially, clinical trials, contract research and manufacturing
activities. Karnataka is also strong on bioagri, medical devices and
bioinformatics. Going forward, Karnataka will continue to develop its
lead, and increase its market share in Asia and globally. As one of the
earliest biotech ecosystems in India, Karnataka is able to attract new
biotech market entrants - including established firms as well as new
startup ventures. By co-locating in Karnataka, new market entrants able
to leverage the supply channels - research institutions, industry, human
capital, good infrastructure, and good regional and international
connectivity. Hence, it is no surprise that Karnataka is known as the
Biotech Hub of India.

Biotech Sector in Karnataka

Karnataka was the first Indian State to bring out a policy for the
Biotechnology industry in 2001. Subsequently, it also introduced the
Millennium Biotech Policy II, a revised policy, in 2009, to build upon
the achievements of the 2001 policy. This policy encouraged the
establishment of Biotechnology finishing schools across the State.

The Government of Karnataka is committed towards creating a supportive

Type of Companies

Expert's views about Karnataka's Achievements

Karnataka contributes up to 50% of India's biotechnology revenues

Biotech industry being a sunrise industry, with lot of potential of
creating employment and Intellectual Property Rights, was slightly
constrained in the past because of capital intensive nature of drug
discovery research and long gestation periods in bringing out products
to the market. Karnataka has been a trendsetter in bridging this gap by
supporting the industry by unique programs like PIC grants, Elevate 100
and creating handholding platforms which has resulted in most biotech
firms preferring their presence in Karnataka alone and Biotechnology
enterprises in Karnataka contributing up to 50% of India's revenues in
biotechnology. Factors contributing to this are its strong ecosystem and
rich tradition of education and biotechnology training. Undoubtedly,
government of Karnataka plays a pivotal role by promoting Finishing
schools, setting up a Vision group and above all, a R&D friendly Biotech
Policy rolled out in Sept 2017.

- Dr. Chaitra Harsha, MD, Vipragen Biosciences

Karnataka - a leader in adopting new technologies such as NextGen
sequencing, Genome editing

Karnataka has emerged as a model state in drafting and implementing
Biotech policies in India. The state is a hub of Biotechnology both in
R&D and manufacturing sector. To cater to ever growing demand for
skilled talent in this sector, Karnataka also has boosted the biotech
skill development and training programs equally. Karnataka is also a
leader in adopting new technologies such as NextGen sequencing, Genome
editing, cellular therapies and high end diagnostics and many more. This
is possible due to effective collaboration that is nurtured between
renowned research institutions and industries or start-ups. The new
initiatives by the Government to foster Biotech start-ups in tier 2 and
tier 3 cities of Karnataka is commendable. This has created a biotech
ecosystem in the state with world class incubation centres with
financial support system. The Government push for disruptive ideas such
as grand challenges and Elevate 100 has given further boost to biotech
start-ups.

India, March 12 -- Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar will meet this
week with Indian startups affected by the abrupt closure of troubled
Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) to understand the impact and offer government
assistance in overcoming the crisis. (ALSO READ: Silicon Valley Bank
collapse: What we know so far about failed US lender)

"The SVB Financial closure is certainly disrupting startups across the
world. Startups are an important part of the New India economy. I will
meet with Indian startups this week to understand the impact on them and
how Narendra Modi's government can help during this crisis," the Union
minister of state for skill development, entrepreneurship, and
electronics and information technology informed in a tweet.

Telling that the Indian financial sector is resilient under PM Modi and
taking a dig at Congress, minister Chandrasekhar continued, "The SVB
Financial collapse in US sharp contrast with India's stable and strong
financial sector, which PM Narendra Modi, has rebuilt from its crony NPA
ridden destructing during Congress lost decade to a strong, growing
catalyst of the New India Economy today."

How does SVB failure affect India's startups?

Silicon Valley Bank is the largest lender to some of the largest tech
companies in the world. This includes a number of Indian startups that
have been exposed to its investments and may now be stuck with the funds
raised.

SVB had exposure to at least 21 startups in India, according to recent
data from market intelligence platform Tracxn, though the amount
invested in these startups is unknown.

Gokul Rajaram, a board member at Pinterest and Coinbase, writes,
"India-based founders don't know who to turn to as an alternate to SVB.
Likely true for founders in other countries too."

"From what I hear, SVB was the only bank that would bank a Delaware C
Corp with founders who didn't have a SSN. Unique, tech-forward bank.
Shame what's happening," he wrote in a Twitter post.

Silicon Valley Bank collapse

California regulators shut down the US lender and placed it in
receivership, sending shockwaves throughout the global financial market.
This occurred following SVB's failed share sale attempt, and startups
began withdrawing funds at the urging of venture capital firms. The
failure is being described as the largest financial institution failure
since the 2008 Washington Mutual collapse at the height of the financial
crisis.

The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is beginning to
spread around the world this Sunday, March 12.

Startup founders in California's Bay Area are panicking over access to
money and employee pay. Fears of contagion have reached Canada, India
and China. In the U.K., the Silicon Valley unit will become insolvent,
has already ceased trading and is no longer accepting new clients. On
Saturday, the leaders of some 180 technology companies sent a letter
calling for the intervention of UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.

"The loss of deposits has the potential to cripple the sector and set
the ecosystem back 20 years," they said in the letter seen by Bloomberg.
"Many companies will be sent into involuntary liquidation overnight."

This is just the beginning. Silicon Valley also had branches in China,
Denmark, Germany, India, Israel and Sweden. The founders warn that the
bank's failure could wipe out start-ups around the world without
government intervention. The bank's joint venture in China, SPD Silicon
Valley Bank Co, sought to calm local customers by reminding them that
operations have been independent and stable.

"This crisis will begin on Monday, so please avoid it now," the founders
and CEOs of U.K. startups said in the letter to Hunt. The companies
listed in the letter include Uncapped, Apian, Pockit and Pivotal Earth.

Hunt spoke to the governor of the Bank of England about the situation on
Saturday morning, and the economic secretary to the Treasury held a
roundtable discussion with the affected companies later that day, the
Treasury said.

Underscoring the challenge governments face in managing the full extent
of the fallout: the U.K. Treasury has begun probing startups, asking how
much they have on deposit, their approximate cash consumption and their
access to banking facilities in Silicon Valley and beyond, two people
familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the
information is not public. Treasury declined to comment on the survey.

The founders were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the roundtable and
any information on how their deposits would be handled at the bank. Toby
Mather, CEO of U.K.-based educational software startup Lingumi, has 85
percent of his company's cash in Silicon Valley. He tried to transfer
some of his accounts, but as of Saturday night, he wasn't sure if that
worked. "This is life or death for us," he said. "These things seemed so
mundane before."

Jack O'Meara, founder of London genomics startup Ocher Bio, spent the
weekend trying, unsuccessfully, to get the deposits out of Silicon
Valley. "If there's no intervention," he said, "it could really wipe out
a generation of entrepreneurial companies."

As in the U.S., some Silicon Valley deposits in the U.K. are insured,
but it was unclear when those funds would be available. A deeper concern
among startup leaders is that the collapse of the bank would reduce
future venture capital funding in the U.K., where companies are already
hampered by Brexit .

Asia's tech leaders are also scrambling to assess the potential
ramifications. In Singapore, financiers and entrepreneurs at a Wharton
alumni gathering in Shangri-La shared news of the fallout, while startup
founders and investors at a conference in Mumbai spoke of nothing else.

"The impact of the Silicon Valley incident on the technology industry
should not be underestimated," analysts led by Liu Zhengning of China
International Capital Corp. said in a note. Deposits are crucial for
tech startups because they generally require a large amount of cash to
pay for considerable expenses, including research and development costs
and staff salaries, they said.

"If these cash deposits ultimately have to be affected in the bankruptcy
or restructuring process, some technology companies may face high cash
flow stress," they said. "Bankruptcy risks should not be excluded."

Back in Silicon Valley, U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna of Santa Clara held a
town hall Friday night attended by more than 600 people, including
startup founders, tech leaders and bank employees. It ran for more than
2.5 hours with the primary focus on small businesses trying to make
payroll across the country on Monday.

SVB customers in California, many of them startup founders, stood
outside the bank's branch on Silicon Valley's famed Sand Hill Road in
the cold and rain on Friday, March 10, knocking on closed glass doors
and trying to get Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation representatives
to answer their questions.

The founder of a drone startup said a withdrawal she made Thursday
hadn't gone through and she was worried about making payroll for her 12
full-time employees. She had tried calling the FDIC several times, "but
the number doesn't answer," she said.

Another customer commented that he should have brought a bottle of
whiskey to pass around while they waited. When trying to get more
information from an FDIC representative, he said, "Put yourself in our
shoes." The representative apologized before closing the glass door once
again.

Some in the VC and startup world are trying to find temporary solutions.
Uncapped, a U.K. financial technology startup that lends to other
startups, said it is launching an emergency funding program to help
companies meet payroll and other obligations, as well as longer-term
bridge loans to help with working capital.

In Canada, Silicon Valley Financial Group's Canadian unit reported C$435
($314 million) in secured loans last year, double the previous year's
C$212 million, regulatory documents show. Its clients include e-commerce
software provider Shopify and pharmaceutical company HLS Therapeutics,
according to an earlier statement from the bank.

Toronto-based ad tech firm AcuityAds Holdings disclosed Saturday that it
had $55 million in deposits in Silicon Valley, representing more than 90
percent of its cash. The firm halted trading in its shares on Friday
after a 14 percent drop, citing the "developing situation" with Silicon
Valley Bank.

Philippines : Nancy urges NEDA-PSA to monitor success, failure rate of
gov't livelihood programs

Senator Nancy Binay urged the National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA) and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) to create
a consolidated database to monitor success rates of livelihood programs
financed by the government.

"Livelihood programs provided to individuals, cooperatives, and
organizations should be monitored by the donating agency," Binay said.

"It's not just about giving. Every agency must have a study. It must be
rationalized and have a significant impact on the beneficiary, and it is
also important to know what the economic returns of these programs are,"
she added.

The senator expressed her concern after a recent virtual briefing of the
Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) on the proposed 2021
National Expenditure Program revealed the absence of available data on
the results of government livelihood programs.

"Maybe in the next budget we can provide funds to conduct a study for
these types of programs since we have been spending a lot for these,"
Binay said.

According to Binay, if a certain agency aims to provide P20,000 cash
assistance to those who want to start a business or livelihood, there
should be a mechanism where it can monitor, assess, and report its
success, and follow up the progress or failure of the intended startup.

"We want to know why P20k will be given to startups to someone who wants
to do business? Why not 50k or P100k? What is the basis of P20k and what
businesses can start with such an investment?" Binay said.

"Once given, does the agency monitor the recipient's life progress? Did
he really build a business? What happened to the family he helped?" she
pointed out.

Binay said the lack of data on the success rate of government programs
is alarming considering the billions to trillions of pesos the
government had already invested in past programs for the past decades.

"We lack research, planning and monitoring. Imagine the trillions of
livelihood programs released by the government in recent decades for
poverty alleviation but there seems to be no progress if we base the
objectives of aid," he said. Binay said.

"Such data is important because we need to know if it is worthwhile for
us to fund such programs," she added.

The senator had earlier questioned the Overseas Workers Welfare
Administration (OWWA) on how the agency is monitoring its repatriation
grant to displaced OFWs amounting to P20,000.

During a Senate hearing, OWWA chief Hans Leo Cacdac admitted that while
there are success stories from OFWs using the aid, the agency does not
have "full-fledged" data on the matter.

In a bid to accelerate poverty reduction and promote growth in areas
where poverty incidences are high, government agencies are given
allocations to embark on a concerted effort to ensure that the factors
limiting the poor's participation in the economy growth are addressed.

Most of the government agencies (like DOLE, DSWD, DA, DILG, DND-OPPAP,
TESDA, DTI, DepEd, DOST, etc.) have allocations for poverty alleviation
programs, but fail to monitor the success or failure rates of their
programs and their beneficiaries.

Recycling Lives inspired by personal experience of homelessness; Steve
Jackson says the time is ripe for his more commercial version of a
social enterprise

Highlight: Steve Jackson says the time is ripe for his more commercial
version of a social enterprise

Body

If it wasn't for Covid-19, Steve Jackson would have been in Monaco this
week representing Britain at an annual international entrepreneurship
contest.

The normally glitzy competition, run by EY, the professional services
firm, was instead held virtually last night, but the prospect of
swapping a night on the tiles for a glorified Zoom call doesn't phase
the founder of Recycling Lives; after all, his family's background is in
scrap metal.

Among the 46 finalists from 41 countries in the competition, the
Lancastrian is more enterprising altruist than rapacious tycoon: since
2008, his metal recycling and waste management business has provided
work for hundreds of ex-prisoners, found permanent accommodation for
scores of homeless people and delivered millions of meals to those in
food poverty.

Not bad for a project that began when the former internet entrepreneur
realised retirement wasn't for him. "I did give retirement a try. I took
my secateurs to a big bush in the garden. By week six all that was left
was a stump. I thought, that's it, I'm going to get back involved."

While volunteering for a homeless charity, he wondered if business could
play a bigger role in helping people off the street. He started
Recycling Lives by buying half his family's scrap yard firm. "Copper,
lead, brass are all commodities. People aren't commodities. I thought I
could give them a training programme at the end of which would be
skilled employment, accommodation, a bank account, they'd be established
in society."

Prisoner rehabilitation was added because many of the homeless people it
helped had a criminal background. Last year, Recycling Lives had 12
recycling and fabrication workshops in prisons, employing 250 people at
a time.

It reckons it saved the taxpayer £7.4 million in 2018-19 because
reoffending rates for participating prisoners drop to less than 5 per
cent, compared with a national reoffending rate of about 35 per cent for
adults released from custody or starting court orders.

While working in prison, a proportion of their wages goes to a fund that
compensates victims of crime. When they are released, they can live in a
halfway house while they work at Recycling Lives, which now has annual
sales of about £170 million.

About 40 per cent of its staff are ex-prisoners, and the scheme also
places former offenders with jobs at large companies including United
Utilities, which removed its block on hiring people with a criminal
record to work with the project.

Between 2016 and 2019, Recycling Lives helped 228 men and women out of
prison and into jobs. "The majority were prolific offenders, with some
significant crimes and in the cycle of repeat offending. Once they know
there is support for them they can change their lives. To my knowledge,
it's the most successful rehabilitation programme in the history of the
prison service," Mr Jackson says.

The programme is active in roughly 10 per cent of prisons, and Mr
Jackson hopes that he can expand it, admitting there are some
frustrations that it hasn't been adopted more quickly across the
country.

Recycling Lives, which employs 500 people on ten sites, also provides
more than a million meals a year for families suffering the effects of
food poverty via a partnership with Fareshare, a charity. This year's
figure is likely to be higher as demand has soared during the pandemic.

Mr Jackson's business career began in the mid 1990s developing internet
start-ups, but an initial failure left him homeless. "I had a good idea
but I was very early and so I was quickly on my backside. I ended up
being homeless myself and sofa surfing, so I knew what it was like to be
on a high one moment and down in the dumps the next."

He eventually found success in trading domain names and did a deal with
Yahoo in which he earned 73p in every pound generated by online
advertising from his domain name portfolio. "I started 1999 as a pauper
and ended it a wealthy guy." He was chief executive of Preston North End
FC between 2004 and 2006, the club reaching the Premier League play-offs
twice.

Unlike a traditional social enterprise, which is a single corporate
entity with socially useful goals at its heart, Recycling Lives
separates the two; operating a business that supports the charity by
buying services from it. Mr Jackson, who was awarded an OBE in 2013,
says it means the business can be more commercial, and add contracts to
the ones it has with the likes of British Gas and BT as well as the
public sector, while the charity is freed from worries about fundraising
and its own sustainability.

"The businesses you win contracts from have confidence they're not
dealing with another social enterprise, because there's a bit of a
stigma attached to them of, oh crikey are they a woolly organisation
that's going to expect the world without delivering. If I have one
dream, it's that the model will be copied by others," he says. "You've
got lots of businesses out there that have been very focused on profit,
but are now thinking post Covid-19, that the penny really must drop, and
that we really must see social value and purpose on a par with profit.

He says Recycling Lives could offer a useful blueprint for others. "If
you follow our model and apply it to your business, you win the hearts
and minds of your clients," he says.

The competition was won by Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, from India. She founded
Biocon in 1978 with $500 and has turned it into one of Asia's leading
biotech companies, producing statins and immunosuppressants and
developing treatments for diabetes.

SVB fallout spreads around world from London to Singapore

Byline: , SVB fallout spreads around world from London to Singapore

Body

The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SBV) is beginning
to spread around the world.

Startup founders in California's Bay Area are panicking about access to
money and paying employees. Fears of contagion have reached Canada,
India and China. In the UK, SVB's unit is set to be declared insolvent,
has already ceased trading and is no longer taking new customers. On
Saturday (Mar 11), the leaders of roughly 180 tech companies sent a
letter calling on UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to intervene.

"The loss of deposits has the potential to cripple the sector and set
the ecosystem back 20 years," they said in the letter seen by Bloomberg.
"Many businesses will be sent into involuntary liquidation overnight."

This is just the beginning. SVB had branches in China, Denmark, Germany,
India, Israel and Sweden, too. Founders are warning that the bank's
failure could wipe out startups around the world without government
intervention. SVB's joint venture in China, SPD Silicon Valley Bank Co,
was seeking to calm local clients overnight by reminding them that
operations have been independent and stable.

"This crisis will start on Monday, and so we call on you to prevent it
now," UK startup founders and chief executive officers said in the
letter to Hunt. The companies listed in the letter include Uncapped,
Apian, Pockit and Pivotal Earth.

Hunt spoke with the governor of the Bank of England about the situation
on Saturday morning, and the economic secretary to the Treasury was
holding a roundtable with affected firms later in the day, the Treasury
said.

Underscoring the challenge governments face in getting a handle of the
full extent of the fallout: The UK Treasury has begun canvassing
startups, asking how much they have on deposit, their approximate cash
burn and their access to banking facilities at SVB and beyond, two
people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified
because the information is not public. The Treasury declined to comment
on the survey.

Founders were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the roundtable and any
information about how their deposits at the bank would be handled.

Toby Mather, CEO of UK-based education software startup Lingumi, has 85
per cent of his company's cash in SVB. He tried to transfer some of his
accounts, but as of Saturday evening, he was not sure whether that
worked. "This is life or death for us," he said. "These things seemed so
mundane before."

Jack O'Meara, founder of the London genomics startup Ochre Bio, spent
the weekend trying, unsuccessfully, to move deposits out of SVB. "If
there is no intervention," he said, "it could really wipe out a
generation of entrepreneurial companies."

As in the US, some SVB deposits in the UK are insured, but it was
unclear when those funds would be available. A deeper concern among
startup leaders is that the SVB collapse would throttle future funding
from venture capital (VC) into the UK, where businesses are already
hobbled by Brexit.

Asia's tech leaders are scrambling to assess the potential
ramifications, too. In Singapore, financiers and entrepreneurs at a
Wharton alumni gathering in the the Shangri-La shared news about the
fallout, while startup founders and investors at a conference in Mumbai
talked about nothing else.

"The impact of the SVB incident on the technology industry should not be
underestimated," analysts led by Liu Zhengning at China International
Capital Corp said in a note. Deposits are crucial for tech startups,
because they generally require a lot of cash to pay for hefty
expenditures, including research and development costs and staff
salaries, they said.

"If these cash deposits finally have to be impaired in the process of
bankruptcy or restructuring, some tech firms may face high cash flow
tension," they said.

"The risks of bankruptcy should not be excluded."

South Korea will closely watch for signs of impact on its financial
markets and economy from the collapse of SVB, the nation's finance
ministry said on Sunday after a meeting of senior officials.

The possibility of higher volatility and uncertainties cannot be ruled
out, though most officials at the gathering agreed it would not develop
into a systemic risk, according to a statement from the finance
ministry. The situation calls for round-the-clock monitoring and prompt
response, it said.

Back in Silicon Valley, US Congressman Ro Khanna from Santa Clara held a
town hall late Friday that was attended by more than 600 people
including startup founders, tech leaders and SVB employees. It went on
for more than 2.5 hours, with the primary focus on small businesses
trying to make payroll across the nation come Monday.

SVB customers in California, many of them startup founders, stood
outside of the bank's branch on Silicon Valley's famed Sand Hill Road in
the cold and rain on Friday, knocking on the locked glass doors and
trying to get representatives of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) to answer their questions.

A drones startup founder there said a withdrawal she made on Thursday
had not gone through, and that she was concerned about making payroll
for her 12 full-time employees. She had tried calling the FDIC multiple
times, "but the number doesn't answer", she said.

Another customer remarked that he should have brought a bottle of
whiskey to pass around as they waited. In trying to get more information
from an FDIC representative, he said: "Put yourself in our shoes." The
representative apologised before closing the glass door once again.

Some in the VC and startup world are trying to come up with temporary
fixes. Uncapped, a UK financial tech startup that lends to other
startups, said it was launching an emergency funding program to help
companies meet payroll and other obligations, as well as longer-term
bridge loans to help with working capital.

Alexander Fitzgerald, founder of broadband startup Cuckoo and a former
Treasury official, noted that the finances of British startups were
already stretched due to a slowdown in the VC funding market. "British
startups need the Treasury to step in fast," he said.

In Canada, SVB Financial Group's unit in the country reported C$435
million (S$424 million) in secured loans last year, double the C$212
million a year earlier, regulatory filings showed. Its customers include
e-commerce software provider Shopify and pharmaceutical company HLS
Therapeutics, according to a previous statement by the bank.

Toronto-based advertising-tech firm AcuityAds Holdings revealed on
Saturday it had US$55 million in deposits at SVB, amounting to more than
90 per cent of its cash. The firm had halted trading of its stock Friday
after a 14 per cent slump, citing the "unfolding situation" with SVB.

What Startups Need to Take Stock of During their Scale-up Phase

CIOL

September 29, 2022 Thursday 6:30 AM EST

"Think big, start small, then scale or fail fast" says a famous quote.
This saying is more or less the mantra for startups in today's day and
age. Once a startup is established, the next step for a new-age business
is naturally to look for avenues to scale. However, the actual scale-up
process and the journey towards becoming a unicorn and maintaining the
unicorn status is far from dreamy.

An IBM-sponsored study called Entrepreneurial India released in 2017
says a different story. According to the survey, as many as 90 percent
of Indian startups fail within the first five years of their inception.
In addition to that, nearly 77 percent of the venture capitalists
believed that lack of innovation was the primary reason for the failure
of startups. While considering these stats, what are some of the factors
that startups need to keep in mind before expanding their business?
Let's find out!

Important Things Startups Must Keep in Mind While Scaling

Check if business is scalable: The primary question that startups need
to ask themselves is if their business is ready to scale. The important
factors that need to be considered here are customer lifetime value
(CLTV), which is basically the average revenue a single customer is
predicted to generate over the duration of their account and customer
acquisition cost (CAC) - the average expense of gaining a single
customer. If a startup is for some unsure of this, scaling up would
basically be an unsuccessful exercise.

Innovation: Constant innovation is a key to any successful business. In
order to sustain, businesses must be open to improving and evolving.
Several businesses have lost their unicorn status as they were not able
to offer anything new. In fact, figures released by the Geneva-based
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) had stated that In 2014,
India filed 1,428 international patent applications as against 42,381 by
Japan, 25,548 by China and 13,117 by South Korea. However, the Indian
Government claims that the positive initiatives announced by them has
addressed this issue. Some of the key initiatives taken by the
government over the years that has bolstered India's IP regime includes
fee concessions like 10% rebate on online filing, 80% fee concession for
startups, small entities and educational institutions, and provisions on
expedited examination for startups and MSMEs along with other
categories. Due to these initiatives, filing of patents have increased
from 42,763 in 2014-15 to 66,440 in 2021-22, which is an increase of
more than 50% in a span of 7 years.

Hiring the right people: An idea is only as good as its execution. And
execution completely boils down to the team that has undertaken the
task. Having the right people taking care of their responsibilities
along with the appropriate culture fit supporting the organisation will
certainly help take the startup to greater heights. Furthermore, hiring
should be done at an appropriate speed. Hiring employees too soon may
impact the culture of a company in a detrimental and uncontrollable way.

Customer feedback is supreme: While startups benefit from a happy
customer, they would benefit more from an unhappy customer as well. Like
the popular saying goes, "customer is king" and learning lessons from
the feedback given by customers will help businesses go a long way.
Along with the product the company is offering, superior customer
service and experience must be given utmost importance. Acquiring new
customers, while retaining old ones should be a priority as well.

Mind the cashflow: A study has found that most startups fail because
they end up exhausting their funds before they turn profitable.
Therefore, funding and being supported by the right set of investors
while a startup scales is extremely important. There should be a strong
cashflow, and businesses must be mindful of the cashburn.

Remember the intent with which the company was started: Several
companies often tend to forget the intent and passion with which they
started their venture once they become profitable. Staying true to one's
DNA and working on the strengths of the company should be a consistent
and ongoing process. Companies should always make an effort of
maintaining the standards that made them successful.

I built a $4Bn company: Here are 12 mindsets that helped me

Nextbigwhat.com

September 20, 2021 Monday

Copyright 2021 Pi All Rights Reserved

Length: 668 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, Sept. 20 -- Over the last 5 years, I built a $4B company. Sounds
awesome right? Not until recently. I made every mistake imaginable. The
toughest part was getting my head right. Here are the 12 mindset rules
that I've developed.

Rule 1: Get Started If you tell 10 people about your idea, it'll go
something like this: - 5 will say it won't work - 3 will say you're
crazy - 2 will be indifferent The best part? None of these people's
opinions matter. Just get started. It'll be the hardest thing you do.

Rule 2: Never Stop The leading cause of startup failure is founders
giving up. If you don't give up, you can't fail. Easier said than done,
I know. Some days you'll feel on top of the world, some days you'll feel
like everything is breaking. Whatever it is, never give up.

Rule 3: Hire Uncomfortably Good People I started Bolt as a 19 year old
college dropout. On paper, I was nothing. Most people think they should
hire people they can one up. I did the opposite: I hired people WAY out
of my league. It was a forcing function to mature fast.

Rule 4: Get Your Sh*t Together It took me A LOT of inner work to get
this one. Early on, I was operating from a place of insecurity and fear.
Productive in the short term, destructive in the long term. Preparation
builds confidence. Do the work and trust your instincts.

Rule 5: Be OK with Failure I've studied 100s of successful startups.
Lots of differences between the lot, but one commonality: they all have
risk-seeking cultures. To get 10x outcomes, you have to take 10x risks.
If you fail, do it fast, and move on.

Rule 6: Don't Be OK with Too Much Failure Embracing failure is important
but don't fall in love with it. This is one of Bezos' iconic leadership
lessons from Amazon: "Be right, a lot." People who are right = people
who listen + people who change their mind.

Rule 7: Eat Healthy, Stay Balanced This is so underrated. Your company
is a reflection of you. If you are unhealthy and imbalanced, your
company will be too. I used to think I was invincible. As I (and
everyone) eventually learned, nobody is. Take care of yourself.

Rule 8: Sometimes Get Unhealthy and Unbalanced Wait what? You just told
me to do the opposite! We have a concept at Bolt called a "Lightning
Week". You should go into the red for short stints - this gets maximum
intensity. Don't be afraid to step on the gas.

Rule 9: Creativity is a Pillar of Execution Early on, I put a premium on
logical thinking. While important, too much logic = too much rational
thinking. To build something great you need to think outside the box.
You need creativity.

Rule 10: Don't Let People Get Too Creative Creativity pushes you to
think outside the box. But here's the thing - a lot of building a
company is blocking and tackling. Boring is good - it creates
predictability and durability. Be creative in planning; boring in
execution.

Rule 11: Take It Seriously Conviction is cascading. Nobody is going to
care more than you as the Founder. And honestly, you can't expect them
to. But everyone can have the same level of conviction. Aspire for that.
Show your team you're serious by making every day count.

Rule 12: But Don't Take It Too Seriously If you're not having fun along
the way, you're going to break. Not a question of if, more like when.
I've made some of my best friends by working on Bolt over the last 5
years. At the end of the day, that's what really matters.

And that's it! Startups are tough - wherever you are in your journey, I
salute you. I hope these 12 mindset rules help as you as much as they've
helped me. I still reflect on all 12 of these every day.

If you enjoyed this thread give me a follow @ryantakesoff. I'm starting
to tweet more and will be tweeting about lessons learned fundraising,
building and operating a $4B+ business. Let's take off together!

April 06 -- The Government with an intent to build a strong ecosystem
for nurturing innovation, startups and encouraging private investments
in startup ecosystem of the country launched Startup India initiative on
16th January 2016.

As per eligibility conditions prescribed under G.S.R. notification 127
(E) dated 19th February 2019, entities are recognised as 'startups'
under Startup India initiative by the Department for Promotion of
Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Since the launch of Startup India
initiative in 2016, DPIIT has recognised 92,683 entities as startups as
on 28th February 2023.

The number of startups recognised in the country in the last five years
is as under:

 

Number of entities recognised as startups by
DPIIT201820192020202120228,63511,27914,49820,04626,542 

The regular businesses are often measured by success or failure in a
specific number of years of operation, whereas, the startups and
scale-ups (established startups) are more accurately measured by failure
or success in a particular phase making it difficult to put together a
statistic covering all types of new businesses and their failure rate
with any level of accuracy. Therefore, the information with respect to
the success or failure of startups is not centrally maintained by the
Government.      

Startup India initiative was launched on 16th January 2016 with an
objective to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and
startups in the country that would drive sustainable economic growth and
generate large scale employment opportunities. The details of various
programs undertaken by the Government to promote startups across the
country under Startup India initiative are given below.

Programs Implemented under Startup India initiative

on 16th January 2016. The Action Plan comprises of 19 action items
spanning across areas such as "Simplification and handholding", "Funding
support and incentives" and "Industry-academia partnership and
incubation". The Action Plan laid the foundation of Government support,
schemes and incentives envisaged to create a vibrant startup ecosystem
in the country.

Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) Scheme: The Government has established
FFS with corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore, to meet the funding needs of
startups. DPIIT is the monitoring agency and Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) is the operating agency for FFS. The
total corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore is envisaged to be provided over the
14th and 15th Finance Commission cycles based on progress of the scheme
and availability of funds. It has not only made capital available for
startups at early stage, seed stage and growth stage but also played a
catalytic role in terms of facilitating raising of domestic capital,
reducing dependence on foreign capital and encouraging home grown and
new venture capital funds.

Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS): The Government has
established the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups for providing
credit guarantees to loans extended to DPIIT recognized startups by
Scheduled Commercial Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and

  ------------------------------------------------ -------- -------- -------- --------

the success or failure of startups is not centrally maintained by the
Government.

The following information was released by the Government of India:

by PIB Delhi

The Government with an intent to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing
innovation, startups and encouraging private investments in startup

January 2016.

(E) dated 19th February 2019, entities are recognised as startups under

Internal Trade (DPIIT). Since the launch of Startup India initiative in
2016, DPIIT has recognised 92,683 entities as startups as on 28th
February 2023.

The regular businesses are often measured by success or failure in a
specific number of years of operation, whereas, the startups and
scale-ups (established startups) are more accurately measured by failure
or success in a particular phase making it difficult to put together a
statistic covering all types of new businesses and their failure rate
with any level of accuracy. Therefore, the information with respect to
the success or failure of startups is not centrally maintained by the
Government.

Startup India initiative was launched on 16th January 2016 with an
objective to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and
startups in the country that would drive sustainable economic growth and

[Startup Bharat] With clients like Flipkart and Instamojo,
Ahmedabad-based LegalWiz.in is making starting up easier

India is home to the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world, after
the US and China. Having said that, about 90 percent of startups fail to
perform. According to a study by Forbes, the lack of innovation is the
major cause of failure of these startups.

Not only entrepreneurs have to be innovative but also comply with
several registrations, tax, and labour laws. Thus, it becomes extremely
tiring and difficult for startup founders to focus on growth and
innovation while ensuring 100 percent compliance.

Enter Ahmedabad-headquartered LegalWiz.in. Founded on April 02, 2015,
LegalWiz.in focusses on making legal compliance simple, affordable, and
transparent for early-stage startups and small businesses.

"Businesses should be doing what they are good at and leave the
back-office and compliance work to us," Co-founder Shrijay Sheth says.

Realising dreams

Born to a family of entrepreneurs, Shrijay always dreamt of building his
own business. But, he chose to get his degree first and gain substantial
experience before starting up. He did his post-graduate diploma in
Investment and Financial Analysis from the Gujarat University and later
did his MBA in Corporate Finance from the San Diego State University,
California.

Post his MBA studies, Shrijay worked with a legaltech company -
LegalZoom, as the Financial and Business Analytics Consultant for five
years. After returning home, Shrijay founded Hire4Higher Consulting, a
boutique analytics and strategy consulting firm.

"I went through the process of registering my business and realised that
many first-generation entrepreneurs in India lack quality service
providers within their immediate network," he says.

Meanwhile, he met Namann Pipara, who ran his conventional CA firm,
Pipara & Company, at a business networking event in 2014. "It struck us
immediately; with my background in legal ecommerce and his expertise as
a CA, we could create a strong base for offering better services. That
is how we created a comprehensive business professional solution,"
Shrijay says.

Thus, the duo started LegalWiz in 2015.

At present, the team is 30-plus employees strong, including in-house
professionals such as chartered accountants, company secretaries,
lawyers, marketing experts, web developers, and designers. Besides, the
company also has 50-plus affiliates.

"Ahmedabad attracts professionals from major neighbouring cities of
Gujarat and Rajasthan, making it easier for us to find candidates,"
Shrijay adds.

Services offered

LegalWiz.in offers services that include business registration for
startups and SMEs, obtaining tax and government registrations, and
ensuring regular filings.

The startup also has specialists who advise on intellectual property
rights that enable businesses to secure trademarks, copyrights, and
patents.

Further, it offers customised legal document drafting, online
book-keeping, and fulfiling yearly compliance needs for LLPs and Private
Limited Companies. Recently, LegalWiz.in has added other services which
include ISO certification for quality assurance and FSSAI registration
for the foodtech companies.

Shrijay says the startup doesn't charge any hidden costs. For a Private
Limited Company's registration, it charges Rs 6,000. Further, it charges
an annual compliance fee of Rs 4,599, GST return filing fees of Rs 799
monthly, copyright registration fees of Rs 4,699, and more. These costs
include professional fees, GST, and other government charges.

Most of these services have different packages to select from.

How does it work

LegalWiz.in's marketing and content teams are primarily tasked to
generate leads through various online and offline channels. These teams
also create content relevant to day-to-day challenges faced by
businesses, related to legal and compliance matters.

Within the operations team, the startup has a dedicated client-facing
department where professionals (also known as 'advisors on-call') advise
current, as well as prospective clients for free-of-cost.

Further, the operations team, along with a nationwide network of
professional firms, execute client tasks. The team members are assigned
particular clients that they have to work with, are responsible for
keeping the clients updated with the process, and regularly communicate
with them.

"Our greatest value addition is a dedicated account manager to each
service order, who would ensure standard quality of delivery throughout
the entire process," Shrijay says.

A number game

According to Shrijay, to date, LegalWiz.in has over 5,000 paying clients
and over 30,000 MSME registrations on its website. LegalWiz.in's client
list includes startups like eChai and CricHeros. It's larger clients
include Flipkart, Bank of Baroda, Vyapaar Samachar, and Instamojo.

Since its inception, the startup has doubled its annual growth. In 2018,
LegalWiz.in recorded a 20 percent growth each quarter. Currently, the
startup is bootstrapped.

Shrijay says, at present, the company is profitable.

"Our cash burn is restricted to marketing and new technology build-out.
We have a high percentage of customer satisfaction, thus, our
word-of-mouth branding is strong. It helps us to lower our acquisition
costs and enables us to pass on the advantage of reduced operational
costs to our clients," he adds.

Recently, LegalWiz.in was invited by Startup India to provide feedback
on improving processes for starting up and managing businesses in the
country.

Market overview and future plans

The legaltech market is huge and holds space for multiple players.
LegalWiz.in competes with the likes of Business Setup, Vakilsearch,
Indiafillings, LawRato, and Cleartax. However, Shrijay says that the
startup's USP is its team of professionals.

"Our team strives to provide the highest quality services and answer
customer queries personally, unlike others, who have sales-driven call
centres as an extended service. The CS, CAs, and lawyers address the
customer queries, and provide help to even those who are not our
customers yet," Shrijay says.

Further, LegalWiz.in plans to introduce tech-based products that can be
sold in a SaaS model. "It will open new dimensions of the revenue stream
for the company in the coming months," he says.

As it becomes more inclusive as a business model and targets to
hyper-grow as a full-service and software provider, LegalWiz.in will be
looking for funding options soon.

YourStory UNCUT: Brijraj Bhuptani's bumpy ride to solving for mobility

YourStory UNCUT aims to explore the biggest challenges and failures
startups and entrepreneurs have faced in their journeys. This week,
Brijraj Bhuptani of Spry talks about his roadblocks on the path to
solving for mobility.

Being a startup founder is never a cakewalk. But does the road get a
little smoother for a second-time entrepreneur? This week on YourStory
UNCUT, seasoned entrepreneur Brijraj Bhuptani answers this question.
YourStory UNCUT is a series of interviews where entrepreneurs reveal the
biggest challenges and failures they have faced in their journey so far.
Former Chief Product and Technology Officer at Ola, Brijraj shares his
entrepreneurial journey so far from founding Ridlr, to working at Ola,
and then starting up Spry, which he runs currently. "> ">

Being a first-time entrepreneur

An electrical engineer from the University of Missouri, Brijraj worked
with Qualcomm, Nextwave Wireless, and Sears India before he decided to
take the entrepreneurial route. In April 2012, he co-founded Ridlr and
Traffline, under parent company Birds Eye Systems, along with Ravi
Khemani.

The Traffline app provided live traffic information for daily commuters.
Ridlr, on the other hand, was an end-to-end ticketing and commuting app
for public transportation. However, "Birds Eye Systems was initially
running like a lab," Brijraj tells YourStory.

While the team was focused on building "cool products", they had no
definitive plan or business and revenue models in place. As a result,
they did not manage to get great user traction.

This, says the entrepreneur, was his biggest failure. In fact, the
Traffline app had to be shut down. "I did not know how to scale the
company, return to the investors or pay my employees. At one point, we
were nine days from shutting down," he adds, "We even had to turn off
the air conditioner in the office," recalls Brijraj.

The defining moment for Ridlr was raising the first round of funding
towards the end of 2015. Brijraj turned around the business and decided
that irrespective of how big or small his business becomes, Ridlr would
"Never work in this manner ever again," he adds. Post this, Birds Eye
Systems changed 90 percent of the team to accommodate the new strategy.

A year and a half later, the startup got four term sheets from the likes
of Amazon, Google, Ola, and Mobikwik. And in 2018, Ridlr was acquired by
Ola Cabs, and Brijraj and his team of 64 people joined the ride-sharing
unicorn.

But that was not the end of roadblocks for Brijraj and Ridlr.

The startup pivoted to a B2B model and partnered with government
agencies, going against the wishes of many. Eight months later, Ridlr
had no traction at all.

"For me to stand in front of investors and stakeholders and assure them
to have patience, and holding the company together was very difficultBut
eight months later, we changed the face of ticketing," says Brijraj.

Bouncing back from zero

With the pandemic bringing mobility and transportation to a standstill,
the growth graphs at both Ridlr and Ola took a detour and came soaring
down.

"It was extremely depressing," Brijraj recalls, "Mobility and helping
people move was the only thing I knew and the world took that away from
me."

Soon, Ola cars were back in their garages, and driver executives were
asked to not come to work. However, once things started looking better
and Ola got its first 200 ride requests. "It felt like two million
rides," he exclaims.

On the flip side, these pandemic-led challenges resulted in the launch
of Spry.

Mission: Mobility for all

After three years at Ola, in May last year, Brijraj joined hands with
his former colleague Riyaz Rehman (former Chief Business Officer at
Ridlr) to build Spry - a startup aimed at democratising accessibility
and affordability of movement health through its digital platform.

"As an entrepreneur, I strongly believe in mobility. Ridlr was also
about helping people get from one point to another. Similarly, at Spry,
I am empowering people to have the freedom to moveeveryone is entitled
to lead a pain-free life," says Brijraj.

Delaware-based Spry works as a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platform,
enabling physical rehabilitation practitioners and business owners to
manage their administrative and clinical functions using just one tool.
In less than a year, the startup has acquired over 100 clinics as
clients in India, and another seven in the US.

This time, Brijraj says he has been mindful of having a concrete
business and revenue model in place, which was missing in his previous
venture.

The startup has both B2B and B2C revenue streams and earns on each
transaction as well as in subscription form.

Looking back at the hurdles today, Brijraj believes that hard work is
not always the way out of challenging times. "During childhood, we are
taught that 'mehnat karo, kuch na kuch ho jayega' (work hard and you
will figure something out), but that is not always the case," he says,
adding that there should be deep introspection about what one does, and
how they do it.

Brijraj believes that there are multiple ways to do business and not
every startup has to grow into a multi-million dollar business.
"Understanding what and why you are doing something is crucial. If you
are building a bootstrapped, sustainable business, be sure you are
building it right. As an entrepreneur, I wanted to build a very good
productI did not think about monetisation, but wanted a lot of VC
fundingThose things do not match together. There has to be a
trajectory," he says.

Then, there were other challenges - aligning the entrepreneurial journey
with priorities.

Being raised by a single mother, family has always been very crucial for
Brijraj. "Earlier I wanted to focus on my family and spend time with my
children. Now that my children are grown up, I am back to focusing on
the startup world," he says.

He also emphasises that being young can no longer be an excuse for not
knowing how things work. Considering the amount of information available
today, one can easily research and gain insights to build a successful
business.

On raising funds

Spry raised $3 million in its seed round from FJ Labs, Pareto, Knowledge
Capital, AngelList, Whiteboard Capital, founders of Innovaccer, and from
C-suite executives from SoftBank, Qualcomm, TPG, and Blackrock.

While raising capital is never an easy task, being a seasoned
entrepreneur and formerly associated with Ola did make the job a little
easier for Brijraj this time. "I have scaled a startup from zero, and I
have also worked with an already scaled startup - these factors provide
me certain advantages over first-time entrepreneurs," he says.

From being a consumer-focused entrepreneur and dealing with the Indian
market to pivoting into a B2B company and focusing on the US markets,
the transition has been rocky for Brijraj.

"I did not start Spry to raise funds, I saw a bigger opportunity in the
US and I wanted to leverage on that. After working in Ola and from
learning the best, I have realised that thinking has to be backwards,"
Brijraj signs off.

Is failure the new success?

The 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. Clouds hang heavy. A rapt
crowd awaits. It's the 400m sprint semi-finals. The athletes line up.
One man is pipped to be the favourite - sprinter Derek Redmond, a
world-record holder.

As the gun pops, Redmond, a champion sprinter looks assured, aiming for
the final finish. But with 100m to go, Redmond pulls his hamstring and
goes down in agony. Just like that, his Olympic dreams come to a
stumbling halt.

Yet, in moments that would redefine the meaning of courage, he picks
himself up, crying in pain, and aided by his father hobbles to the
finish line. A moved crowd gives him a standing ovation.

Derek's story is one of the most inspiring stories. By the traditional
measure of success, Derek failed. In fact, he was disqualified due to
outside assistance. Derek didn't participate in another Olympics after
that injury. But footage of that epic race was used by Nike in its
'Courage' commercials, by Visa, and the International Olympic Committee.

He would go on to become a personal trainer, a motivational speaker, and
start a sports equipment manufacturing company, continually transforming
the seeds of that failure into wider avenues of success.

And then, there is an old story of Angulimala - the ferocious bandit who
created a necklace from the thumbs of his victims. Yet, when Angulimala
met the Buddha, he is believed to have been filled with remorse for his
acts, transforming his life after that and becoming one of his greatest
disciples. There are many dramatic stories like these not just in sports
or in mythology, but also business.

Walt Disney filed for bankruptcy when he was in his early twenties
before turning around to create one of the world's most successful
entertainment companies.

Steve Jobs was fired from the company he founded only to come back to
take the helm and carry it to unprecedented heights.

My point - inspiring as these stories are - is not merely to provide
inspirational succour but to consider our failures, our losses, and
endings as reflective points on our life's personal and professional
journeys. Failure can shake us. Failure can be defeating, but it need
not be debilitating. How can we use failure as transformational triggers
in our life?

The power of reflection

All transformation comes from deep reflection. A transformation usually
occurs from a painful or uncomfortable situation that causes us to
reflect on the event in ways that bring about change. In this case, an
uncomfortable situation can be a startup that failed. Or a relationship
that is floundering. Or a job that we lost. An interview that we didn't
clear. We then choose our future actions based on our struggles with
that situation.

John Maxwell, in his book, Failing Forward, makes the pertinent point
that successful people take a specific approach to failure. They tend to
take responsibility for their actions, learn from the mistakes,
understand that failure is part of the learning process of life itself,
and despite the fear of failure, continue to take risks and persevere.
Maxwell, in the book, called this approach "failing forward."

Ideally, when we fail, we should think about what can we learn from
that. Why did we fail? What didn't work? We don't have to romanticise
our mistakes, but we do need to learn from them. But we often don't. We
don't see the benefits of reflection in the pain of our failure.

There is a tendency to say, "It wasn't my fault at all!" it was someone
or something else. That is not a thoughtful reflection on all the
reasons why something didn't work out.

I have met with founders who are looking to start a new company after
their last startup failed. Some, of course, reflect upon their previous
experience, understand what they learned from that, and what they would
do differently the next time around.

Yet, there are others who say that the failure was extrinsic. Perhaps,
they didn't receive the right backing from investors at the right time.
Perhaps, they didn't have the right co-founder. Perhaps this. Or perhaps
that. But the focus on self-reflection and what more could you have done
with what was in your control should not be deflected.

Transform using failure

"Our experiences are tools in our transformational process" - Daaji
Kamlesh Patel, The Heartfulness Institute.

I have learned through the course of my life that we need not allow
failure to define our capabilities or cast limitations on our growth.

In Star Wars:The Last Jedi, Yoda said, "The greatest teacher, failure
is." In that spirit, I really believe that looking at what I got right,
both in my personal as well as professional life, and what I got wrong,
has taught me not only some important things about life's many
situations but also how I can use these tools of reflection to build a
stronger outlook on life.

These aren't guiding principles but ways of thinking that help me
reflect and analyse better the outcome of any situation.

Failure is a constant learning opportunity

Given today's overly glorified success stories, we often don't think of
failure as providing us with immense chances to learn. But we must
follow up failure with an in-depth analysis. The problem is that our
failures become contaminated by our emotions. But we must try to
disregard the negative emotions surrounding that experience and reflect
on all the relevant steps we undertook to reach the point we are at now.

In the 1950s, Taiichi Ohno, who developed the Toyota Production System,
used the "why" method to ask workers to reflect on problems on the shop
floor. His method was simple: Just ask "why" five times to arrive at the
root cause of a problem. Toyota would go on to use this system
successfully over the next few decades.

For example, if your digital marketing campaign failed, you could ask:

Why did our marketing campaign fail?

"Because we didn't have a sufficient budget."

Why didn't we receive a sufficient budget?

And so on.

Avoid the blame game

We tend to look at all our failures, personal or professional, from the
same perspective: we did something wrong. We failed. We didn't succeed.
Full stop.

I believe the point of reflecting well is not to affix blame - not on
yourself and not on others - but to truly reflect and develop an
understanding that will help improve the chances of success in the next
venture, job, or relationship. Being open to learning means that you can
reflect on the painful situation without becoming defensive or
egoistical. Encouraging a learning environment, be it at home or work,
means that we can sow the seeds of transformation without fear.

Use questions like these to trigger reflection:

Why, how, and with what purpose did you or the team do this?

What was the trigger for the action?

Was there an alternative path that you or the team could have taken?

How would other people react in the same situation?

Whether it's the failure of a startup or even an idea, failure,
rejections, or challenges, these things often force us to confront the
parts of ourselves that are hidden away, the dark shadows that cast a
shroud on our experiences.

But reflecting on the situations that don't go as you planned, or life's
challenges that didn't work out, can cast light on these dark crevices
and present us with solutions for the next set of challenges that we
undoubtedly will face.

What didn't work well? Could you have done something better? Worked
harder? Were we prepared better? These are the kind of questions that
can transform us. This kind of self-reflection helps you to accept
failure and constantly improve. If we live in denial of our failures and
challenges, we will never learn from them.

You can serve mass market in India only if you're able to appeal to all
languages: Virendra Gupta

MINT

February 16, 2018 Friday

Bengaluru, Feb. 16 -- Dailyhunt is one of the few start-ups in the
digital content space that has caught attention among both investors and
users. Dailyhunt's roots can be traced back to the telecom market before
the advent of mobile apps, when it used to be a VAS player. As the
Internet started growing among Indian consumers, digital transformation
was inevitable and Dailyhunt made a successful pivot from a traditional
content distributor to a mobile news aggregator with over 50 million
users. It also raised more than $60 million from multiple investors,
including Internet-focused venture capitalists (VCs) like Sequoia
(Capital India) and Matrix Partners India. Mint caught up with Virendra
Gupta, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Dailyhunt to tell
its growth story .

Why is Dailyhunt only news-focused?

So, what interests me is the mass market at the core level. What
interests me is creating impact in the mass market, and that's what I
have done all my life. I started working with the mass market from 1995
to 1997, when I was with telecom operators and other telecom companies.
And when we were choosing to build things at that time, we chose to
build things like prepaid top-up, e-recharge in Airtel. I feel that on
the content space, especially in the local language content space in
India, we have just touched the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot of
scope and a lot of growth opportunities and a lot of ideas to implement.

Once we acquired Newshunt in 2012, we were looking to serve the mass
market. And when it hit the market, there were a lot of things that we
observed. So at that time, from our perspective, India had a 10% English
literacy rate. Seventy-percent literacy was on the local language side.
All the people who are going online are local language users.

You can serve the mass market in India only if you are able to appeal to
all languages, and all sets of users-old users, middle-aged users, young
users... So, when we started looking at the market this way we found
that in some cases, news is the best-suited content category for growing
a user base. So, that's why we decided that news is our destination.

What's next for Dailyhunt in the next five years?

There are multiple trends happening in content. When we look at these
trends, we ask ourselves, which areas do we get into, and which areas we
shouldn't. There are a lot of areas which can get you a lot of traffic.
But they are not what you want to be as a brand, and some areas are
non-monetizable as well. So, when I look at the content landscape, I
think we want to serve multiple segments of this market. We want to
appeal to the entertainment segment, lifestyle segment, women's segment
as well as the tech news and content segment. Looking at content
tailored for the women audience, the next set of people who are going to
come online are going to be women, and that's a highly monetizable
segment.

So, next is more hyperlocal content. If you look at any newspaper, what
gets printed is just 10% of what gets generated online because the
newspaper has only a limited size. When you start becoming more local,
there is a lot of hyperlocal content to tap. A lot of great videos,
informative videos, spiritual videos, entertainment videos. We won't
indulge in soft-porn content, we don't want to be in that segment at
all. We will mostly look at something like lifestyle videos and
self-help videos. Then there are things like cricket, it does very well.
We have cricket sections, and scoreboards and all that. We create
special properties on our app during elections.

So when the election was happening, according to Akamai (Technologies),
we were the second most used site, in spite of us not having videos. So,
we can carve out specific content around specific events. There is a lot
of horizontal play...there is a lot of customized play involved.

How does Dailyhunt manage to maintain its office culture, which is a mix
of both a newsroom and a corporate office?

We are a good mix of online and offline. The way we are working is very
different. The tech way of working is very different. The journalistic
way of content is very different. And I think what makes this company
more exciting is a good amalgamation of all this. There is a huge amount
of learning, and everyone learns from each other, which also motivates
them to perform better. I think the value which humans create using
content is huge, and you cannot demystify that. At a scale, what the
machine does, the humans can't do. Our ad sales team, they go to the
street and fight for every ad dollar. So, I think what makes this
company is a good harmonious culture with a lot of diversity coming in
from different teams.

How do you keep the company afloat only on advertising revenue, since
you don't charge users?

There has to be some business model, either customers have to pay or
advertisers have to pay. Without that, nothing can happen, we can't keep
our eyes closed to that. That's not what we are. To build a sustainable
advertising business, you need to have a sufficiently large user base.
If you don't have a sufficiently large base, and a sufficiently engaged
base, and a destination to which a brand can associate itself with, you
won't make money online. Ad networks won't give you the big money. I
think India's story of advertising is a very strong mass market, based
on what brands advertise on TV and newspaper. We have built an
organization which goes and sells ad spaces to these big brands, with
different ad formats for each brand category. So before doing this, you
need to have critical distributional reach and engagement, to engage any
meaningful ad dollars. Secondly, you need to be a brand, with whom
people want to associate with. You also have to build organization to
leverage all this and we have successfully built one.

How can IT policies, industry policies be used to shape growth of Indic
language content in India?

See, I'm a firm believer of free market. And I think what the department
of telecom (DoT) is doing by mandating 22 Indian languages on mobile
phones is very nice, because it ensures that digital inclusion happens
faster than what it would normally take. I think coupled with that, a
lot of things like land records, lot of things like that should happen
in local languages. Even transaction systems for the mass market, online
job vacancy portals, government schemes for poor, health schemes
information, or any other government and municipal level information
should be made available in Indic languages, both offline and online.

What are the investors thinking about investing in media start-ups?

I think, what struck a chord with the investors was that, we were
addressing large sets of users, which is actually a part of the online
Internet base. So, whenever any investor evaluates your business, they
look at the potential total addressable market. Our product easily took
off with our target user base, and there was a good amount of user
retention. So, these were the things that struck with the investors. We
were addressing the vernacular market, so everybody who was betting on
the Indian growth story was looking at the potential of the Indic
language market. Because if you can't address this market, then there is
no growth story. So to me, that was the core value proposition, and the
content was the way to reach out to the users, and to acquire and to
create stickiness among users.

What or who inspired you to take up entrepreneurship?

What fundamentally inspires me is innovation, and the thrill of always
breaking things and creating something new. Fundamentally, that's how
I'm wired. And that's what drives me. If you just go back 15-20 years in
history, the start-ups of that time were telecom companies, and the
penetration of mobile phones was very low.

So, I was a part of that industry that was constantly growing.
Innovation, fast-beat things, mass market, they drove me at that time.
And that's why creating a great product and doing it to scale remained
an objective.

Is there any one person/company who inspires you?

There are many, there a lot of favourites, it's difficult to pinpoint
one company or a person. So the way I look at it, frankly, I feel very
blessed to be in India and to be in this ecosystem where we have got a
chance to build something to be able to execute your own ideas, and to
create an impact on the mass market. To me, that's how I see
entrepreneurship.

People across the globe have made huge companies, and you know all the
names, and those are also the people I also admire. People back home,
who started from scratch to large companies. We admire all those
companies; to me there is a learning everywhere. There is a learning
from somebody's success to learning from somebody's failure.

Are start-ups solving problems anymore? What advice would you give to
new entrepreneurs out there?

There are certain things that I like about the ecosystem, and certain
things that I don't like among current start-ups. What I like is their
fearlessness, I think that's great. When I was particularly at a younger
age, I don't think I was that fearless, as they are. I think being true
to yourself, when you are solving a problem, I think that's very
important. Because, eventually from an entrepreneur, that's what
matters. If I explain you a problem, you may not understand it the right
away. But if I understand that problem, and if I'm being true to myself
then you take the right decisions, and solution, and then that's
achievement. So, never have a misconception about what you are solving.

Telecom consumers, at the time, largely relied on mobile VAS providers
to download content like ringtones, pictures and music.

But the problem was that mobile VAS companies like Verse Innovation had
no direct channel to consumers, and telcos built a monopoly-like
structure to keep their revenue flowing.

Users belonged to telecom networks and Verse Innovation shared revenue
with telcos from each download. But this didn't last for long, as mobile
data climbed to faster speeds, and the era of executable mobile apps
fascinated consumers.

BITS Pilani's Conquest is accelerating Indian startup ecosystem through
startup-investor-mentor collaboration

DNA

The core purpose of any enterprise is to solve real-world problems,
earning revenue by offering services that people esteem to be of value.
Moreover, the net value-add of their service must be higher than that of
any other provider, or else they will simply be replaced in today's
competitive landscape. In this context, it is imperative to examine the
roles played by three key stakeholders in the startup ecosystem:
early-stage startups, investors, and mentors. These players have
interlocking interests that together contribute significantly to the
growth and development of the ecosystem as a whole.

While it is undeniable that the lack of a viable business idea remains a
primary reason for startup failure, even ventures with strong concepts,
exceptional teams, and disruptive market potential can falter due to the
treacherous trifecta- lack of reliable sources of funding, expert
guidance, and extensive networks to fuel their growth. These three
crucial elements are inherently required by any startup in its early
stages.

The next stakeholder in the ecosystem, investors, play a pivotal role in
the startup ecosystem, driven by their aim to generate substantial
returns on investment by backing ventures that exhibit promising growth
prospects. Investors actively seek out a consistent pipeline of
high-quality startups that are open to investment, allowing the latter
to fulfill capital-intensive goals. This symbiotic relationship between
investors and startups creates a win-win situation, enabling both
parties to reap the rewards of their collaboration.

And finally, we have mentors and coaches. Experienced, wise, and wanting
to give back, these mentors are perhaps the most admirable of all the
key players discussed. Bringing free expertise on highly specific
issues, a mentor's key role is to improve a startup's decision-making.
There are a variety of ways this could happen, such as by offering past
experience, better ecosystem knowledge, a comprehensive and deep
understanding of the important aspects, and so on.

Amidst this backdrop, startup accelerators emerge as a beacon of hope
for startups, offering a transformative platform to nurture and empower
the next generation of entrepreneurs. As India's first and largest
student-run startup accelerator, Conquest brings together these three
key stakeholders and performs the legwork necessary to make it a
seamless experience for all those involved. Since its inception in 2004,
it has directly impacted more than 5000 startups from all over India,
disbursing INR 1 Cr+ of equity-free grants in the last 3 years alone.

Conquest is an initiative by the Centre for Entrepreneurial Leadership
(CEL), BITS Pilani, and aims to support early stage startups through a
7-week hybrid program. The program places a strong emphasis on
networking, recognizing the power of connections in the startup world.
This exposure not only opens doors to potential investors but also
fosters collaboration and partnerships.

All this is coupled with personalized mentorship and insightful sessions
led by industry experts that dive into the core elements encompassing
refinement of business models, formulation of growth strategies, and
resolution of operational obstacles. The zero-cost, zero-equity model
ensures that the founder has to stake nothing at all but gets access to
the most essential elements required for their startup's growth,
including funding, resources, connections, and guidance throughout the
program. Early-stage startup founders can register for Conquest's 19th
edition through their website, conquest.org.in
