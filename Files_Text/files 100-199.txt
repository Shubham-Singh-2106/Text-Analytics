Israel is not for sale. But if it were, we now know what Israel is
worth, thanks to a study by the World Bank and the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange. If shares in Israel Inc. were floated on the stock exchange,
they would be worth 17.6 trillion shekels (4.8 trillion dollars), claim
the experts.

If a buyer acquired Israel, he or she would own Israel's annual 350
billion dollar GDP. This implies a modest annual rate of return on
investment of about 7 percent. Keep in mind the substantial risk
premium.

Just to put things in proportion, on Thursday, August 2, Apple shares
closed at a record high of $207.39, bringing Apple's market value to
just over 1 trillion dollars, a historical first for a single company.
Hence, all of Israel is worth just a bit less than five (Macintosh)
Apples.

Apple employs 123,000 people. Israel's labor force is four million. So
each Apple worker generates 6.8 times more wealth than each Israeli
worker.

Apart from my deplorable addiction to numbers, burned into all
economists' DNA, there is a point to these numbers.

Israel brands itself as the Start-up Nation, ever since Dan Senor and
Saul Singer's blockbuster 2011 book by that name. The website they
launched, Start-up Nation Central, acts as matchmaker, linking foreign
investors and companies with some 5,500 Israeli start-ups. And according
to Bloomberg, this is the highest number of start-ups per capita in the
world.

The Amazon promo for "Start-up Nation" asks rhetorically, "How is it
that Israel - a country of 7.1 million [now 8.5 million], only 60 years
old [now 70], surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since
its founding, with no natural resources, [OK, we have natural gas now] -
produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable
nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada and the UK?"

Start-up Nation Central analyst Rinat Korbet has written an upbeat
analysis of Israel's high-tech industry. "The first six months of 2018
were characterized by global record-breaking venture capital deal
values," she wrote. "...The Israeli high-tech industry is both growing
in the amount of money raised by its tech start-ups, and maturing (a
growing layer of maturing companies). It is enjoying the fruits of
previous successes and innovations, the knowledge accumulated by serial
entrepreneurs and multinationals based in Israel, also the continuous
flow of capital from abroad."

Let me put these glowing words and numbers into perspective. Small
nations like Israel focus on quality, not quantity. It is the quality of
our start-ups that matter, not the quantity. Look at what one Apple, one
Teva, one Check Point, or one Mobileye can contribute.

Measured by quality, Israel's start-ups are far from world-beaters. Only
4 percent achieve profitability and sustained independent growth,
according to the Israel Venture Center. Measured by successful start-ups
per capita, Israel is somewhat of a bust.

But why? Why do so many start-ups fail? Is it baked into the cake? Some
think so.

After I published an opinion piece in the business daily TheMarker
bemoaning the astronomical start-up failure rate, renowned patent lawyer
Dr. Esther Luzatto berated me in response, in print. She argued that
"the fact that so few start-ups reach maturity is inherent in the global
technology game. The fact is, private money - the litmus test of the
technological system - is invested in start-ups, even in those likely to
close. The venture capital model knows how to take into account success
and failure."

In other words, if smart money invests in start-ups, despite the odds,
why fix something that isn't broken?

But I am unconvinced. After several decades as an educator at MIT and
the Technion, teaching creativity and innovation, and lately, after some
research, I believe I now know in part why such a high proportion of
Israeli start-ups fail.

Most start-ups are driven by engineering, science and technology. And
most entrepreneurs are engineers or scientists. But entrepreneurship is
an art, not a science. Former Apple guru Guy Kawasaki observed that
"entrepreneurship is a state of mind, not a job definition." And the
state of mind is that of an artist.

Suppose we decide that for entrepreneurs, quality, not quantity, of
start-ups is the objective - the fraction that succeed, become
profitable and achieve sustained growth. How can the quality of Israel's
start-ups - their business design, strategy, and hard-headed management
focus - be improved?

Technology-driven entrepreneurs emerge largely from science and
technology universities and faculties. This is the core of the problem.
The art of entrepreneurship emerges, like a butterfly, from the cocoon
of science and technology, an inherent mismatch. And partly for that
reason, most start-up butterflies never fly.

Science is the study of the physical and natural world and the laws that
govern it. Technology is the application of science for practical
purposes. And entrepreneurship? It is the art of applying creative skill
and imagination to technology, in order to create value, for thousands
or millions.

Science seeks to discover the basic rules of nature. Entrepreneurs seek
to intelligently break the rules, to create innovative, useful products
and services.

Kawasaki is the marketing guru who helped Apple and Steve Jobs make the
Macintosh computer a huge hit. He later wrote a book, "The Art of the
Start," now updated as "The Art of the Start 2.0." It is one of the best
and most practical books on how to launch a successful start-up.

The title explains itself. Science follows the rigid scientific method.
Art tries to make things, and do things, differently from everyone else.
If your innovation is not ten times, fifty times better than what
exists, and totally unique, Kawasaki counsels, then forget it.

Consider Pablo Picasso. For over 70 years, he repeatedly smashed the
rules of painting and sculpture. Picasso invented constructed sculpture
and co-invented the collage art style. Both broke the rules. His works
thrill us not because they followed the rules of art but because they
annihilated them.

"If you know what you are going to do," Picasso once said, "why bother
doing it?" This is utterly contrary to the MBA approach to management,
which lays down rigid rules, the right way.

A study led by my Neaman Institute colleague Prof. Arnon Bentur and his
team on the future of engineering education found that graduates of
engineering universities lack key 'soft' skills, such as teamwork and
communicating, according to industry experts who employ them. They
recommend a shift to project-based learning, which simulates the way
engineers (and artists) work in the real world.

My Neaman Institute colleagues Tsipy Buchnik, Vered Segal and I just
published a study of Technion graduates who later launched start-ups, in
the Journal of Entrepreneurship Education. Technion entrepreneurs
reported that the Technion activities that proved most helpful to them
by far were the experiential simulations - hackathons, three-day
start-ups, and the year-long Biztech competition, in which teams of
participants ideate and build businesses around those ideas.

This is because the way artists learn their craft is by practicing it,
in a studio setting. For instance, at Jerusalem's famed Bezalel Academy,
2,000 art students hone their creative skills in design studios, under
experienced mentors.

Perhaps the way budding entrepreneurs can best hone their craft is in a
studio setting - by doing it, first in dry simulations and perhaps
later, in 'wet' (real) ones. Isn't this why the IDF 8200 Military
Intelligence unit spawns so many successful start-ups? Its graduates
practice the Art of the Start in the unit, by leading projects they have
dreamed up. When they finish their tour of duty and actually launch a
start-up, they've already practiced the art several times and have
expertise. This is how Check Point was born, in 1993. Founders Gil
Schwed, Marius Nacht and Shlomo Kramer were already seasoned IDF
entrepreneurs before they launched it.

If building a successful start-up is an art, then it should be learned
and taught as an art. This simple axiom must be more widely embraced in
Israel's science and technology institutions. If it is, a higher
proportion of start-ups will succeed. And quality will triumph over
quantity.

Over 1 lakh jobs at risk, 10K startups face payroll failure: Y
Combinator CEO

IANS-English

March 12, 2023 Sunday

New Delhi, March 12 (IANS) US-based technology startup accelerator Y
Combinator, which has invested in thousands of startups, including at
least 200 from India, has written a petition to US Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen and others, asking them to prevent further shockwaves that
could lead to financial crisis and layoffs of more than 100,000 workers.

Over 1,200 CEOs and founders representing over 56,000 employees have
already signed the petition, written by Garry Tan, CEO and President of
Y Combinator, to save startups and hundreds of thousands of jobs.

"We ask for relief and attention to an immediate critical impact on
small businesses, startups, and their employees who are depositors at
the bank," read the petition.

According to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), Silicon
Valley Bank has over 37,000 small businesses with more than $250,000 in
deposits.

"These balances are now unavailable to them, and without further
intervention, according to the FDIC website, may be inaccessible for
months to years," the petition further said.

In the Y Combinator community, one-third of startups with exposure to
SVB used SVB as their sole bank account.

"As a result, they will fail to have the cash to run payroll in the next
30 days. By that measure, we can estimate that payroll-related furlough
or shutdown will impact more than 10,000 small businesses and startups,"
Tan wrote.

If the average small business or startup employs 10 workers, this will
have an immediate effect of furlough, layoff, or shutdown, affecting
over 100,000 jobs in the most vibrant sector of innovation in our
economy, he lamented.

Silicon Valley Bank's failure has a real risk of systemic contagion. Its
collapse has already instilled fear among founders and management teams
to look for safer havens for their remaining cash, which can trigger a
bank run on every other smaller bank.

He asked regulators that small business depositors at Silicon Valley
Bank should be made whole.

"Regulators need to conduct a backstop of depositors. We are not asking
for a bank bailout. Congress should work to restore stronger regulatory
oversight and capital requirements for regional banks, and any
malfeasance or mismanagement on the part of SVB executives leading to
this failure should be investigated," Tan elaborated.

April 20 -- While the global pandemic has bought economies to a halt and
massively disrupted businesses, it has also fuelled start-up dreams and
we even saw several Indian start-ups achieve Unicorn status during the
pandemic period. The times have never been better for the budding
entrepreneurs to give wings to their start-up dreams.

The Government, too, has come up with various schemes to support its
'Vocal for Local' drive. A case in point is the recent Rs 1,000 crore
Start-up India Seed Fund announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
during the Start-up India International Summit 2021 held earlier this
year.

Adgully is turning the spotlight on the entrepreneurs who fought against
all odds to bring their dreams to fruition in our special series
- START-UP STARS. We at Adgully wholeheartedly support the 'Vocal for
Local' movement and over the next few months will be featuring all
local/ homegrown businesses, brands and Apps.

Conceptualised as a lightweight fine jewellery brand for everyday wear,
Melorra is a start-up with the potential to disrupt the Indian jewellery
market as it stands today. So far, Melorra has delivered to over 2,000
towns in the country and made its mark everywhere - from villages with a
population of less than 10,000 to cities with population above 1
million.

 

 

 

 

 

In conversation with Adgully, Saroja Yeramilli, Founder and CEO,
Melorra, takes us through her journey as an entrepreneur, the strong
headwinds for the Indian start-up ecosystem and much more.

Please take us through your journey as an entrepreneur. What motivated
you to establish your start-up? What were you doing prior to turning an
entrepreneur?

In my career spanning over two decades, I have worked with some of the
world's leading consumer brands, including Ogilvy, Titan, Tanishq,
Marico - Kaya and Dell, in various positions. It was during a visit to
one of the well-known jewellery stores a few years ago that I chanced
upon a conversation between a mother-daughter duo who were buying
jewellery. The daughter's reluctance to buy jewellery she couldn't wear
on a daily basis stayed with me and inspired me to start Melorra, a
start-up with the potential to disrupt the Indian jewellery market as it
stands today. The conversation made me aware of the huge gap in the kind
of jewellery young women want and what traditional players were
offering.

Melorra was conceptualised as a lightweight fine jewellery brand
designing affordable jewellery for everyday wear. Inspired by
international fashion trends, our designs are lightweight and stylish,
keeping the modern woman's changing needs in mind. We have launched four
new physical experience centres recently. The first one was in Bangalore
and the three others are in Delhi/NCR. Our brick-and-mortar expansion is
intended as a seamless extension of our online retail space providing
customers with anytime, anywhere lightweight and trendy gold jewellery.
We plan to launch 350 such centres pan India in the next few years. The
stores, which will primarily be located in malls and high streets across
India, will range from 500-1,500 sq ft in size and showcase 500-1,000
jewellery designs. Melorra has proved its business model and we continue
to improve our offerings every time. For our recent offline foray, we
plan to invest around $50 million over the next 6 years.

So far, Melorra has delivered to over 2,000 towns in the country and
made its mark everywhere - from villages with a population of less than
10,000 to cities with population above 1 million. The offline centres
are an extension of our online space. Melorra has a very strong customer
base in both metros and smaller towns alike. Our customers in the Tier 2
and 3 cities are also waiting for a Melorra experience center and we
plan to also branch out to these areas going forward.

What need gap did you want to fulfil with your start-up? What is the
core business proposition?

Fine jewellery has always been looked upon as an investment, with
purchases driven by special occasions like weddings. Most of the
jewellery industry caters to this segment and lacks trendy options that
can be paired with the western wardrobe. Consumers today are also more
in sync with recent trends in jewellery and fashion. There is an
increase in their disposable incomes that has led to a change in their
lifestyles and preferences. All these factors have resulted in increased
demand for trendy, contemporary and versatile fine jewellery.

We create and sell precious jewellery through our online portal,
www.melorra.com, and now our experience stores also meet the modern
requirements of the new Indian woman. Melorra combines technology and
fast-changing weekly fashion trends to deliver exclusive gold and
diamond jewellery to customers.

We are working towards changing the perception that gold jewellery is
only meant for the lockers, and integrating it with women's everyday
wardrobe.

How did you identify your TG? Did you carry out any feasibility study
prior to starting your business?

Yes, before I started Melorra I carried out a pan India survey of
millennials and Gen Z and their fashion sense and their needs with
respect to gold jewellery. Their dissatisfaction with the offerings of
the traditional players that didn't meet young women's changing
lifestyle needs led to the launch of Melorra.

What were the challenges that you faced in your start-up journey and how
did you overcome them?

I didn't face the usual challenges of founders, especially with regard
to fund raising. I raised the largest seed round in India of $5 million.

Funds/ finance is the prime issue of almost all start-ups. What can the
industry and the Government do to address this issue and ease the
capital requirements of start-ups?

Funding has never been a challenge for us and we raised the largest seed
round and multiple rounds post that, we recently raised $12.50 million
in an oversubscribed funding round led by Symphony Asia (one of Asia's
first private equity firms), Lightbox Ventures, Alteria Capital and
other leading family offices.

Finances dictate a start-up's success or failure and this is where
funding becomes imperative. A start-up goes through multiple rounds of
funding during its growth phase, at the core of which lies a solid idea
and a plan on how this will be executed. It is important to understand
that most investors will focus their attention on the core team and
ideation. The government can ensure simplification of business, which
can be facilitated by the implementation of the National Ecommerce
Policy. By making it simpler and easier to do business, we can attract
more foreign direct investment, which will in turn generate more
employment and economic growth in the country.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Modi announced a Startup India Seed
Fund. How do you see start-ups benefiting from it?

The Startup India Seed Fund announcement augurs well for entrepreneurs
who are looking at initial funding for their start-ups. India is one of
the largest start-up ecosystems in the world and this seed funding will
encourage budding entrepreneurs to take forward their ideas and not back
out due to lack of initial funding opportunities.

How is digital helping you further your business?

Melorra is on the cusp of fashion, jewellery and technology. We have
always been a digital-first company. From designing digitally with no
physical prototypes or inventory, to 3D printed manufacturing technology
to an online platform for selling through site and apps, to digital
marketing - Melorra is through and through a digital company. Even in
our offline experience centers digital is playing a key role in
storytelling and design launches.

What were your key learnings from 2020? How do you see the start-up
ecosystem progressing in 2021?

Melorra is primarily an online company offering the largest range of
over 10,000 original designs in lightweight gold jewellery. We have not
only recovered to pre-COVID-19 revenues, but have moved to a growth
phase of 20% year on year growth now.

There has been increased demand from all town classes, income strata and
even age groups now. Earlier, it was people younger than 35 years
shopping online, but now there is demand even from the older age groups.
Our ticket size has gone up 65% compared to pre-COVID levels since
people have started feeling comfortable shopping for more expensive
jewellery items such as necklaces, heavy gold chains, bangles online. We
are forecasting the best year end revenues this March than we have ever
had and are accelerating our expansion plans since the recovery out of
lockdown has been so strong.

India is not only one the largest start-up ecosystems in the world, but
is also on the cusp of a massive growth in start-ups. Many start-ups in
e-commerce have now reached maturity and 2021 could well herald a new
phase of large IPOs by start-ups.

What would be your message for the budding entrepreneurs?

My advice to budding entrepreneurs would be to believe in their idea and
follow their dream wholeheartedly. Despite initial challenges that every
entrepreneur faces, with diligence and persistence, the outcome is also
positive. There is no better time to be an entrepreneur in India! From
government support to interest from domestic and foreign investors to
the best talent pool to, most importantly, a large and growing domestic
market - India offers the best opportunity now!

Smartphone investors place bet on Nothing; Technology

A consumer electronics start-up called Nothing has secured financing of
more than $200mn to launch its debut smartphone, in the first attempt
for several years by a newcomer to crack a market dominated by Apple and
Samsung.

Nothing unveiled the design of its first smartphone, called Phone (1)
this week, before it goes on general sale this summer. The device has a
transparent back, revealing electronic components such as a wireless
charging coil that are normally hidden, and runs on the Android
operating system.

The group's backers include Alphabet's venture capital arm, EQT Ventures
and former Apple designer Tony Fadell. They are betting that Carl Pei,
Nothing's chief executive, who previously cofounded Chinese smartphone
brand OnePlus, can succeed where even Andy Rubin, the co-founder of the
Android mobile operating system, failed.

Rubin's start-up Essential raised $330mn but shut down in 2020 after its
2017 smartphone launch sold fewer than 100,000 units in its first six
months, according to estimates by research firm IDC at the time.

"I come from a very hardware centric background and he comes from a very
software centric background," Pei said of Rubin in an interview with the
Financial Times. "People with more credibility than I have tried and
failed ... They underestimated the complexity of this industry."

After several years where most smartphones have come to resemble Apple's
iPhone designs, Pei said, "people are yearning for something new".

After the failure of start-ups such as Essential that attempted to offer
more novel designs, the smartphone market has become more concentrated.

According to researchers Counterpoint, just four companies accounted for
almost three-quarters of the 1.4bn smartphones sold globally last year.

Pei's previous venture, OnePlus, is part of China-based BBK Electronics,
which has become the fourth-biggest smartphone performer alongside
Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi, through a range of brands including Oppo,
Vivo and Realme.

That concentration has made launching a new handset even more difficult
in recent years, Pei admitted. Manufacturers are more reluctant to work
with newcomers after being burnt by low sales of earlier start-ups.
Obtaining components, many of which are already constrained across the
industry, is more challenging for new entrants with lower volumes.

Last year, Nothing initially ordered about 700,000 screens for its first
run of Phone (1) but has been able to increase that order after raising
more capital and building confidence among distributors with last year's
launch of its first product, a pair of wireless earbuds that sport the
same transparent casing as its forthcoming phone. Nothing has shipped
530,000 units of Ear (1) since the device went on general sale last
August.

That helped to "prove to the market that this team cannot only design a
really beautiful product, but can manufacture and sell it at scale", Pei
said. "Using this proof point, we raised more money to be able to build
a smartphone. And if the smartphone subsequently does well we can raise
more money to do the next thing we want to do."

Nothing has raised $144mn in equity funding and has a $65mn revolving
line of credit from its sales partners. The company is working with O2
in the UK, Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Flipkart in India to
distribute the phone when it launches, with ambitions eventually to
launch in the US if Phone (1) sells well.

With 330 staff, Nothing runs its supply chain and hardware from
Shenzhen, China, with design and marketing in Europe and other teams in
India, Taiwan and California. The intellectual property behind its
products is held in the UK.

Pei said: "I think the result of this product is that we will be
converting more iPhone users than other Android phones."

A consumer electronics start-up called Nothing has secured financing of
more than $200mn to launch its debut smartphone, in the first attempt
for several years by a newcomer to crack a market dominated by Apple and
Samsung.

Nothing unveiled the design of its first smartphone, called Phone (1)
this week, before it goes on general sale this summer. The device has a
transparent back, revealing electronic components such as a wireless
charging coil that are normally hidden, and runs on the Android
operating system.

The group's backers include Alphabet's venture capital arm, EQT Ventures
and former Apple designer Tony Fadell. They are betting that Carl Pei,
Nothing's chief executive, who previously cofounded Chinese smartphone
brand OnePlus, can succeed where even Andy Rubin, the co-founder of the
Android mobile operating system, failed.

Rubin's start-up Essential raised $330mn but shut down in 2020 after its
2017 smartphone launch sold fewer than 100,000 units in its first six
months, according to estimates by research firm IDC at the time.

"I come from a very hardware centric background and he comes from a very
software centric background," Pei said of Rubin in an interview with the
Financial Times. "People with more credibility than I have tried and
failed ... They underestimated the complexity of this industry."

After several years where most smartphones have come to resemble Apple's
iPhone designs, Pei said, "people are yearning for something new".

After the failure of start-ups such as Essential that attempted to offer
more novel designs, the smartphone market has become more concentrated.

According to researchers Counterpoint, just four companies accounted for
almost three-quarters of the 1.4bn smartphones sold globally last year.

Pei's previous venture, OnePlus, is part of China-based BBK Electronics,
which has become the fourth-biggest smartphone performer alongside
Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi, through a range of brands including Oppo,
Vivo and Realme.

That concentration has made launching a new handset even more difficult
in recent years, Pei admitted. Manufacturers are more reluctant to work
with newcomers after being burnt by low sales of earlier start-ups.
Obtaining components, many of which are already constrained across the
industry, is more challenging for new entrants with lower volumes.

2021 could well herald a new phase of large IPOs by start-ups: Saroja
Yeramilli

While the global pandemic has bought economies to a halt and massively
disrupted businesses, it has also fuelled start-up dreams and we even
saw several Indian start-ups achieve Unicorn status during the pandemic
period. The times have never been better for the budding entrepreneurs
to give wings to their start-up dreams.

The Government, too, has come up with various schemes to support its
'Vocal for Local' drive. A case in point is the recent Rs 1,000 crore
Start-up India Seed Fund announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
during the Start-up India International Summit 2021 held earlier this
year.

Adgully is turning the spotlight on the entrepreneurs who fought against
all odds to bring their dreams to fruition in our special series -
START-UP STARS. We at Adgully wholeheartedly support the 'Vocal for
Local' movement and over the next few months will be featuring all
local/ homegrown businesses, brands and Apps.

Conceptualised as a lightweight fine jewellery brand for everyday wear,
Melorra is a start-up with the potential to disrupt the Indian jewellery
market as it stands today. So far, Melorra has delivered to over 2,000
towns in the country and made its mark everywhere - from villages with a
population of less than 10,000 to cities with population above 1
million.

In conversation with Adgully, Saroja Yeramilli, Founder and CEO,
Melorra, takes us through her journey as an entrepreneur, the strong
headwinds for the Indian start-up ecosystem and much more.

Please take us through your journey as an entrepreneur. What motivated
you to establish your start-up? What were you doing prior to turning an
entrepreneur?

In my career spanning over two decades, I have worked with some of the
world's leading consumer brands, including Ogilvy, Titan, Tanishq,
Marico - Kaya and Dell, in various positions. It was during a visit to
one of the well-known jewellery stores a few years ago that I chanced
upon a conversation between a mother-daughter duo who were buying
jewellery. The daughter's reluctance to buy jewellery she couldn't wear
on a daily basis stayed with me and inspired me to start Melorra, a
start-up with the potential to disrupt the Indian jewellery market as it
stands today. The conversation made me aware of the huge gap in the kind
of jewellery young women want and what traditional players were
offering.

Melorra was conceptualised as a lightweight fine jewellery brand
designing affordable jewellery for everyday wear. Inspired by
international fashion trends, our designs are lightweight and stylish,
keeping the modern woman's changing needs in mind. We have launched four
new physical experience centres recently. The first one was in Bangalore
and the three others are in Delhi/NCR. Our brick-and-mortar expansion is
intended as a seamless extension of our online retail space providing
customers with anytime, anywhere lightweight and trendy gold jewellery.
We plan to launch 350 such centres pan India in the next few years. The
stores, which will primarily be located in malls and high streets across
India, will range from 500-1,500 sq ft in size and showcase 500-1,000
jewellery designs. Melorra has proved its business model and we continue
to improve our offerings every time. For our recent offline foray, we
plan to invest around $50 million over the next 6 years.

So far, Melorra has delivered to over 2,000 towns in the country and
made its mark everywhere - from villages with a population of less than
10,000 to cities with population above 1 million. The offline centres
are an extension of our online space. Melorra has a very strong customer
base in both metros and smaller towns alike. Our customers in the Tier 2
and 3 cities are also waiting for a Melorra experience center and we
plan to also branch out to these areas going forward.

What need gap did you want to fulfil with your start-up? What is the
core business proposition?

Fine jewellery has always been looked upon as an investment, with
purchases driven by special occasions like weddings. Most of the
jewellery industry caters to this segment and lacks trendy options that
can be paired with the western wardrobe. Consumers today are also more
in sync with recent trends in jewellery and fashion. There is an
increase in their disposable incomes that has led to a change in their
lifestyles and preferences. All these factors have resulted in increased
demand for trendy, contemporary and versatile fine jewellery.

We create and sell precious jewellery through our online portal,
www.melorra.com, and now our experience stores also meet the modern
requirements of the new Indian woman. Melorra combines technology and
fast-changing weekly fashion trends to deliver exclusive gold and
diamond jewellery to customers.

We are working towards changing the perception that gold jewellery is
only meant for the lockers, and integrating it with women's everyday
wardrobe.

How did you identify your TG? Did you carry out any feasibility study
prior to starting your business?

Yes, before I started Melorra I carried out a pan India survey of
millennials and Gen Z and their fashion sense and their needs with
respect to gold jewellery. Their dissatisfaction with the offerings of
the traditional players that didn't meet young women's changing
lifestyle needs led to the launch of Melorra.

What were the challenges that you faced in your start-up journey and how
did you overcome them?

I didn't face the usual challenges of founders, especially with regard
to fund raising. I raised the largest seed round in India of $5 million.

Funds/ finance is the prime issue of almost all start-ups. What can the
industry and the Government do to address this issue and ease the
capital requirements of start-ups?

Funding has never been a challenge for us and we raised the largest seed
round and multiple rounds post that, we recently raised $12.50 million
in an oversubscribed funding round led by Symphony Asia (one of Asia's
first private equity firms), Lightbox Ventures, Alteria Capital and
other leading family offices.

Finances dictate a start-up's success or failure and this is where
funding becomes imperative. A start-up goes through multiple rounds of
funding during its growth phase, at the core of which lies a solid idea
and a plan on how this will be executed. It is important to understand
that most investors will focus their attention on the core team and
ideation. The government can ensure simplification of business, which
can be facilitated by the implementation of the National Ecommerce
Policy. By making it simpler and easier to do business, we can attract
more foreign direct investment, which will in turn generate more
employment and economic growth in the country.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Modi announced a Startup India Seed
Fund. How do you see start-ups benefiting from it?

The Startup India Seed Fund announcement augurs well for entrepreneurs
who are looking at initial funding for their start-ups. India is one of
the largest start-up ecosystems in the world and this seed funding will
encourage budding entrepreneurs to take forward their ideas and not back
out due to lack of initial funding opportunities.

How is digital helping you further your business?

Melorra is on the cusp of fashion, jewellery and technology. We have
always been a digital-first company. From designing digitally with no
physical prototypes or inventory, to 3D printed manufacturing technology
to an online platform for selling through site and apps, to digital
marketing - Melorra is through and through a digital company. Even in
our offline experience centers digital is playing a key role in
storytelling and design launches.

What were your key learnings from 2020? How do you see the start-up
ecosystem progressing in 2021?

Melorra is primarily an online company offering the largest range of
over 10,000 original designs in lightweight gold jewellery. We have not
only recovered to pre-COVID-19 revenues, but have moved to a growth
phase of 20% year on year growth now.

There has been increased demand from all town classes, income strata and
even age groups now. Earlier, it was people younger than 35 years
shopping online, but now there is demand even from the older age groups.
Our ticket size has gone up 65% compared to pre-COVID levels since
people have started feeling comfortable shopping for more expensive
jewellery items such as necklaces, heavy gold chains, bangles online. We
are forecasting the best year end revenues this March than we have ever
had and are accelerating our expansion plans since the recovery out of
lockdown has been so strong.

India is not only one the largest start-up ecosystems in the world, but
is also on the cusp of a massive growth in start-ups. Many start-ups in
e-commerce have now reached maturity and 2021 could well herald a new
phase of large IPOs by start-ups.

What would be your message for the budding entrepreneurs?

My advice to budding entrepreneurs would be to believe in their idea and
follow their dream wholeheartedly. Despite initial challenges that every
entrepreneur faces, with diligence and persistence, the outcome is also
positive. There is no better time to be an entrepreneur in India! From
government support to interest from domestic and foreign investors to
the best talent pool to, most importantly, a large and growing domestic
market - India offers the best opportunity now!

Over 1 Lakh Jobs At Risk, 10K Startups Face Payroll Failure: Y
Combinator CEO

Link to Story

New Delhi, March 12 (IANS) US-based technology startup accelerator Y
Combinator, which has invested in thousands of startups, including at
least 200 from India, has written a petition to US Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen and others, asking them to prevent further shockwaves that
could lead to financial crisis and layoffs of more than 100,000
workers.Over 1,200 CEOs and founders representing over 56,000 employees
have already signed the petition, written by Garry Tan, CEO and
President of Y Combinator, to save startups and hundreds of thousands of
jobs.

'We ask for relief and attention to an immediate critical impact on
small businesses, startups, and their employees who are depositors at
the bank,' read the petition.

According to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), Silicon
Valley Bank has over 37,000 small businesses with more than $250,000 in
deposits.

'These balances are now unavailable to them, and without further
intervention, according to the FDIC website, may be inaccessible for
months to years,' the petition further said.

In the Y Combinator community, one-third of startups with exposure to
SVB used SVB as their sole bank account.

'As a result, they will fail to have the cash to run payroll in the next
30 days. By that measure, we can estimate that payroll-related furlough
or shutdown will impact more than 10,000 small businesses and startups,'
Tan wrote.

If the average small business or startup employs 10 workers, this will
have an immediate effect of furlough, layoff, or shutdown, affecting
over 100,000 jobs in the most vibrant sector of innovation in our
economy, he lamented.

Silicon Valley Bank's failure has a real risk of systemic contagion. Its
collapse has already instilled fear among founders and management teams
to look for safer havens for their remaining cash, which can trigger a
bank run on every other smaller bank.

He asked regulators that small business depositors at Silicon Valley
Bank should be made whole.

'Regulators need to conduct a backstop of depositors. We are not asking
for a bank bailout. Congress should work to restore stronger regulatory
oversight and capital requirements for regional banks, and any
malfeasance or mismanagement on the part of SVB executives leading to
this failure should be investigated,' Tan elaborated.

As A Defence Startup, We See Ourselves As Problem Solvers: MWIVEN MD

On a Defence Start-Up, BW Defence speaks with with Jayaraghavendhar, the
Managing Director of MWIVEN. How a start-up company or a company with
skills in defence, which is so vital for the ecosystem, can contribute
in the nation building in the defence production and in the economy
overall? Excerpts of the conversation:

In our BW defence, we have been focusing on some of the key defence OEMs
across the world, collaborating with Indian defence. Focus has been on
the innovation and technology. Today, we are focusing on a vital part of
our defence ecosystem, what we call it start-up in defence.

How a start-up company or a company with skills in defence, which is so
vital for the ecosystem can contribute in the nation building in the
defence production and in the economy overall? Today to talk over many
such issues on the possibility and challenges, we have Jayaraghavendhar.
He is from MWIVEN, which is pronounced as Modern Warfare Integrated
Venture.

Let me give a bit of introduction about MWIVEN. MWIVEN is also
recognized in Indian Ministry of Defence to design Develop and
manufacture tactical missile system and GIS minefield recording system
MWIVEN is also recognized by the Department of promotion of industry and
internal trade under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. An MWIVEN is
more particularly as far as defence is concerned is a licensed
manufacturer of anti tank, missile system, remote control weapon
stations and anti tank guns in India, which is also be the collaboration
from the Belarusian OEM.

You are a very vital linker when everybody's talking about how a
start-up can scale up what can start do especially in defence, which
India is at threshold of building a big defence ecosystem. And I call it
a different ecosystem is as important part of our economy growth of
India. So I start with you by asking tabout your journey at the
start-up. How did you start and what exactly you offer in the defence?

Thank you very much for your great introduction. We start-ups definitely
need support from you and people like you to scale up. So to answer your
question, as a start-up, we just started, like any other start-up who
had no idea about defence and where to start, We started with the help
of a government organization for TANSIDCO initially to help us up
getting into this ecosystem and we gradually became a Indian Army's
authorized Design and Development Agency.

In respect to you, I've been a start-up for a long time, with lot of
failures and mistakes on the way.

So this is one of the start-up that I have ventured into. For me this
more than a start-up venture, this is about protecting the people who
protect us, it is just not about building a weapon system or becoming a
billion dollar company it is more about the accountability.

From the day, I started this company in May 2019. Till now we have come
a long way, in terms of scaling up with very limited resources with very
limited team.

The entire credit goes to government of India and government of Tamil
Nadu because they've been very instrumental in helping us out in
reaching the stage. So I would like to take this opportunity to thank
them for being kind and accommodating us all the way till here.

Right now we have two projects in hand, which is designing and
developing the third generation anti tank missile systems for Indian
Army and the minefield recording system for the Indian Army. So this is
where we reached and we have got a couple of projects, which we are
working out and submitting an RFI for. So hope we get that in next year.

So to begin with, you said you were lucky to be at right place at the
right time. But how did you get such contract? As a start-ups, how
easier was it for you to get into these technical contracts?

What I mean by being lucky to be in the right place at the right time is
that, there is a military doctrine shift in the way recent combat and
future combats to come and there is a change in government of India's
approach towards Private defense players and also there is No big
monopoly defense brands in India like other international defense
brands, there is a lot of opportunity for small companies like us to get
a share of market which is next to impossible in other developed
military Industrial complexes.

The process is very simple apply for expression of interest posted by
the respective forces and if you qualify, you are in the game.

We are one the fastest growing technology economy's in the world, the
most difficult part is the time it takes to prove yourself in this
sector to get these technical contracts is the challenge, anyone who
wish to enter should be ready to have the patience and keep their burn
rate as minimal as possible.

The general approach has to be that you should be prepared to fail in
your economics so you learn from its mistakes and improvise it, worst
which would happen to you is that your start-up failed in the process of
self reliance and which will be seen as one causality or the best a
martyr but if your product fails you are definitely a traitor because
somebody putting their life on the line trusting that your product will
deliver what it was promised and if the product fails then somebody is
bleeding because you didn't sweat enough.

So you are a start-up and you had no experience in defence, but you have
a technology experience in background, and you have some ideas, which
you think you can contribute, in terms of providing a weapon system to
our armed forces. How did you come up with this because there is a big
amount of R&D and there is always a capital resources involved? So how
would you build a case for your start-up for the armed forces or your
end user?

See , we need to fundamentally understand that our forces are not asking
us to fight along with them but asking us only to build some tools,
components and systems to protect us only and If we don't do those small
things, I don't think we should get into this defense industry and claim
to be a citizen of this country.

When it comes to technology in terms of defence ecosystem, it is already
existing and the required literature to learn is available everywhere.

So when an existing requirement is there, it is just a question of
bringing all technology and service requirement together. We have to
keep in mind that we are in the business of protecting the future and
nobody will give us a latest technology to our country, even assuming
that we are willing to pay an exorbitant price for it, So that is where
we see our opportunity. Because we see ourselves as problem solvers, and
not as someone who just adds a value to existing problem or a solution,
which is already there.

I would like you to talk about all the concrete projects and systems.
What are you planning for the Indian Army and what is the timeframe of
delivery?

Yes, definitely we are currently designing and developing a third
generation anti tank missile systems for the Indian Army, we are
expected to deliver our first prototype by end of next year. today we
see ourselves as a design and a development agency who is designing and
developing from scratch in India to be catered to the Indian Army as
well as to as a defence export in the future.

I am not a not a liberty do discuss more details as it involves national
Security, So I would like to leave that part out.

In general we are a modern Warfare company our core offering will be
aligned towards asymmetrical warfare capable enough take on the enemy in
a urban combat environment.

We have just started working on the core components and we should be in
a position to deliver the end users before end of this year.

Where do you design and develop? Does government agency for example DRDO
facilitate and guide you when you have certain projects in your hand,
and you want to develop it further-- you want to test further on that?
Could you talk about such challenges?

We are in the initial phase, where we design and develop in house at our
office here and London.

We are a manufacturing defense equipment's testing is only allowed in
the testing centres authorised by DGQA and we will be testing it there.

We have not approached DRDO yet, and we are figuring out on how to work
with them.

The major challenge is designing and developing a product which will be
relevant for another 15 years to come and does not affect the
operational capability of the end user.

We have developed a robust process and stringent procedures in terms of
testing our products based on the international guidelines which is
critical to our promise as brand.

How can a start-up can scale up, reach out to global markets, assimilate
technology and collaborate with international partners? How do you see
your company going that direction and scaling up?

When it comes to scaling up, it is always a chicken and egg story. We
have to figure out a way to overcome this challenge. I will definitely
not complain about it because, I have slept peacefully for so many years
knowing our forces are having sleepless night protecting me and my
family and this is our time to give it back to them in a small way by
having couple of years of sleepless nights.

For a start-up, funding is always a problem. So it alone cannot deter a
start-up from doing anything, will figure a way out it in the right way.

Currently, with respect to exports, we are looking at the idea scheme by
government of India, where government of India extends its line of
credit to other friendly foreign nations, where we can export our
products until we get a concrete order for the Indian Army.

The only problem right now when it comes to defence exports is that the
confidence level of foreign partners who wish to buy indian products is
low because we don't have indigenous battle proven products unlike our
previous suppliers like Russia, America and others, who have an existing
platform and products that are tested on the battlefield over a period
of time.

So building the confidence over a period of time is a key to success in
this endeavour, in respect to hand holding the government is doing their
level best and we should really appreciate them for being so proactive,
having said that there is a lot of gaps in terms of policy to execution.

Let us say for an instance there should be an online portal for friendly
nations to apply and a single window mechanism to procure from the
Indian entity combining foreign consulates, Ministry of external
affairs, bank and other related stakeholders to communicate and obtain
faster results.

This is the burning question. How can MSME be a greater part of our
defence ecosystem, how can they scale up? How can they be innovative and
be part of the solution? What do you expect from government to support
you?

MSMEs are not start-ups because an MSME has a existing business and will
see these products as an add-on opportunity to their existing business
but a start-up is a problem solver who is betting his entire livelihood
on this problem that the armed forces wanted to be solved and his
commitment level will be very high towards solving it because the logic
is very simple, he doesn't have a second job or other businesses to
support his family. Until proven and procured the world will see him as
loser with unrealistic expectations which has a profound effect on his
family, friends and well-wishers who hoped one day success.

In general, most of the start-ups come from a working class background
where their families are either working, self employed max in trading
business. To digest the fact that someone is getting into Defense will
give an impression of a mad guy.

Let me give you an example, somebody asks your family about you what do
you do for your living, they would say " he is basically a journalist
and currently working as an editor in business world" and imagine a
start-up like me and someone asks about me to my family, what should
they say " He is designing a state of art Missile System in his home
office" and world around him will call him irresponsible because, he is
not earning to support his family and being selfish running behind a
wild fantasy of protecting the protectors.

Today, we start-ups are always seen as a Insignificant entity with huge
aspirations who is on a MAD trip without M-money, A- Authority over
defense subject and D - Direction, but our only strength is that our
determination to Make a difference when the whole world around us is
against our madness.

All we start-ups have is the will to fight and nothing less to offer and
hope everyday that day of acceptance and financial independence will
soon come so that my friends and family can walk with their shoulders
held high because their assessment about us was right or else there is
another day of failure and hoping for success cycle continues.

MSME's on the other hand is very vital to this self reliance but will
need a start-up or a OEM to absorb them into the supply chain and
because of necessity and not by choice, because no one company can
produce all the components by themselves, due to lot of constraints.

Most important gap where, I feel government should step in creating a
bridge capital system like TREDS because this will not allow merger and
acquisition of the small companies by foreign giants which happens a lot
even in established Military Industrial complexes such as USA, where
good technology developed will be purchased by a bigger player on a
later date and whole purpose of Aatma Nirbhar will get defeated.

The major challenge is the working capital for any start-up, because
this is not a B2B or B2C business but a B2G business where you do not
have a market outside this sphere to convince anyone to invest in us
without any collateral nor a proof of concept to prove their offerings
will work. .

The initial Project Sanction orders are issued based on no commitment,
no cost basis where the question is not about borrowing but how to repay
it back with interest when we fail is a big question mark which I don't
think anyone is having answers for this question.

I personally feel that defense companies who are issued project sanction
orders should be allowed for a TREDS (Trade Receivables and a
Discounting system) linking a Credit guarantee scheme like CTG-MSE to
get working capital as an overdraft online with a dedicated branch
dealing with ministry of defence.

Let me explain why I think, this is important?

We have to understand the fundamental of a bank, where the repayment
capacity is the only primary criteria where the banking system allows
them to lend money and why will any banker will have a Non performing
Asset where everyone knows that probability of a start-up failure is
more than 50% and who do not have a definitive repayment deadline nor a
credit history to support the case.

Secondly, most of the bankers feel that National security or being self
reliant in defending the nation is Indian Ministry of Defence problem
and not theirs.

Thirdly, Defense Industry is a capital intensive business where there
are so many regulatory compliances to be fulfilled before commencement
of business and the funds required post winning the tender becomes
humungous, the only option left is going to an equity investor and most
often have someone on board who will not allow us to execute what is
right for the end user but what is right for their investment.

Start-ups will end up as an entity who started with a definitive purpose
of protecting the protectors but landed up being something else where
protecting the investment and shareholders interests only.

so having access to TREDS allows companies to get the funds on time at a
reasonable rates without disturbing the execution of the project

Start-ups: Art, not science

For sale: Small Mideast country. Troubled neighborhood – but highly
creative entrepreneurs. Serious buyers.

ISRAEL IS not for sale. But if it were, we now know what Israel is
worth, thanks to a study by the World Bank and the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange. If shares in Israel Inc.

were floated on the stock exchange, they would be worth 17.6 trillion
shekels (4.8 trillion dollars), claim the experts.

If a buyer acquired Israel, he or she would own Israel's annual 350
billion dollar GDP.

This implies a modest annual rate of return on investment of about 7
percent. Keep in mind the substantial risk premium.

Just to put things in proportion, on Thursday, August 2, Apple shares
closed at a record high of $207.39, bringing Apple's market value to
just over 1 trillion dollars, a historical first for a single company.
Hence, all of Israel is worth just a bit less than five (Macintosh)
Apples.

Apple employs 123,000 people. Israel's labor force is four million. So
each Apple worker generates 6.8 times more wealth than each Israeli
worker.

Apart from my deplorable addiction to numbers, burned into all
economists' DNA, there is a point to these numbers.

Israel brands itself as the Start-up Nation, ever since Dan Senor and
Saul Singer's blockbuster 2011 book by that name. The website they
launched, Start-up Nation Central, acts as matchmaker, linking foreign
investors and companies with some 5,500 Israeli start-ups. And according
to Bloomberg, this is the highest number of start-ups per capita in the
world.

The Amazon promo for "Start-up Nation" asks rhetorically, "How is it
that Israel – a country of 7.1 million [now 8.5 million], only 60 years
old [now 70], surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since
its founding, with no natural resources, [OK, we have natural gas now] –
produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable
nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada and the UK?" Start-up
Nation Central analyst Rinat Korbet has written an upbeat analysis of
Israel's high-tech industry. "The first six months of 2018 were
characterized by global record-breaking venture capital deal values,"
she wrote. "…The Israeli high-tech industry is both growing in the
amount of money raised by its tech startups, and maturing (a growing
layer of maturing companies). It is enjoying the fruits of previous
successes and innovations, the knowledge accumulated by serial
entrepreneurs and multinationals based in Israel, also the continuous
flow of capital from abroad."

Let me put these glowing words and numbers into perspective. Small
nations like Israel focus on quality, not quantity. It is the quality of
our start-ups that matter, not the quantity. Look at what one Apple, one
Teva, one Check Point, or one Mobileye can contribute.

Measured by quality, Israel's start-ups are far from world-beaters. Only
4 percent achieve profitability and sustained independent growth,
according to the Israel Venture Center. Measured by successful start-ups
per capita, Israel is somewhat of a bust.

But why? Why do so many start-ups fail? Is it baked into the cake? Some
think so.

After I published an opinion piece in the business daily TheMarker
bemoaning the astronomical start-up failure rate, renowned patent lawyer
Dr. Esther Luzatto berated me in response, in print. She argued that
"the fact that so few start-ups reach maturity is inherent in the global
technology game. The fact is, private money – the litmus test of the
technological system – is invested in start-ups, even in those likely to
close. The venture capital model knows how to take into account success
and failure."

In other words, if smart money invests in start-ups, despite the odds,
why fix something that isn't broken? But I am unconvinced. After several
decades as an educator at MIT and the Technion, teaching creativity and
innovation, and lately, after some research, I believe I now know in
part why such a high proportion of Israeli start-ups fail.

Most start-ups are driven by engineering, science and technology. And
most entrepreneurs are engineers or scientists. But entrepreneurship is
an art, not a science. Former Apple guru Guy Kawasaki observed that
"entrepreneurship is a state of mind, not a job definition." And the
state of mind is that of an artist.

Suppose we decide that for entrepreneurs, quality, not quantity, of
start-ups is the objective – the fraction that succeed, become
profitable and achieve sustained growth. How can the quality of Israel's
start-ups – their business design, strategy, and hard-headed management
focus – be improved? Technology-driven entrepreneurs emerge largely from
science and technology universities and faculties. This is the core of
the problem. The art of entrepreneurship emerges, like a butterfly, from
the cocoon of science and technology, an inherent mismatch.

And partly for that reason, most start-up butterflies never fly.

Science is the study of the physical and natural world and the laws that
govern it.

Technology is the application of science for practical purposes. And
entrepreneurship? It is the art of applying creative skill and
imagination to technology, in order to create value, for thousands or
millions.

Science seeks to discover the basic rules of nature. Entrepreneurs seek
to intelligently break the rules, to create innovative, useful products
and services.

Kawasaki is the marketing guru who helped Apple and Steve Jobs make the
Macintosh computer a huge hit. He later wrote a book, "The Art of the
Start," now updated as "The Art of the Start 2.0." It is one of the best
and most practical books on how to launch a successful start-up.

The title explains itself. Science follows the rigid scientific method.
Art tries to make things, and do things, differently from everyone else.
If your innovation is not ten times, fifty times better than what
exists, and totally unique, Kawasaki counsels, then forget it.

Consider Pablo Picasso. For over 70 years, he repeatedly smashed the
rules of painting and sculpture. Picasso invented constructed sculpture
and co-invented the collage art style. Both broke the rules. His works
thrill us not because they followed the rules of art but because they
annihilated them.

"If you know what you are going to do," Picasso once said, "why bother
doing it?" This is utterly contrary to the MBA approach to management,
which lays down rigid rules, the right way.

A study led by my Neaman Institute colleague Prof. Arnon Bentur and his
team on the future of engineering education found that graduates of
engineering universities lack key 'soft' skills, such as teamwork and
communicating, according to industry experts who employ them. They
recommend a shift to project-based learning, which simulates the way
engineers (and artists) work in the real world.

My Neaman Institute colleagues Tsipy Buchnik, Vered Segal and I just
published a study of Technion graduates who later launched start-ups, in
the Journal of Entrepreneurship Education. Technion entrepreneurs
reported that the Technion activities that proved most helpful to them
by far were the experiential simulations – hackathons, three-day
start-ups, and the yearlong Biztech competition, in which teams of
participants ideate and build businesses around those ideas.

This is because the way artists learn their craft is by practicing it,
in a studio setting.

For instance, at Jerusalem's famed Bezalel Academy, 2,000 art students
hone their creative skills in design studios, under experienced mentors.

Perhaps the way budding entrepreneurs can best hone their craft is in a
studio setting – by doing it, first in dry simulations and perhaps
later, in 'wet' (real) ones. Isn't this why the IDF 8200 Military
Intelligence unit spawns so many successful start-ups? Its graduates
practice the Art of the Start in the unit, by leading projects they have
dreamed up. When they finish their tour of duty and actually launch a
start-up, they've already practiced the art several times and have
expertise. This is how Check Point was born, in 1993. Founders Gil
Schwed, Marius Nacht and Shlomo Kramer were already seasoned IDF
entrepreneurs before they launched it.

If building a successful start-up is an art, then it should be learned
and taught as an art. This simple axiom must be more widely embraced in
Israel's science and technology institutions. If it is, a higher
proportion of start-ups will succeed. And quality will triumph over
quantity.

Basic skills of entrepreneurship should be taught in engineering
schools| Here's why

The work dynamics have changed drastically in the past couple of
decades. Presently, securing a high-paying job was considered a mark of
success, post-completion of an engineering degree. The new trend of
success would be to hone their passion towards innovative product
development and become a globally renowned entrepreneur. Is the
education system ready to cater this demand of the student?

The NEP 2020 offers a lot of flexibilities in terms of multi entry multi
exit, tailor made programs, dual degree, multidisciplinary courses. It
is the responsibility of the education institutes to properly utilise
these flexibilities to transform the innovation to enterprise. They
should also ensure to enable the degree to aid the innovation rather
than making it as a burden. This would certainly the best contribution
by education system for self-reliant India. REASONS WHY TEACHING THESE
SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT: TOP-NOTCH ENTREPRENEURS IN THE WORLD REALISED
THEIR POTENTIAL AT AN AVERAGE AGE OF 20 It is a fact that most
successful entrepreneurs begin early on their journey towards
establishing a successful Start-up. Thereby it's essential to trigger
innovation during freshman or sophomore years of engineering. Courses
like Design thinking and innovation can be floated with
multidisciplinary constitution to identify and dig out the hidden
innovative talent. MOST INTELLECT AT THAT AGE IN INDIA WOULD BE PURSUING
ENGINEERING The bulk of the students in India pursue engineering as
under graduation. It is the responsibility of the engineering schools to
develop job provider than jobseekers. This would curtail the employment
problem in due course of time. ENGINEERING EDUCATION HAS BECOME AN
ENABLER FOR GLOBAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES Engineering as a degree is
multidimensional and offers great knowledge and insight into the
practicality of various phenomena. This is the reason, it is considered
a benchmark for global business and job opportunities. The job
opportunities are lucrative and educational loans will be haunting to
give up innovation. It is the role of educational institute to provide
proper ecosystem to enable the start-up to take early traction and
generate revenues. Confidence should be given to student that recruiters
value more the students with start-up experience than others for higher
packages. The experience that they gain from the failures of start-up
are impeccable and cannot be provided by any company as a part of
training. Transferable Skills Design Thinking

-   Critical Thinking

1.  Logical Thinking

1.  Innovation Management

1.  Project Management

1.  People Management

1.  Networking 

1.  Finance management

1.  Communication (LSRW)

Will make them prepared for career option in their life, even they fail
in their start-up.

TIME TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING OWN PRODUCTS/SOLUTIONS/SERVICES The degree
years provide the best opportunity for a student to focus on developing
their own products/solutions/services. When it is coupled with learning
entrepreneurial skills, it does great wonders for the student. INDIAN
STUDENTS REMAIN IGNORANT ABOUT THEIR IMMENSE ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS
Despite having a great business community, Indian students in general
are alien to the various tricks of the common trade. The optimising
algorithms that run their brain to work with limited resources, the easy
way of getting things done, the multicultural brought up. All these
skills would naturally prepare them for the business world, right after
their childhood. But because of the conservative mind-set of parents and
institutes the talent remain unexplored. ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
PROGRAMS GO HAND-IN-HAND A student needs both engineering and management
skills to become a successful entrepreneur.But most of the educational
institutes offer these programs in silos. Hence, they institute to
ensure to offer open electives related to innovation management, finance
management, marketing, product development etc. To imbibe managerial
skills into engineering.Several educational institutes and universities
have introduced hybrid programs in the form of minors, dual degrees
aiming to provide knowledge of both engineering and management,
simultaneously. This is just a step forward in direction of preparing
future entrepreneurs. PROJECTS RUN ONLY TO MEET ACADEMIC RESEARCH
REQUIREMENTS AND USER REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED It is a common
scenario that projects are generally taken up from research
papers/articles. But for successful entrepreneur conducting field study
to understand user requirements and developing a project statement is
the key for innovation. Hence, courses like design thinking, social
internship are to be offered by inclusion of field study. Check list for
the basic 'must have' Entrepreneurial skill-set

-   Problem-solving ability

1.  Financial management capability

1.  Leadership qualities

1.  Product development skill

1.  Organisational skills

1.  Communication and networking

Apart from the above pointers, the student needs to develop empathy for
the problems that exist in the business world as these problems are gold
mines of opportunities. Multidisciplinary courses, field studies,
mentors, idea labs and start-up semester are the key enablers that bring
out the best in a student in terms of an entrepreneur. Also, nowadays,
there is vast support from the Government of India for budding
entrepreneurs, in terms of incubation centres, Smart India Hackathons,
idea labs, funding schemes, and much more. A proper design of Academic
curriculum with appropriate usage of Academic flexibilities provided by
NEP 2020 will the right source to dig out the hidden entrepreneurs
amongst the rich human resource of engineering students.

Over 1 lakh jobs at risk, 10K startups face payroll failure: Y
Combinator CEO

Kashmir Monitor (India)

March 12, 2023 Sunday

Copyright 2023 The Kashmir Monitor All Rights Reserved

Length: 440 words

Dateline: Srinagar

Body

Srinagar, March 12 -- New Delhi, March 12 () US-based technology startup
accelerator Y Combinator, which has invested in thousands of startups,
including at least 200 from India, has written a petition to US Treasury
Secretary Janet Yellen and others, asking them to prevent further
shockwaves that could lead to financial crisis and layoffs of more than
100,000 workers.

Over 1,200 CEOs and founders representing over 56,000 employees have
already signed the petition, written by Garry Tan, CEO and President of
Y Combinator, to save startups and hundreds of thousands of jobs.

"We ask for relief and attention to an immediate critical impact on
small businesses, startups, and their employees who are depositors at
the bank," read the petition.

According to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), Silicon
Valley Bank has over 37,000 small businesses with more than $250,000 in
deposits.

"These balances are now unavailable to them, and without further
intervention, according to the FDIC website, may be inaccessible for
months to years," the petition further said.

In the Y Combinator community, one-third of startups with exposure to
SVB used SVB as their sole bank account.

"As a result, they will fail to have the cash to run payroll in the next
30 days. By that measure, we can estimate that payroll-related furlough
or shutdown will impact more than 10,000 small businesses and startups,"
Tan wrote.

If the average small business or startup employs 10 workers, this will
have an immediate effect of furlough, layoff, or shutdown, affecting
over 100,000 jobs in the most vibrant sector of innovation in our
economy, he lamented.

Silicon Valley Bank's failure has a real risk of systemic contagion. Its
collapse has already instilled fear among founders and management teams
to look for safer havens for their remaining cash, which can trigger a
bank run on every other smaller bank.

He asked regulators that small business depositors at Silicon Valley
Bank should be made whole.

"Regulators need to conduct a backstop of depositors. We are not asking
for a bank bailout. Congress should work to restore stronger regulatory
oversight and capital requirements for regional banks, and any
malfeasance or mismanagement on the part of SVB executives leading to
this failure should be investigated," Tan elaborated.

Start-up: Converting ideas into actions

The Hitavada

June 17, 2018 Sunday

Body

In June 2009, two former employees Of Yahoo! grabbed the eyeballs of 1.5
billion people through an idea that changed the whole tradition of
formal SMS text messaging by creating WhatsApp. The small idea created a
huge impact on the world which changed the way world looked at the
start-ups.

The young generation today, prefers to convert ideas into actions. And
then to turn these actions into a productive consumer-based need
product.

Start-ups are just these ideas, in which Thousands of young members of
society are investing their time and money rather than choose a secured
job. The youth is not only opting for these Different options but also
turning them into reality by developing different ideas and introducing
new ventures in the business world. One such idea to bring musicians
together around Nagpur is Co-cerato.

CEO, Vivarth Sine Vave felt the need to weave musicians together when he
met Sanket Gomase, co-founder of Co-coreato and discovered the
importance of collaboration in music industry.

"Let's create magic together" was the one thought which the young
businessmen decided to work on. "Passion for music and understanding the
role of association was base of Co-creato.

Different schemes of the Government for young entrepreneurs and courses
added to the passion for music and to bring the magic on stage," says
the young co-founder, Vivarth. "Money is just an idea (Rich Dad Poor
Dad) inspired a 15-year-old boy to walk Toward sent repreneurship,
working on Something which you yourself have created gives immense
pleasure," says Harshit Soni, founder of Smile Middle, a website which
lets artists sell their created portraits in different art styles. "The
idea was to exchange a skill which one is not good at and another is.
The website was formed to connect the ones who have skill and others who
don't," added Harshit.

Passion and inspiration became the reason for some while interest for
the other led to ideas turn into action. One such start-up is Pocket
savvy.

"My keen interest in marketing led the creation of the Pocket Savey. The
idea to formalise the act of providing discounts to consumers and best
customer service is the base of the startup. Our current vision is not
to build a billion dollar company but to develop a system like it," say
the young entrepreneurs Piyush Sharma and Chaman Mamtani.

Being a successful investor and cofounder of Nagpur Angles, Shashikant
Chaudhary says, "The team work is the most important ingredient in the
recipe of start-up as 95 per cent of the success is not about the idea
but the execution. It is all about surviving in the least favourable
circumstances with extremely limited resources." Adding to this, founder
of Lambent Technologies, Shashikant said that Different and innovative
solution is also one of the major condition for a startup to come
forward in the race.

Explaining about the high rate of failure in start-up industry,
Shashikant Chaudhary said that during the premature skilling many
start-ups tend burst as unit economy-difference of rate at which
consumer is acquired and cost of the product, is not finely tuned.
Adding to this he said, "Important factors like time and money, is not
properly evaluated by the young minds due to which they face value of
debt and is one of the major reason for failure of a start-up. And the
most important for start-ups to climb first step is planning road map
which includes provisioning of market budget for example major part of
the budget should be allocated for marketing. Understanding, the need
and proper utilisation should be planned."

When asked about preference of youths towards start-up, he said "Due
advent of technology and access to it at affordable rates, cost of
innovation has been reduced. So, any two or three people sitting in a
room working together with least capital but with a right solution can
create a beautiful solution to a problem."

Further, in this techno-savvy world due to combination the new

Mumbai: The internet has boosted the startup scene all over the world,
including India. Many homegrown startups have not only attracted a good
customer base but are seeing investors of all sizes plug their money at
different stages of the startups' expansion in their respective markets.

Here's why the startup space is a priority asset class for most domestic
investors in the modern era.

Investing capital for increased returns is critical in everyone's life,
especially after the covid-19 pandemic loomed uncertainty by rocking the
global financial markets. As the investment sphere is heavily
sentiment-driven, the massive job losses, slashed incomes, and irregular
business cash flows led to the crash of indices on the back of arrested
investments and demand for liquid funds.

The investment sphere is slowly regaining traction on the green side as
we steadily put behind the adverse effects of the pandemic. In these
times, the hot topic for most has been investment in the startup space.
As India builds its way toward increased adoption of digitisation, most
startups in the digital sphere have thrived as their investors and
customer base are all here on the internet, irrespective of their
physical presence.

So, why are so many startups in India succeeding in attracting investors
of all types at various stages of their funding requirements?

High Reward Potential - With a small capital fund investment, the
returns can be subsequently 2x-10x basis of the scale at which the
startup is attracting customers. Though they are high-risk assets, an
investment in a startup can be highly rewarding. Take for instance
Google which was a startup once and led its path to go public and raise
$500 million for early-stage investors. A whopping return on investment
is what startups are known for among investors.

Change-maker - Most startups have principles that state how the firm
strives to bring about an adaptable change in society, leading to the
betterment of the environment and promoting sustainability. See, for
instance, how most startups have been operating digitally instead of
with brick-and-mortar stores, which subsequently reduces their carbon
footprint. They regularly measure and report about their emissions and
the means to bring them down through their learning.

Side hustle - As the invested capital keeps giving good returns, most
investors invest in this space to use the generated profits to meet
their operational costs. As a result, for many investors, investing in
startups is a side hustle.

Gain market recognition - Being a part of the start-ups' journey, as an
investor, you get the chance to meet several industry veterans who are
likewise investors, board members of the company, or just meet several
industry experts at many forums where all of them come together. As an
investor, you stand a chance for increased recognition in the market.

Early investing - Saving from shelling out more capital for a larger
share of the startup, early-stage investing often helps the investor
reap better and higher returns when the start-up starts to thrive. One
must be mindful of the amount of investment in any startup, while also
being mindful that the model is subject to failure.

Diversifying your portfolio - As many investors park their capital in
stocks and share markets, in a bid not to fall prey to the market
volatility risk with their investment every time, they can consider
investing in a startup. While a startup is too subject to market risk
due to demand-supply fluctuations, etc., they are not as sensitive and
are affected daily by the shift in market dynamics. They are focused
more on targeted sectors, so the risk of fluctuation in the investment
is lesser. It thereby diversifies one's investment portfolio. Invest in
10 different start-ups in 10 varied categories for a dynamic
understanding and diversification of your portfolio.

High potential for buy-outs - A startup, on the back of its high
performance and high returns can be subject to be acquired by any of the
investors eyeing to take control of the operations. Offering fair
compensation for the acquisition, as an investor, one can potentially
see the brighter side of capital gain with the buy-out of the startup/s
that they have invested their money in.

While it cannot be denied that startups are subject to failure and
there's a risk of your investment getting razed altogether, there's risk
in your investment in the stock and share markets, real estate assets,
gold, and other bonds. Why not put your hands in and get a first-person
experience of how investing in startups works?

SVB Collapse: Will It Impact The Ongoing Funding Glare?

Business World

March 15, 2023

With the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the United States,
there is widespread fear that the impact may result in a long financial
winter for Indian startups

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has sent shockwaves through the
financial and technology communities. The assets of the Santa Clara,
California-based bank were seized by US regulators on Friday after
depositors began withdrawing dollars in droves amid concerns about the
lender's financial health.

Since then, banking regulators around the world have worked feverishly
to mitigate the damage from SVB's failure, the largest bank failure in
the United States since 2008, and restore trust in the global financial
system.

As the name suggests, SVB's business was largely focused on technology
firms. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the banks saw an increase in
deposits as tech firms benefited from offering entertainment and
delivery services to those who were confined to their homes. SVB put a
large portion of this money into US government bonds, which are
traditionally one of the safest sorts of investments.

SVB's problems began last year, when the US Federal Reserve began hiking
interest rates in response to rising inflation, leading the value of
those bonds to decline. "Rising interest rates in the US and a slowdown
in startup funding in 2023 created a liquidity crunch for SVB much
before the large-scale bank withdrawals happened. SVB invested in
long-term, low-interest-bearing bonds in an almost zero-interest-rate
market. However, as interest rates started increasing, their value
started falling. These bonds are held-to-maturity instruments and unlike
other instruments, aren't marked to market, which means SVB could have
possibly held them on their balance sheet without the need to reprice
them and remained solvent," said, Ashish Fafadia, Partner at Blume
Ventures.

As the tech sector's economic prospects deteriorated following the
epidemic boom, many of SVB's customers began to tap on their cash to
stay afloat. SVB was obliged to sell its bonds at a large loss due to a
lack of cash, raising concerns about its financial health.

Several depositors, concerned about the safety of their deposits as a
result of social media information, made massive withdrawals within 24
to 36 hours. This exacerbated SVB's cash problems and caused insolvency.

Elaborating on the macroeconomic factors that led to the collapse,
Oliver Heinrich, Partner at Picus Capital, told BW Businessworld, "When
it became public that SVB needed an equity infusion to cover holes in
its balance sheet that arose from selling bonds below their face value,
the stability of the bank was questioned, in turn leading to a bank run
as depositors did not want to see their balances lost."

Bank transfers used to take 2 to 3 days and required a trip to a bank
branch. As a result, even if a significant number of depositors wished
to withdraw money at the same time, banks had a channel of communication
with them, such as sending out statements through the media to reassure
them that their money was safe. In this case, however, SVB was unable to
keep up with the quick flow of information via social media and had
little time to engage with its depositors before to its eventual
collapse.

There have been speculations about more banks facing struggles in the
near future. Therefore, startups should be ready for the worst of the
situation and ensure that they invest their money in more reliable
alternatives.

"Companies should diversify their exposure by having accounts with
different banks since the banking system does allow for bank failures
and deposits are only insured up to a certain amount. In addition, there
are low risk instruments in the money market that will ensure that
start-up funds are not part of the bank's balance sheet and would not
have been affected by a bank run. This is particularly important for
companies with large funding rounds, as simply diversifying will not be
feasible to ensure themselves sufficiently, since the deposit insurance
typically ranges between USD100,000 to USD250,000," Heinrich explained.

Experts have been speculating that, since last year, the loss of
valuation of tech companies, the large-scale layoffs in the tech and
startup sectors, and the shuttering of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature
Bank in the US are interrelated. " Founders should be careful if their
business model is over-indexed on a single point of failure. In this
instance, it was having just one bank account with SVB. However, there
could be other risks like having their business models aligned with a
Government policy or on the increase in prices of certain goods. This
makes them vulnerable to a future black swan event if there are any
changes in the macro environment that are difficult to predict. The
collapse of SVB and associated hardships should be the trigger to deeply
rethink de-risking business models and not just diversifying bank
accounts," Fafadia added.

Smartphone investors bet $200mn on making something out of Nothing

A consumer electronics start-up called Nothing has secured financing of
more than $200mn to launch its debut smartphone, in the first attempt
for several years by a newcomer to crack a market dominated by Apple and
Samsung.

Nothing will unveil the design of its first smartphone, called Phone
(1), on Wednesday before it goes on general sale this summer. The device
has a transparent back, revealing electronics components such as a
wireless charging coil that are normally hidden, and runs on the Android
operating system.

The company’s backers include Alphabet’s venture capital arm, EQT
Ventures and former Apple designer Tony Fadell. They are betting that
Carl Pei, Nothing’s chief executive, who previously co-founded Chinese
smartphone brand OnePlus, can succeed where even Andy Rubin, the
co-founder of the Android mobile operating system, failed.

Rubin’s start-up Essential raised $330mn but shut down in 2020 after its
2017 smartphone launch sold fewer than 100,000 units in its first six
months, according to estimates by research firm IDC at the time.

“I come from a very hardware-centric background and he comes from a very
software-centric background,” Pei said of Rubin in an interview with the
Financial Times. “People with more credibility than I have tried and
failed . . . They underestimated the complexity of this industry.”

After several years where most smartphones have come to resemble Apple’s
iPhone designs, Pei said, “people are yearning for something new”.

After the failure of start-ups such as Essential that attempted to offer
more novel designs, the smartphone market has become more concentrated.

According to market researchers Counterpoint, just four companies
accounted for almost three-quarters of the 1.4bn smartphones sold
globally last year.

Pei’s previous venture, OnePlus, is part of China-based BBK Electronics,
which has become the fourth-biggest smartphone player alongside Apple,
Samsung and Xiaomi, through a range of brands including Oppo, Vivo and
Realme.

That concentration has made launching a new handset even more difficult
in recent years, Pei admitted. Manufacturers are more reluctant to work
with newcomers after being burnt by low sales of earlier start-ups.
Obtaining components, many of which are already constrained across the
industry, is more challenging for new entrants with lower volumes.

Last year, Nothing initially ordered around 700,000 screens for its
first run of Phone (1) but has been able to increase that order after
raising more capital and building confidence among distributors with
last year’s launch of its first product, a pair of wireless earbuds that
sport the same transparent casing as its forthcoming phone. Nothing has
shipped 530,000 units of Ear (1) since the device went on general sale
last August.

That helped to “prove to the market that this team cannot only design a
really beautiful product, but can manufacture and sell it at scale”, Pei
said. “Using this proof point, we raised more money to be able to build
a smartphone. And if the smartphone subsequently does well we can raise
more money to do the next thing we want to do.”

Nothing has raised $144mn in equity funding and has a $65mn revolving
line of credit from its sales partners. The company is working with O2
in the UK, Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Flipkart in India to
distribute the phone when it launches, with ambitions to eventually
launch in the US if Phone (1) sells well.

With 330 staff, Nothing runs its supply chain and hardware from
Shenzhen, China, with design and marketing in Europe and other teams in
India, Taiwan and California. The intellectual property behind its
products is held in the UK.

“A lot of Android manufacturers are just taking market share from each
other and not doing anything very different to be able to even attempt
to take share from Apple,” Pei said. “I think the result of this product
is that we will be converting more iPhone users than other Android
phones.”

As for Essential, some of its ideas may be getting a second life with
Phone (1). Last year, Nothing acquired some of its intellectual property
assets.

Europe's start-up ecosystem: Heating up, but still facing challenges

McKinsey & Company

October 11, 2020 Sunday

Highlight: More ventures are achieving unicorn status, and at a faster
pace, but many more still aren't realizing their full potential. What's
holding them back, and what can change that?

Body

In recent years, Europe's start-up ecosystem has seen a surge in the
number of unicorns and the pace at which they are created. Of the 99
venture-capital-backed European unicorns, 14 were added in 2019 alone.
These include Germany's neobank N26, France's healthcare scheduling
service Doctolib, and Lithuania's online used-clothing marketplace
Vinted. Despite this accelerated activity, European start-ups still lag
in achieving successful late-stage outcomes when compared with other
start-up ecosystems.

About the authors

This article was a collaborative effort by Kim Baroudy, Jonatan Janmark,
Abhi Satyavarapu, Tobias Strålin, and Zeno Ziemke, representing views
from McKinsey's Technology, Media, and Telecommunications Practice.

To better understand the forces at work behind the outcomes of European
start-ups, we conducted a cohort analysis that examines Europe, India,
and the United States, using the latter as a benchmark for a healthy
start-up ecosystem (see sidebar, "About our analysis"). We also assessed
the trends and challenges affecting those ecosystems and interviewed
start-up founders and investors to add context to our findings. Though
our data is historical and conditions are definitely changing for the
better, our analysis of Europe's start-up ecosystem illustrates the
ongoing underlying issues that entrepreneurs face.

Sidebar

About our analysis

To assess the health of the start-up ecosystems in Europe, India, and
the United States, we conducted a cohort analysis. We viewed the US
start-up ecosystem as a benchmark; we included India because India's
start-up ecosystem, like Europe's, is also heating up significantly. For
each region, we sampled start-ups that raised a seed or angel round from
2009 to 2014, a timeframe that deliberately excludes younger start-ups
that haven't yet matured through the usual funding round timeline. This
allowed us to get a clear picture of outcomes. We tracked the
performance of this set of companies from the moment they raised seed
funding to the present day and noted performance from the seed round all
the way to either Series E or an exit such as an IPO, merger, or
acquisition. We defined "success" as reaching Series C or a favorable
exit. We also tracked the number of start-ups that didn't advance or
went out of business.

This cohort analysis enabled us to assess success and failure rates
between various rounds of funding, and compare, with a large enough
sample size, across regions. We recognize that this provides a
historical view-the European start-up ecosystem has developed
considerably over the last five years, as, for example, governments have
actively sought to promote entrepreneurship. Start-ups launched in
Europe during that time may have performed better than those included in
our analysis, but since they have not yet reached the maturity level
needed to objectively assess their outcomes, we omitted them from this
analysis.

A startling disparity

Although change is happening quickly, according to our analysis Europe's
start-ups are still fewer in number, raise less money, and have a lower
likelihood of success (which we defined as start-ups that reach Series C
funding, go public, or are acquired). While Europe generates 36 percent
of all formally funded start-ups, it creates only 14 percent of the
world's unicorns (Exhibit 1). Adjusted for population and GDP, the
number of seed-stage start-ups that Europe generates is only 40 percent
of that generated by the United States.

Exhibit

Link to Image

Historically, Europe's ecosystem has been less effective than that of
the United States at turning start-ups into late-stage successes. To
analyze the steps between the seed stage and success, we looked at
start-ups that received seed or angel funding between 2009 and 2014. For
example, European start-ups were 30 percent less likely to progress from
seed to a successful outcome (also defined as securing Series C funding
or beyond, going public, or being sold), as compared to start-ups that
raised seed funding during that time in the United States (Exhibit 2).

Exhibit

Link to Image

Further, European start-ups have consistently lower total success rates
and show less progress through all series rounds when compared to US and
Indian start-ups in aggregate (Exhibit 3). For instance, for the cohort
of start-ups raising seed or angel funding between 2009 and 2014, the US
and Indian ecosystems are almost twice as effective as Europe's at
moving start-ups from Series C to Series D funding rounds, or even
Series B through Series C. For the same cohort, European start-ups
experience lower success rates than those in the United States
progressing through subsequent funding rounds.

Exhibit

Link to Image

Being less successful at progressing through this funnel, however,
doesn't mean that Europe's start-ups are outright failures. In fact, as
measured by bankruptcy rates across rounds, European companies don't
fail more often than US companies (Exhibit 4). Rather, European
companies are more likely to stall after a fundraising round, meaning
they simply don't advance to the next stage of funding or don't manage a
successful exit in the form of an IPO or some sort of acquisition. This
happens to 10 percent more European start-ups than US start-ups after
securing series A funding. While these companies may actually be growing
and profitable, and thus self-funding, they could be sacrificing further
growth potential. This effect may dampen the appetites of venture
capitalists (VCs), for whom operating at a profit is not enough-as they
tend to rely on big sales or IPOs to get high returns on their
investments.

What holds Europe's start-ups back?

These striking numbers highlight the key challenges that work in concert
to create drag on European start-ups. Five in particular have the
greatest effect on nascent companies.

The domestic value pool is fragmented. At the most basic level, the fact
that Europe is not a single market has profound effects on what
start-ups must focus on in their early years. Europe may have lowered
its borders and opened its markets, but it is still a collection of
dozens of different countries with their own languages, cultures, and
governments. For example, customer behaviors vary between countries,
which can require brands to be rebuilt for individual markets.
Distribution and marketing channels can be similarly challenging. Even
accommodating languages and payment methods alone requires a greater
investment of developer time than would usually be required of a
start-up in the United States, for example. Further complicating matters
is Europe's regulatory landscape, which, though being streamlined, is
both stricter and more fragmented than that of the United States.
Depending on the industry and vertical, regulations also have wide
variability.

Yet internationalization is unavoidable for Europe's start-ups-to
achieve valuations typical of US start-ups, European companies must
expand quickly and early across many countries. For a European start-up
to address a market that is similar in size to that of the United
States, it would need to enter 28 heterogeneous countries (Exhibit 5).

Exhibit

Link to Image

The limitations of the domestic value pool, and what start-ups have to
do to compensate for them, are also reflected in the geographical
footprint of unicorn companies. Our analysis of start-up website traffic
shows that about 70 percent of European unicorns had to establish a
global or partly global geographical footprint to reach unicorn stage,
as compared with just 50 percent of US unicorns.

Our data show that most European unicorns have had to expand not just
beyond their individual countries but beyond Europe as well, whereas
only half of US unicorns have expanded outside the continental United
States. This means that European start-ups have to focus on wider
internationalization earlier in their journey than do US start-ups.

Large funding rounds can be challenging. Historically, it has been more
difficult for European companies to raise large funding rounds due to a
lower supply of late-stage capital. As a result, it is harder for those
companies to compete with significantly better-funded US competitors. We
found that the problem was especially pronounced in the Series D and E
stages (Exhibit 6). In our interviews with industry insiders, this
difference was partially attributed to European investors' risk
aversion.

Exhibit

Link to Image

In recent years, as US funds have expanded their presence in Europe,
European VCs have raised more money, and more private-equity funds have
begun European growth-equity investing arms, European founders of
leading start-ups report that they have more access to late-stage
capital from global and local investors. Still, US businesses in
comparable industries, with similar success metrics, are able to raise
funding at significantly higher valuations than their European
counterparts. One factor that could account for Europe's historically
lower supply of late-stage capital is the mix of funding sources: the
biggest funders of European VCs tend to be governments and corporate
investors, which have a different set of interests and goals from the
biggest funders, such as large retirement and pension funds, of US VCs
(Exhibit 7).

Exhibit

Link to Image

However, as Europe's venture capital ecosystem matures and catches up to
that of the United States, which has had several more decades to evolve
since its emergence in the second half of the 20th century, the funding
proportions are starting to change. As VC returns have gained additional
momentum in recent years, pension-fund investments in Europe have
significantly increased: 2.3 times more pension funds were committed to
European venture capital in 2018 compared with the four previous years.
In 2019, capital invested in rounds of $100 million and more in Europe
was four times that of 2014. The continent also saw an increase in
megafunding rounds of $100 million and more, and even six $500
million-plus rounds, in 2019.

Despite such signs of progress, founders and funders told us in
interviews that the relative gap in ease of raising large funding rounds
has not yet fully closed, making it more difficult for European
start-ups to compete with significantly better-funded US competitors and
to become leading global players.

These issues can make European start-ups more inclined to limit risk
when pursuing exit strategies, including by spending too little on
expansion. In some cases, rapidly growing European start-ups may have
factored concerns about their abilities to raise large amounts of
follow-up capital into the decision to be acquired by US competitors
instead of trying to become global players on their own. For example,
the German collective-buying platform CityDeal was acquired by Groupon
after just six months in operation, and the Swedish payments company
iZettle had been preparing for an IPO when it sold to PayPal. Of course,
every case has its particulars, but for the highly profitable Finnish
mobile-gaming company Supercell Oy, the founders stated clearly that
they sold a majority stake to foreign investors (first SoftBank and
GungHo Online Entertainment, and now Tencent) because they felt a
"responsibility to pay out venture investors sooner rather than later."
These concerns can lead to missed opportunities: The former CEO of
Booking.com, the Dutch hotel reservation company that sold to Priceline
in 2005, has said that had other options been available at the time,
they might have held out longer for a next funding round. Today
Booking.com generates an estimated 80 percent of Priceline's revenue.

Cultural values play a role. European start-ups face much greater
pressure to perform, and to do so earlier, than start-ups in the United
States, where having a failure in one's past is typically seen as a
badge of honor (or at least a rite of passage critical for gaining the
lessons needed to ultimately succeed). We heard these sentiments echoed
repeatedly in our interviews with founders and venture capitalists, and
sentiment analysis of media coverage has shown, for example, that only
about 17 percent of press coverage in Germany portrays entrepreneurship
in a positive light, as compared with 39 percent in the United States.

  European start-ups face much greater pressure to perform, and to do so
  earlier, than start-ups in the United States.

This lack of a "risk culture" in Europe can also drive some founders to
take other, more conservative approaches that sacrifice growth
potential. For example, they might narrow ambitions to merely building a
sustainable business and regional disruptor. This could partially be
driven by the stigmatization of start-up bankruptcy in several European
countries, incentivizing founders to be more risk-averse in pursuing
growth opportunities. This would put European start-ups at a stark
disadvantage to their US peers, which more often aim for global
dominance.

However, an increasing number of recent European success stories, such
as Delivery Hero, Auto1, or N26, that focused on hypergrowth at the
expense of short-term profitability, has shifted this culture. According
to our interviews with founders around Europe, such success stories
appear to be inspiring other European start-ups to follow a similar
path.

Attracting the best talent can be difficult. While Europe has a tech
talent cost advantage compared to the United States-salaries for
software developers are as much as 50 percent lower in Europe than those
in the San Francisco Bay Area or New York City-the continent's start-ups
often lack the tools to attract the best talent. Most notably, in many
European countries unfavorable equity and stock-option rules make
start-ups less appealing to potential employees. For example, more than
75 percent of the EU countries' stock-option rules analyzed by the
European VC firm Index Ventures lagged behind those of the United
States.

At the same time, the significantly lower number of leading tech
companies and successful hypergrowth start-ups in Europe reduces the
pool of experienced executives and other talent that have hands-on
background in building IPO-sized companies. The type of operational
knowledge that comes from deep experience launching and exiting from
successful start-ups is key to scaling companies through the late
stages.

Innovation 'superhubs' are not as densely packed with resources as those
in the United States. "Superhubs" such as Silicon Valley and New York
City, which have a high concentration of entrepreneurs, tech talent, and
investors, have played a very important role in the success of the US
start-up ecosystem. Although London, Paris, Berlin, and Stockholm can be
considered the leading hubs in Europe, they have not achieved the same
concentration in terms of capital, knowledge, and talent. As a result,
only about 30 percent of European start-ups have located their
headquarters in a tech superhub-where they might have an easier time
attracting talent and funding-versus almost half of US start-ups
(Exhibit 8). Furthermore, surveys show that more than 60 percent of
founders start their companies where they live or where they have family
and support systems. Of course, relocating within the United States is
not the same as relocating within Europe, given that in the United
States the language and culture will generally be the same. However, if
COVID-19 means that working remotely or from home becomes more common,
this disparity might become less problematic and potentially could
lessen the importance of superhubs.

Even though conditions are improving, the challenges facing Europe's
start-up ecosystem remain significant. To overcome them, there are three
key areas in particular to consider. The first among these is
harmonization and active policy making. Europe could continue to
streamline its regulatory frameworks, which remain complex for start-ups
to navigate easily. Many European start-ups are seeking to expand
operations to multiple regions early on. Similarly, legal frameworks
could be reassessed to allow European start-ups to attract and retain
the necessary talent to build and scale new companies. Underpinning all
of this could be a vision that aims both to defend Europe's existing
strengths and to build and support areas of potential growth.

Second, leveraging Europe's assets, which include its public sector and
its relative strength in the B2B arena, is critical to growing the
start-up ecosystem. As large contractors, governments are key drivers
with the power to support innovation. Through this lever, Europe can
actively promote its start-up ecosystem. The B2B sectors offer
particularly fertile ground here, as the continent's entrepreneurs have
already established a solid foundation of innovation by digitizing the
activities that serve other businesses-and even more so now, as the
coronavirus crisis has created an expectation that more business will be
conducted digitally. Europe could also build on another relative
strength, sustainability, as the business opportunities around the
growing conversation of stakeholder responsibility continue to expand.
Europe is a leader in this area and is well positioned to capitalize on
this asset.

Third, Europe could look at how to support the culture and capital
needed to further grow its start-up ecosystem. Entrepreneurs could take
advantage of the improving conditions for start-ups to broaden their
ambitions and aim for global leadership. Governments could further this
through more risk-willing capital, and considering allocating more
semi-public funds toward growing the ecosystem, as well as fostering
collaboration between ventures, academia, and industry. It could also
prove beneficial to improve conditions for capital and funding-for
example, by leveraging European and global partnerships with aligned
incentives to allow them to scale faster.

number of unicorns and the pace at which they are created. Of the 99
venture-capital-backed European unicorns, 14 were added in 2019 alone.
These include Germany's neobank N26, France's healthcare scheduling
service Doctolib, and Lithuania's online used-clothing marketplace
Vinted. Despite this accelerated activity, European start-ups still lag
in achieving successful late-stage outcomes when compared with other
start-up ecosystems.

About the authors

This article was a collaborative effort by Kim Baroudy, Jonatan Janmark,
Abhi Satyavarapu, Tobias Strålin, and Zeno Ziemke, representing views
from McKinsey's Technology, Media, and Telecommunications Practice.

To better understand the forces at work behind the outcomes of European
start-ups, we conducted a cohort analysis that examines Europe, India,
and the United States, using the latter as a benchmark for a healthy
start-up ecosystem (see sidebar, "About our analysis"). We also assessed
the trends and challenges affecting those ecosystems and interviewed
start-up founders and investors to add context to our findings. Though
our data is historical and conditions are definitely changing for the
better, our analysis of Europe's start-up ecosystem illustrates the
ongoing underlying issues that entrepreneurs face.

About our analysis

To assess the health of the start-up ecosystems in Europe, India, and
the United States, we conducted a cohort analysis. We viewed the US
start-up ecosystem as a benchmark; we included India because India's
start-up ecosystem, like Europe's, is also heating up significantly. For
each region, we sampled start-ups that raised a seed or angel round from
2009 to 2014, a timeframe that deliberately excludes younger start-ups
that haven't yet matured through the usual funding round timeline. This
allowed us to get a clear picture of outcomes. We tracked the
performance of this set of companies from the moment they raised seed
funding to the present day and noted performance from the seed round all
the way to either Series E or an exit such as an IPO, merger, or
acquisition. We defined "success" as reaching Series C or a favorable
exit. We also tracked the number of start-ups that didn't advance or
went out of business.

This cohort analysis enabled us to assess success and failure rates
between various rounds of funding, and compare, with a large enough
sample size, across regions. We recognize that this provides a
historical view-the European start-up ecosystem has developed
considerably over the last five years, as, for example, governments have
actively sought to promote entrepreneurship. Start-ups launched in
Europe during that time may have performed better than those included in
our analysis, but since they have not yet reached the maturity level
needed to objectively assess their outcomes, we omitted them from this
analysis.

A startling disparity

Although change is happening quickly, according to our analysis Europe's
start-ups are still fewer in number, raise less money, and have a lower
likelihood of success (which we defined as start-ups that reach Series C
funding, go public, or are acquired). While Europe generates 36 percent
of all formally funded start-ups, it creates only 14 percent of the
world's unicorns (Exhibit 1). Adjusted for population and GDP, the
number of seed-stage start-ups that Europe generates is only 40 percent
of that generated by the United States.

Historically, Europe's ecosystem has been less effective than that of
the United States at turning start-ups into late-stage successes. To
analyze the steps between the seed stage and success, we looked at
start-ups that received seed or angel funding between 2009 and 2014. For
example, European start-ups were 30 percent less likely to progress from
seed to a successful outcome (also defined as securing Series C funding
or beyond, going public, or being sold), as compared to start-ups that
raised seed funding during that time in the United States (Exhibit 2).

Exhibit

Further, European start-ups have consistently lower total success rates
and show less progress through all series rounds when compared to US and
Indian start-ups in aggregate (Exhibit 3). For instance, for the cohort
of start-ups raising seed or angel funding between 2009 and 2014, the US
and Indian ecosystems are almost twice as effective as Europe's at
moving start-ups from Series C to Series D funding rounds, or even
Series B through Series C. For the same cohort, European start-ups
experience lower success rates than those in the United States
progressing through subsequent funding rounds.

Exhibit

Being less successful at progressing through this funnel, however,
doesn't mean that Europe's start-ups are outright failures. In fact, as
measured by bankruptcy rates across rounds, European companies don't
fail more often than US companies (Exhibit 4). Rather, European
companies are more likely to stall after a fundraising round, meaning
they simply don't advance to the next stage of funding or don't manage a
successful exit in the form of an IPO or some sort of acquisition. This
happens to 10 percent more European start-ups than US start-ups after
securing series A funding. While these companies may actually be growing
and profitable, and thus self-funding, they could be sacrificing further
growth potential. This effect may dampen the appetites of venture
capitalists (VCs), for whom operating at a profit is not enough-as they
tend to rely on big sales or IPOs to get high returns on their
investments.

What holds Europe's start-ups back?

These striking numbers highlight the key challenges that work in concert
to create drag on European start-ups. Five in particular have the
greatest effect on nascent companies.

The domestic value pool is fragmented. At the most basic level, the fact
that Europe is not a single market has profound effects on what
start-ups must focus on in their early years. Europe may have lowered
its borders and opened its markets, but it is still a collection of
dozens of different countries with their own languages, cultures, and
governments. For example, customer behaviors vary between countries,
which can require brands to be rebuilt for individual markets.
Distribution and marketing channels can be similarly challenging. Even
accommodating languages and payment methods alone requires a greater
investment of developer time than would usually be required of a
start-up in the United States, for example. Further complicating matters
is Europe's regulatory landscape, which, though being streamlined, is
both stricter and more fragmented than that of the United States.
Depending on the industry and vertical, regulations also have wide
variability.

Yet internationalization is unavoidable for Europe's start-ups-to
achieve valuations typical of US start-ups, European companies must
expand quickly and early across many countries. For a European start-up
to address a market that is similar in size to that of the United
States, it would need to enter 28 heterogeneous countries (Exhibit 5).

Exhibit

Link to Image

The limitations of the domestic value pool, and what start-ups have to
do to compensate for them, are also reflected in the geographical
footprint of unicorn companies. Our analysis of start-up website traffic
shows that about 70 percent of European unicorns had to establish a
global or partly global geographical footprint to reach unicorn stage,
as compared with just 50 percent of US unicorns.

Our data show that most European unicorns have had to expand not just
beyond their individual countries but beyond Europe as well, whereas
only half of US unicorns have expanded outside the continental United
States. This means that European start-ups have to focus on wider
internationalization earlier in their journey than do US start-ups.

Large funding rounds can be challenging. Historically, it has been more
difficult for European companies to raise large funding rounds due to a
lower supply of late-stage capital. As a result, it is harder for those
companies to compete with significantly better-funded US competitors. We
found that the problem was especially pronounced in the Series D and E
stages (Exhibit 6). In our interviews with industry insiders, this
difference was partially attributed to European investors' risk
aversion.

Exhibit

Link to Image

In recent years, as US funds have expanded their presence in Europe,
European VCs have raised more money, and more private-equity funds have
begun European growth-equity investing arms, European founders of
leading start-ups report that they have more access to late-stage
capital from global and local investors. Still, US businesses in
comparable industries, with similar success metrics, are able to raise
funding at significantly higher valuations than their European
counterparts. One factor that could account for Europe's historically
lower supply of late-stage capital is the mix of funding sources: the
biggest funders of European VCs tend to be governments and corporate
investors, which have a different set of interests and goals from the
biggest funders, such as large retirement and pension funds, of US VCs
(Exhibit 7).

Exhibit

Link to Image

However, as Europe's venture capital ecosystem matures and catches up to
that of the United States, which has had several more decades to evolve
since its emergence in the second half of the 20th century, the funding
proportions are starting to change. As VC returns have gained additional
momentum in recent years, pension-fund investments in Europe have
significantly increased: 2.3 times more pension funds were committed to
European venture capital in 2018 compared with the four previous years.
In 2019, capital invested in rounds of $100 million and more in Europe
was four times that of 2014. The continent also saw an increase in
megafunding rounds of $100 million and more, and even six $500
million-plus rounds, in 2019.

Despite such signs of progress, founders and funders told us in
interviews that the relative gap in ease of raising large funding rounds
has not yet fully closed, making it more difficult for European
start-ups to compete with significantly better-funded US competitors and
to become leading global players.

These issues can make European start-ups more inclined to limit risk
when pursuing exit strategies, including by spending too little on
expansion. In some cases, rapidly growing European start-ups may have
factored concerns about their abilities to raise large amounts of
follow-up capital into the decision to be acquired by US competitors
instead of trying to become global players on their own. For example,
the German collective-buying platform CityDeal was acquired by Groupon
after just six months in operation, and the Swedish payments company
iZettle had been preparing for an IPO when it sold to PayPal. Of course,
every case has its particulars, but for the highly profitable Finnish
mobile-gaming company Supercell Oy, the founders stated clearly that
they sold a majority stake to foreign investors (first SoftBank and
GungHo Online Entertainment, and now Tencent) because they felt a
"responsibility to pay out venture investors sooner rather than later."
These concerns can lead to missed opportunities: The former CEO of
Booking.com, the Dutch hotel reservation company that sold to Priceline
in 2005, has said that had other options been available at the time,
they might have held out longer for a next funding round. Today
Booking.com generates an estimated 80 percent of Priceline's revenue.

Cultural values play a role. European start-ups face much greater
pressure to perform, and to do so earlier, than start-ups in the United
States, where having a failure in one's past is typically seen as a
badge of honor (or at least a rite of passage critical for gaining the
lessons needed to ultimately succeed). We heard these sentiments echoed
repeatedly in our interviews with founders and venture capitalists, and
sentiment analysis of media coverage has shown, for example, that only
about 17 percent of press coverage in Germany portrays entrepreneurship
in a positive light, as compared with 39 percent in the United States.

  European start-ups face much greater pressure to perform, and to do so
  earlier, than start-ups in the United States.

This lack of a "risk culture" in Europe can also drive some founders to
take other, more conservative approaches that sacrifice growth
potential. For example, they might narrow ambitions to merely building a
sustainable business and regional disruptor. This could partially be
driven by the stigmatization of start-up bankruptcy in several European
countries, incentivizing founders to be more risk-averse in pursuing
growth opportunities. This would put European start-ups at a stark
disadvantage to their US peers, which more often aim for global
dominance.

However, an increasing number of recent European success stories, such
as Delivery Hero, Auto1, or N26, that focused on hypergrowth at the
expense of short-term profitability, has shifted this culture. According
to our interviews with founders around Europe, such success stories
appear to be inspiring other European start-ups to follow a similar
path.

Attracting the best talent can be difficult. While Europe has a tech
talent cost advantage compared to the United States-salaries for
software developers are as much as 50 percent lower in Europe than those
in the San Francisco Bay Area or New York City-the continent's start-ups
often lack the tools to attract the best talent. Most notably, in many
European countries unfavorable equity and stock-option rules make
start-ups less appealing to potential employees. For example, more than
75 percent of the EU countries' stock-option rules analyzed by the
European VC firm Index Ventures lagged behind those of the United
States.

At the same time, the significantly lower number of leading tech
companies and successful hypergrowth start-ups in Europe reduces the
pool of experienced executives and other talent that have hands-on
background in building IPO-sized companies. The type of operational
knowledge that comes from deep experience launching and exiting from
successful start-ups is key to scaling companies through the late
stages.

Innovation 'superhubs' are not as densely packed with resources as those
in the United States. "Superhubs" such as Silicon Valley and New York
City, which have a high concentration of entrepreneurs, tech talent, and
investors, have played a very important role in the success of the US
start-up ecosystem. Although London, Paris, Berlin, and Stockholm can be
considered the leading hubs in Europe, they have not achieved the same
concentration in terms of capital, knowledge, and talent. As a result,
only about 30 percent of European start-ups have located their
headquarters in a tech superhub-where they might have an easier time
attracting talent and funding-versus almost half of US start-ups
(Exhibit 8). Furthermore, surveys show that more than 60 percent of
founders start their companies where they live or where they have family
and support systems. Of course, relocating within the United States is
not the same as relocating within Europe, given that in the United
States the language and culture will generally be the same. However, if
COVID-19 means that working remotely or from home becomes more common,
this disparity might become less problematic and potentially could
lessen the importance of superhubs.

Even though conditions are improving, the challenges facing Europe's
start-up ecosystem remain significant. To overcome them, there are three
key areas in particular to consider. The first among these is
harmonization and active policy making. Europe could continue to
streamline its regulatory frameworks, which remain complex for start-ups
to navigate easily. Many European start-ups are seeking to expand
operations to multiple regions early on. Similarly, legal frameworks
could be reassessed to allow European start-ups to attract and retain
the necessary talent to build and scale new companies. Underpinning all
of this could be a vision that aims both to defend Europe's existing
strengths and to build and support areas of potential growth.

Second, leveraging Europe's assets, which include its public sector and
its relative strength in the B2B arena, is critical to growing the
start-up ecosystem. As large contractors, governments are key drivers
with the power to support innovation. Through this lever, Europe can
actively promote its start-up ecosystem. The B2B sectors offer
particularly fertile ground here, as the continent's entrepreneurs have
already established a solid foundation of innovation by digitizing the
activities that serve other businesses-and even more so now, as the
coronavirus crisis has created an expectation that more business will be
conducted digitally. Europe could also build on another relative
strength, sustainability, as the business opportunities around the
growing conversation of stakeholder responsibility continue to expand.
Europe is a leader in this area and is well positioned to capitalize on
this asset.

Third, Europe could look at how to support the culture and capital
needed to further grow its start-up ecosystem. Entrepreneurs could take
advantage of the improving conditions for start-ups to broaden their
ambitions and aim for global leadership. Governments could further this
through more risk-willing capital, and considering allocating more
semi-public funds toward growing the ecosystem, as well as fostering
collaboration between ventures, academia, and industry. It could also
prove beneficial to improve conditions for capital and funding-for
example, by leveraging European and global partnerships with aligned
incentives to allow them to scale faster.

Maharashtra failed in 'Start Up' policy, alleges Prithviraj Chavan

Mumbai: Senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan attacked the Devendra
Fadnavis led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government for its failure to
implement the 'Start Up' policy and has lagged behind in 'Ease of Doing'
policy with declining industrial development.

Referring to the 'State Startup Ranking Report-2018,' published by the
union department for industry on December 20, Chavan alleged,
Maharashtra is almost ranked below in India right now, while Gujarat has
secured the top position and advised Fadnavis should learn from
neighbouring Gujarat. Sudhir Mungantiwar, the finance minister rubbished
these allegations made by Chavan and said as a former chief minister,
Chavan should not indulge in defaming his own state, especially based on
some false information.

Chavan interacted with media on Monday. He has blamed Fadnavis
government for being lethargic in bringing the Start UP policy only in
January this year, while Andhra Pradesh was the first to implement it in
2014. Chavan said Fadnavis had made a fake promise of making the state
the capital of Start-ups. "Out of 27 states and three Union Territories,
Maharashtra is not ranked in the first 15 slots and that is very
shameful," he said.

Chavan also blamed Fadnavis government for slowing down the industrial
development. "Since the Fadnavis-led BJP government has come into power,
the growth rate of industries in Maharashtra has been decreasing
consistently. From 7.2 per cent in 2015-16 and 6.9 per cent in 2016-17,
the rate fell to 6.5 per cent in 2017-18. In the past four years, the
government has promoted 'Make in Maharashtra' and 'Magnetic Maharashtra'
through massive advertisement campaigns, but has failed miserably in
delivering their promises," he further alleged.

Chavan also stated, the State's position in the Ease of Doing Business
has also been on the decline. The state ranked 8th in 2015, while it
came down to rank 10, in 2016 and 13, in the year 2018.Mungantiwar
clarified, "There are 14,036 approved start up units across the country.
Of which, the highest number, 2787 are in Maharashtra which makes it the
state capital of Start Up units." The minister also stated, the
industrial growth rate of the country is at 4.4 percent whereas it is
6.5 percent of Maharashtra.

Will the coronavirus mean failure for African startups?

Mar 30, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business:
http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex) African
startups have on average a roughly 50% chance of making it, according to
a report. But country figures differ significantly, and the ongoing
COVID-19 scare could hurt the continent's entrepreneurs.Startups in
Africa have a better chance of making it than their peers in the US or
India, according to a recent report called "Tracing the success and
failure of African startups," by Greentec Capital Africa Foundation and
WeeTracker. African startups founded and operated from 2010 to 2018 had
a 54% chance of failing.

That's lower than 67% for the US and India's 90% for firms set up around
the same time period.But the situation varies significantly across the
continent. At 25%, Mozambique was the African nation with the lowest
failure rate. In other countries, the likelihood of winding down
operations were much higher.The failure rate may be an indicator of the
amount of activity in a startup ecosystem, according to WeeTracker's
Nayantara Jha."One reason for a low failure rate on a macro level is the
number of startups in a market," she explains.Global tech media firm
WeeTracker only included companies that fulfilled certain criteria from
a database of thousands of firms. Only 500 companies in 35 countries
across the continent landed in the final data analysis. It also broke
down the results by industry. Another finding: Digital firms were more
likely to fail than product-based firms, whereas social media and
e-commerce were the worst performers.That's because a physical product
already has a value, says Thomas Festerling, CEO of Greentec."It's
easier to sell [a product] and maybe adapt it," he explains. "You are
not just depending on follow-up financing all the time.Money, money,
money?African startups that received external funding were significantly
less likely to fail, with only one in five ceasing business operations.
That could potentially explain the high failure rates for startups in
the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe, where there's a lack of
external funding. But even while that was the case, countries with
higher levels of foreign investment in startups also had higher levels
of failure for firms that received external funding.Money isn't
everything. Resources may even play a more significant role in
determining success, says Festerling. That's something he has observed
in his work with Greentec, which supports entrepreneurs across several
African countries."It's quite difficult to get the [required] skill set
in the team, and the resources and technology that you need," Festerling
explains. "A partner that supports [a startup] operationally can
actually be more valuable than a big funding round," he adds.Hard times
aheadAfrican startups have been raising more money every year, with 2019
reaching a record that exceeded $1 billion (€900 million) for the first
time. The outlook for 2020 was also optimistic until the coronavirus
became a global pandemic. The economic fallout from the COVID-19
outbreak will hurt African tech firms. The "supply of money" is now the
biggest concern, says Moses Acquah of Afrolynk, an organization that
supports African entrepreneurs.The continent's countries are now slowly
closing borders and imposing lockdowns, with Rwanda and South Africa
leading the way last week. While these measures may help stem rising
coronavirus infections, they will also hurt economies. That has been the
experience in other markets. The latest US unemployment figures surged
to 3.3 million from 280,000 a week earlier. Experts have linked them to
movement restriction and business closures amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The same could happen in Africa."[Startups] need to pay salaries, they
need to generate revenue," Acquah says. "But revenue comes from
customers who are most likely to be laid off," he adds.Preparing for
SARS-CoV-2 falloutEconomists expect a global economic slowdown. Earlier
in March, the UN's Economic Commission for Africa said the continent's
GDP growth would slow to 1.8% from 3.2% due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some startups could benefit from the lockdowns, especially those working
in areas such as health and education technology. However, investors are
set to become more cautious."Both the venture capitals and business
angels will look much more closer at the companies [to see] if they've
done their homework," says Greentec CEO, who also invests in African
startups.He believes potential investors will try to determine whether a
company has what it takes to get through the ongoing crisis.African
businesses will need to demonstrate they can chart their way through
oncoming economic slowdown. Government support is extremely unlikely.
Last week, African finance ministers sent a letter asking for $100
billion from the IMF, the World Bank and the ECB. Two-fifths of that
amount would go to debt servicing. The rest would be used to help the
health and social systems cope with the economic fallout from COVID-19.
Saving startups won't be high on the agenda.Still, experts say African
firms can take advantage of some policy changes. Policymakers are
already trying to counter the imminent slowdown. Some central banks cut
key interest rates, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing. That could
allow companies to line up enough credit to make it through this
crisis.Greentec has been advising the African startups it works with to
ensure they have enough liquidity for 12 to 18 months. CEO Festerling
has been telling the firms to take a proactive stance. They need to make
their situation transparent to all different stakeholders, including
landlords who may have to wait longer for the rent, he says."It's
important to really identify what can be done to survive the corona
crisis," Festerling warns.

Japanese startup loses communication with lunar lander, assumes mission
failure

The Thaiger

Length: 597 words

Body

A Japanese start-up hoping to realise the first private Moon landing
announced today that it had lost contact with its spacecraft, suggesting
a disappointing outcome for the ambitious mission. Ispace confirmed that
communication with the unmanned Hakuto-R lunar lander could not be
re-established after the expected time of landing, signifying a
premature end for a mission launched from the United States just over
four months ago.

Twenty-five minutes past the anticipated landing time, a company
spokesperson addressed the media noting that they had been unable to
make contact with the lunar lander. 'We have to assume that we could not
complete the landing on the lunar surface,' the spokesperson added. Team
members will continue to attempt to establish communication with the
spacecraft, which carried payloads from various countries, including a
lunar rover from the United Arab Emirates.

Ispace's founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada confirmed that data from the
spacecraft had been captured up to the planned landing time and would be
analysed to better understand what happened.

The Hakuto-R lunar lander, measuring little over two metres in height
and weighing 340 kilos had been in lunar orbit since last month. With
its fully automated descent and landing systems, it was designed to
re-establish communication immediately upon touching down on the lunar
surface.

Thus far, only the US, Russia, and China have successfully landed
spacecraft on the Moon - all through government-backed programmes. A
failed 2019 attempt saw SpaceIL, an Israeli organisation, witness their
lander crash into the Moon's surface. India also made an unsuccessful
attempt to land a spacecraft on the Moon in 2016. Later this year, two
American companies - Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines - also have lunar
landings planned.

In celebration of their colleagues' efforts, Astrobotic tweeted, 'We
congratulate the ispace inc team on accomplishing a significant number
of milestones on their way to today's landing attempt.' Recognising the
challenges faced, they added, 'We hope everyone recognises - today is
not the day to shy away from pursuing the lunar frontier, but a chance
to learn from adversity and push forward.'

Before the unfortunate conclusion of the Hakuto-R mission, Ispace, which
recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Growth Market,
had established plans for its next venture. The company launched the
Hakuto-R (named after the Moon-dwelling white rabbit of Japanese
folklore) from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on
December 11.

The lunar lander transported several rovers, including a small,
spherical robot jointly developed by Japan's space agency and toy
manufacturer Takara Tomy, responsible for the creation of Transformer
toys. Additionally, it carried the 10-kilo Rashid rover, developed by
the United Arab Emirates, and an experimental imaging system from
Canadensys Aerospace.

With a workforce of only 200, Ispace seeks to 'extend the sphere of
human life into space' and create a sustainable world through the
provision of frequent and low-cost transportation services to the Moon.
Speaking about the mission, Hakamada expressed his vision for the Moon's
immense potential to be harnessed to 'transform it into a robust and
vibrant economic system.'

The company predicts that, by 2040, the Moon will support a population
of 1,000 people, with an additional 10,000 visitors each year. Further
plans for a second mission, tentatively set for next year, are in
development, including both a lunar landing and the deployment of the
firm's own rover.

Venture Capitalists to provide strategic direction to startups

India, May 14 -- The importance of start-ups in an economy cannot be
undermined as they are technological revolutionaries, disruptors and
creators. They create new industries, provide jobs, increase income
levels, improve quality of life and play a critical role in the changing
the image of a nation. With as many as 50,000 startups, of which a
significant increase is from tier-II and tier-III cities like Kochi,
Ahmedabad and Pune, India is now considered world's 3rd largest
ecosystem, according to Startup India portal.

However, failure is the other side of Startup industry. In a study
conducted by Oxford Economics and IBM's Institute of Business Value, it
was found that 90% of India's startups fail due to lack of innovation.
In fact, according to KPMG report, in 2020, revenue of atleast 30
percent of Indian startups declined by about 80 percent, whereas 70
percent of them had the probability of running for the next three months
only.

Apart from business environment created by government and a robust
banking network, a strong venture capital industry is one of the crucial
requirements to develop successful startups. Overall, the success of
start-ups is a collaborative effort of both entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists.

Venture capitalists work in a highly competitive environment and yet
typically generate a mediocre return. Add to this the high failure rate
of entrepreneurs, a better working strategy is a critical need of the
hour for venture capitalists. The type of financing provided by venture
capitalists is unique and very different from that provided by private
equity funds or commercial banks. These organizations provide funds in
the form of corporate lending to firms that are established and have a
proven track record of operations and profitability. On the other hand,
venture capitalists provide funding to new, high risk,
technology-oriented companies that operate in a fast and volatile
environment with constantly changing paradigms. They work with
entrepreneurs with an idea but fairly less experience about implementing
the idea, identifying and putting together a competent team and
developing the customer base. The lack of experience and an established
record of performance of startups make investments in them extremely
risky and uncertain. According to Harvard Business School's
entrepreneurship professor Shikhar Ghosh, about three-quarters of
startups backed by venture capitalists are not successful enough to
return cash to their investors. Therefore, the role of venture capitals
has to be much more than selecting a good business and provide funding
and should extend to value-creation. In addition to providing strategic
direction, most venture capitalists are already extending their support
to various functional aspects of start-ups. Firstly, venture capitalists
help in team building in start-ups by identifying and recruiting
appropriate talent, which is the most important asset of a start-up.
Secondly, providing support to the administrative activities like
accounting, legal and other routine organizational responsibilities can
free up founders' time which can be further used for growing business.
Thirdly, venture capitalists help start-ups in building the right skills
for all employees and the leadership team. Fourthly, probably the most
important, is providing strategic focus by defining the target market,
underlining the scope of the product or service, identifying the
competitive advantage and providing appropriate strategic direction.
Additionally, support to building a customer base is an essential
encouragement. And lastly, the most important aspect of venture
capitalist and entrepreneur relation is access to its network. Venture
capitalists also provide performance metrics to startups to monitor,
measure and report their performance at their early stage.

So, on what basis should a venture capital fund decide the extent of its
involvement in a startup - at a very basic level, the participation is
only financial; the next level is mentorship and guidance; and the
advanced level is operational. The decision is ought to be made by
analyzing its assets and resources. The most common and important
resource of a VC is cash that represents the absolute amount of funds
available. If the cash resources are strong, VCs would invest in an
administrative function that would add value to a startup, and in case
the cash resources are not strong, VCs can introduce the startups to
their network which can meaningfully assist them. Brand resources are
also very important for a VC which can be evaluated by the frequency of
their citing in print, electronic and social media. Network resources
are perhaps the most crucial of all contributions towards the growth of
startups. Introductions to members of personal networks can help
startups in either time-savings or cost-savings or both.

Startups should celebrate failures. This is how to keep the
experimenting culture alive

Jun 02, 2021( e27: https://e27.co Delivered by Newstex) ;

The age-old adage, 'if at first, you don't succeed, try again' is
applicable to countless scenarios. However, in the startup world, trying
new things until becoming successful is only half the story.

In the startup world, things move at a rapid pace and ideas alone do not
bring success. Success requires implementation and the right
implementation process requires different business experiments in order
to test and validate those ideas.

Experimentation can be as small as tweaking the font on a website or as
big as pivoting the entire business, as long as these are steps towards
a predetermined goal.

As Dr. Bechara Saab, CEO and co-founder of Mobio Interactive, a digital
therapeutics company, rightly puts it, 'Ultimately, the truth is very
powerful. And experimentation helps you identify what is most likely to
be the truth.' The truth is indeed very powerful from any way that you
think about it, but particularly in terms of understanding how the
business will succeed.

Greig Charlton, CEO of 247, a Shanghai-based lifestyle company that uses
data to make it easier and cheaper for consumers to purchase products
and experiences in China, believes that experimentation is a privilege
that startups have that corporations do not.

Most corporates are fettered by layers of bureaucracy as everything
needs to be signed off at several levels. Speaking from his own
corporate experience, he mentions how anything he wanted to get done
required approval from the manager, and then the manager of the manager.

Startups are lean and can test things faster[1], which allows them to be
able to find the right market fit much quicker than it would take an
average corporate.

Programme[2]

However, just understanding the fact that experimenting with new ideas
is important is not enough. This begs the question, how do decide what
experiments to run and what needs to be considered before experimenting?

Segment your audience

One of the keys to conducting a successful experiment is segmenting the
audience. For a company that is just starting up, it makes sense to test
out new features or tactics on the entire user base but as the numbers
grow, it is pertinent that they segment the target group so as to avoid
losing clients or customers if the experiment does not work out.

Woovly, a lifestyle shop that connects beauty, fashion and wellness
brands to their customers, started out as a wishlist aggregator in the
travel industry with 900,000 users before the pandemic hit.

As travel was one of the most affected areas, Woovly decided to move
into the lifestyle segment but that would risk losing their existing
customer base since they signed up for something completely different.

Venkat J, CEO and co-founder, explains that the company segmented the
user base, applied several experiments to understand the user behaviour,
and ran experiments on partitioned groups until the new market fit was
achieved.

As a result of this mindful practice, Woovly now has over three million
registered users - a growth rate of more than 200 per cent in just nine
months.

transitioned into a lifestyle company

Small tweaks can have a colossal impact

Experiments don't always have to be big and in scale. Sometimes the
smallest experiments can bring the biggest of impacts.

Understanding that brand mentions play a significant role in a brand's
value in the lifestyle industry, Woovly first experimented with their
content creation platform by providing users with a new feature to add
brand names to their content.

This experiment saw successful results with almost 77 per cent of the
users that tried the new feature. Next, they built on this experiment
with better UI/UX, and within seven months, they managed to generate
750,000 brand-tagged user-generated content.

Have a good system in place

Trying and testing out new ideas does not guarantee success, but
experimentation does minimise the probability of big failure. However,
this is only true if the experiments are logically designed. Misguided
(or even incomplete) experiments will often generate misleading results.

Indian healthtech startup Phable's co-founder and CEO, Sumit Sinha,
shares his experience wherein skipping some experimentation steps proved
catastrophic for the company (but also a good lesson for future
experiments). As the demand for teleconsultations rose during the
COVID-19 pandemic, Phable experimented with this new feature offline
first.

However, they made the mistake of moving quickly to bringing out to the
public without getting any conclusive results from the experiment.
Eventually, the company could not retain the new customers it had
onboarded, which is why Sumit stressed having a good system in place and
making sure all steps of the experimentation process are followed.

But the entire experiment was not a failure - ultimately the company is
stronger as they realised where they went wrong and made the necessary
changes.

247tickets conducted several experiments from the get-go. As Charlton
mentions, they used to simply run experiments without any process in
place. If the experiments didn't work, they just forgot about them and
if they did work, the team would double down on them.

Now, they have a 'project brief template' which is essentially a
procedure to define what the project will be. The person running the
experiment fills out all the details including the hypothesis, budget,
user groups, target users among other information which allows them to
get a holistic view of the process. Having the right tools allows them
to use the resources in a more optimal way.

Matthew Spriegel, CEO of Atiom - a mobile-first plug and play technology
that elevates learning and engagement across organisations, also
believes that experimentation is the key to figuring out how to generate
leads.

Atiom uses a demo walkthrough that they send out to clients. This allows
them to see how individual users interact differently with the
walkthrough and make changes as required.

Experimenting without a system in place, hence, is as good as trying to
hit the bullseye with a blindfold in place: you are shooting your
arrows, but you have no idea where they are going.

Don't experiment only when things go wrong

Experimentation is not a quick fix or stopgap. Successful entrepreneurs
continue to innovate to stay competitive. While it is pertinent to
conduct experiments and try new options when things do not go your way,
this isn't the only time experimentation is valuable.

Charlton believes that the best thing to do is to experiment when things
are going well because that gives you an added advantage. Unlike
corporates who may be content with just growing 1 per cent or 5 per cent
each year, startups do not have that luxury.

The startup ecosystem is extremely competitive and sometimes having a
growth rate in higher two-digits also may not be enough. The only way to
stay ahead of the curve is to think differently[5], run as many
experiments as you can, and find the best growth techniques versus the
number of resources or money spent. Experimenting only when things
aren't working will ultimately slow the company down.

Matthew also has a similar opinion, where he believes founders must
definitely not break things that are working. It is good to reflect and
make changes. Everything the company does must reflect the evolution of
its products or services.

Dr Saab does not see any reason a company should stop experimentation
either. Perfection does not exist and so from that perspective, there's
always room to grow and improve. If founders stop experimenting, then
the competition may very well pass them. The only way to maintain the
business and continue growth or even to stay the same size is to
continue to experiment.

Build an environment that fosters proactiveness

Conducting experiments and trying new things at a frequent pace is
taxing. A founder will undoubtedly have more drive and motivation to see
the company succeed than the employees. This means it is critical to
make sure that employees are as involved as possible.

Mobio Interactive has a very 'simple' approach to solving this - control
the culture. All the founders put in a lot of time thinking about a
unique corporate culture for their business that structurally ensures
company-wide involvement and supports an idea-meritocracy.

Even before they hire somebody, they have that individual examine their
corporate culture document and highlight what they feel are its
strengths and weaknesses.

Also Read:Here are the most promising startups in the 5G space[6]

This allows the founders to understand how to improve the culture, while
also ensuring that every new member of the team buys into the culture,
understands why it is the way it is, and knows what will be expected of
them - before they join the company.

Dr. Saab adds, 'To run experiments and fail, is something we see as an
opportunity. It is, because of its failure, in truth a success because
we're learning. So, our employees, for that reason, are not demotivated
when an experiment fails, or when a favourite hypothesis proves wrong.

It is fully understood that the important thing is that we grow, and we
can grow faster by focusing on our weaknesses. Weaknesses, after all,
almost always represent our biggest potential to actually make a
difference.'

Charlton believes in transparency to create a more conducive work
environment. 'If people see other people failing, and not getting into
trouble, and in fact being celebrated, then it's a really good way of
inspiring people to be okay with failing. That's probably the biggest
thing that we try and do.

We're not great at it, but we try to instill that transparency and make
sure that everyone can see. In fact, I've run experiments before where
we fail, and it's about celebrating that failure. It's about saying
okay, here's what we did, and it didn't work, but what we're going to do
next time is this, and it's going to work, and then maybe it fails
again, and then we try again.'

This type of transparent culture reduces fear and lets everyone thrive.

Experimentation is not easy and is critical to every startup's success.
As Dr. Saab puts it, 'If you're not prepared to continue to fail and to
learn and to be open to it with yourself and to be bold, then you're
going to have a real hard time. And if you've already taken the risk to
start a company in the first place, then not taking additional risks
becomes your biggest risk at all.'

India, Aug. 17 -- Though the popularity of entrepreneurship is fast
advancing north side, but startup venture brings its own unique set of
practical/cultural challenges and problems that its leaders must think
and commit to address these.

Entrepreneurial adventurism is on rampage across the world as more and
more millennials opting for this route rather going for jobs and
limiting their life to 9 to 6 sort of routine. Youngsters are
collaborating in their colleges itself to form a startup or joins hands
after college to solve a business problem and earn high while aiming
high. They have fantastic ideas though, but with no experience to make
right moves, many a time they land up in situation where either they get
a taste of failure or business start running at snail's pace leading to
internal chaos leading to impending failure. It's a facts that there are
more funding opportunities available than ever before. To fuel it
further professional courses and content on how to start your own
business are easily accessible over the internet, and
institution/community-driven incubators and innovation hubs are
mushrooming all over the country. So, it's a good idea and time to be
engaged in the startup venture. Let me bet here, this is an industry
which is not going anywhere or slowing down anytime soon.

Though the popularity of entrepreneurship is fast advancing north side,
but startup venture brings its own unique set of practical/cultural
challenges and problems that its leaders must think and commit to
address these. Listed below are several challenges that today's
entrepreneurs are facing today, and advice on how they should be
tackled. But the whole startup top line will have to work hard together
to overcome these hurdles, where they will collectively create a startup
with culture that's inclusive, efficient, and valuable for every
stakeholder.

But before we embark the startup journey, an important question must be
in our mind- Why do startups fail in the first place and failure rate is
so high? One of the key trigger behind failure is the few high level
risks being associated with startups. These mainly are business strategy
adoption and then execution failures. Well friends, we will discuss all
this here, with a focused approach as to what are the most common
pitfalls of a startups and try finding possible solutions:

1. The first and most critical step is to choose your partners with
extreme care and due diligence. Once done then trust them with watchful
eyes. Start trust building exercise from the day one.

2. Know your partner for at least a reasonable time which can vary from
6 to 12 months. Evaluate him on your parameters. And yes, check if you
too fit on those parameters and if not then don't expect him to be 100%.

3. Build a robust business strategy with deep involvement from the
partners/stakeholders. If required take help of mentors and consultants
you have with you.

4. Rather controlling, give them free hand but bind them with processes/
policies. Please note that you should be the first to follow the
processes/Policies. This avoids most of the conflicts resulting out of
misunderstanding. It also saves you legally in case of an issue.

5. Trust your business instincts and document everything to strengthen
the processes and mutual trust further.

6. Choose partner who possesses the skills you don't have. Remember
learning is always mutual. And for this wear the hats of being a teacher
as well as avid learner.

7. Find out how your potential partners thinks. Respect their views. Any
disagreement should be in close chamber. Be ready to change yourself as
well if require so at any point of time. Remember a little adjustment
saves a big disaster in business.

8. Ensure you share every business issue/problem with partner before he
knows from other sources later. This ensures each partner is on the same
page always. Letting him know the things he must know before other know
them will empower him as loyal stakeholder.

9. Learn when to break the partnership before it breaks the business.
This is extremely important and thoughtful exercise. Any such break must
be only after careful assessment. Most of the breaks can be salvaged
before final decision. So give it a serious chance first.

10. No business can run without use of a technology. Right people and
processes are the keys to select the right technology for the business.
One should not compromise on this until you have limited funds. Remember
not to do overrun.

11. Periodic reviews are of immense importance to bring continuous
improvements and address issues before they become critical. A good
process of business review sets the tone of a successful business. An
external mentor/consultant may be a great source to set this process
right from the very beginning.

12. Keep work freedom and financial freedom separate. Second one needs
stricter check and balances and any unmindful freedom in this aspect can
break the entire business ecosystem.

13. And last but not the least is manage success and growth. This
requires lot of patience and coolness in attitude. Most of startup
turmoil are result of this factor. Success brings attitude and ego both
and these bring change in behavior resulting into a silent unrest
boiling underneath. Seek advice to handle success.

Though there is a long list of sound advices for startup owners and
partners but aforesaid key points will keep the people and business both
in synchronization where you get maximum output in terms of business and
bottom-line both. Have a great startup journey.

SEBI should be more sensitive to valuations, must act against errant
merchant bankers: Amarjit Chopra

CFO

Body

December 19 -- Amarjit Chopra, former President at the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India and a part-time member of the country's
audit watchdog, the National Financial Reporting Authority, chats with
ETCFO about the role of the market regulator, the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in the IPO pricing. Also an independent
director on numerous firms, he further discusses governance and the
responsibility of the corporate boards in the recent layoffs at the
new-age internet firms. Edited excerpts: Q: SEBI's Chairperson Madhabi
Puri Buch has categorically said the regulator has no business in IPO
pricing and has emphasised a need for more disclosures. How is your
reading of the regulators' role in valuations? Amarjit Chopra: SEBI's
Chairperson is entitled to have her view. However, I respectfully
disagree with her. In the old times of the Controller of Capital Issues,
valuation was always looked at by the regulator. We all need to
appreciate that the sole objective of document filing with SEBI cannot
merely be scrutiny of proper disclosures. Also, it cannot be merely to
check the arithmetical accuracy of the information for various years or
the kind of language used. 

SEBI has an onerous responsibility of protecting the interest of the
investors.

And in my opinion evaluation of valuation is the most critical for the
same. In case it is not the responsibility of SEBI today let them assume
it rather than shying away from it and merely relying upon the valuation
of the merchant Banker. SEBI needs to be more sensitive to valuations
and act against merchant bankers in case of negligence..

To my utter dismay, SEBI has not proceeded to get the veracity of
revenue models, and valuations checked even after post listing debacle
in case of various issues. There has to be a mechanism to ensure the
conduct of merchant bankers. The public would certainly be interested to
know as to what action has been taken against the promoters, directors,
and merchant bankers in all the cases under discussion for the
justification of various assumptions used for working out the
valuations.

Q: What do you think of the corporate governance practices in new-age
firms? Concerns have risen from valuation to the conduct of promoters to
now massive layoffs...Amarjit Chopra: It is important to understand the
importance of new-age firms particularly in the Indian context today. In
August 2022 there were more than 75,000 start-ups in India. Presently
there may be in the range of one lakh approximately. Not only these
start-ups are trying to exploit an idea in commercial venture thereby
providing employment to lakhs of people rather they also have huge
investments from various investors from India and abroad. It is
essential that these start-ups are governed in a manner that the chances
of failure are bleak and the reputation of Indian new-age firms remains
protected.But unfortunately, once an idea is conceived and it is
perceived to be of commercial interest to investors, governance
considerations take a back seat. Good governance is core to the
sustainability of any enterprise start-up or otherwise. It is essential
to ensure that the affairs are conducted in a legal and ethical manner.
Transparency, accountability, and responsive communication are key to
good governance. 

Founders or promoters have been more concerned with valuations rather
than the sound principles of governance. And poor governance, including
poor planning to arrange for adequate finances when required, inability
to hire the right kind of people, inability to establish the objective
revenue model, and fear on part of investors and directors to raise
their voices at the right point in time has to lead to failure of a
number of start-ups..

In certain cases like Zomato, and Paytm despite where the public issue
was at much higher valuations, the stock prices have declined
substantially and the investors have lost huge money. This has eroded
public faith in the valuations of start-ups. Consequently, the promoters
are being shown in poor light. Also, failures of start-ups or their
inability to organise funds at the right time have resulted in extensive
layoffs. This is a matter of grave concern particularly when the country
is grappling with the problem of rising unemployment due to varied
reasons.

 

Q: Which is the weakest link of governance in new-age firms? Is it the
corporate boards or the management or the promoters or someone
else? Amarjit Chopra: A new age firm to be successful has to have a
product, capital, market, and good governance. There are various
challenges faced by new-age firms. These would include lack of financial
resources, failure to plan properly and effectively, lack of demand,
lack of tenacity on part of promoters, ineffective marketing which could
either be due to lack of resources or improper understanding of the
market, lack of skilled staff, lack of sound revenue model, and cost of
compliance due to frequent changes in the regulations, etc.It may be
difficult to point out any single factor as a weak link in the new-age
firms. To me, recent failures are caused by a combination of factors
like lack of resources to support infrastructure, failure to assess the
market for the product, lack of a plan, particularly for a sound revenue
model, and the inability of board members to raise pertinent issues at
right time out of fear or lack of knowledge and desire of promoters and
investors to look for unrealistic valuations. Hence, it is more than one
factor to be the weak link in new-age firms.Q: What does the role of the
gatekeepers like auditors, and the independent directors as well as the
Audit Committees and Risk Management Committees look like in ensuring
governance at these new-age companies?Amarjit Chopra: To me, every
gatekeeper has a well-defined role. To my mind besides promoters,
management, and regulators, both auditors and independent directors as
well are pillars of corporate governance. They need to be firm without
being obstacles in the functioning of new-age firms. They need to ensure
transparency and accountability.Both Audit Committee and Risk Management
Committee have crucial roles to play in the sustainability of
enterprises. The audit committee needs to ensure that various internal
controls including the internal audit system are in place to minimise
the risk of fraud and frittering away of the assets. The Committee is
also responsible to approve the related party transactions if any to
ensure that the same are at arm's length. The Committee also interacts
with internal and statutory auditors to have their input on the
aforesaid matters and ensures proper disclosures and compliances.The
Risk Management Committee, on the other hand, identifies various kinds
of risks pertaining to finance, human resources, regulatory, market,
etc. The Committee assesses such risks and identifies steps to mitigate
those risks on a regular basis.But I would hasten to add that in most of
the cases the Committee members have shied away from raising the
relevant issues at the relevant point in time and the same has proved to
be fatal, particularly for the new age firms.So far as the audit is
concerned role of internal audit is extremely critical in identifying
weaknesses in the system and suggesting timely remedial
measures. Internal Auditors need to be dynamic and bold enough to point
out flaws and ways to plug the same. Regarding the statutory auditors,
they have a duty to express an opinion with regard to the truth and
fairness of the financial statements. They need to ensure proper
disclosures under the law and as may be warranted or critical under the
circumstances. They need to ensure compliance with accounting and
auditing standards. 

Statutory auditors need to exercise professional scepticism. Their
examination, particularly in new age firms, of the Going Concern status
of enterprise by looking at revenue model, availability of funds, and
other non-financial information e.g market-related, is indeed critical.
Statutory auditors need to ensure objective reporting protecting the
interests of various stakeholders..

Q: What are the key lessons from the recent failed public issuances for
the new-age companies thinking of going public?

Amarjit Chopra: The silver lining could be that in subsequent issues of
new-age firms, merchant bankers would be more careful in identifying and
assessing the various risks affecting the valuations of new-age firms
willing to go public. Merchant Bankers would do well to study the market
risks, revenue generation, and other sustainability issues in such cases
before issuing the valuations.

Review of Lok Sabha proceedings on Dec 14

The Indian Awaaz

December 15, 2022 Thursday

Dateline: India

Body

India, Dec. 15 -- The Lok Sabha passed 'The Supplementary Demands for
Grants - First Batch for 2022-23 and Demand for Excess Grants for
2019-20'. The bill authorises the government to spend additional 3.25
lakh crore rupees in Financial Year 2023.

Replying to the debate, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asserted
that Indian economy is going strong with its highest growth rate among
the major economies and inflation going down. She also rejected the
opposition's criticism of the economy that it is likely to be hit by
stagflation and said India is seeing high growth while inflation has now
dipped below the RBI's upper tolerance level of 6 per cent. Retail
inflation has moderated to an 11-month low of 5.8 per cent in November
from 6.77 per cent in the previous month.

The government will bring it down further for the sake of common people,
she said while replying to a discussion on the first batch of
Supplementary Demands for Grants 2022-23. She said, the government is
constantly watching the price situation of essential commodities.

With regard to fiscal deficit, the Finance Minister said the government
would be able to meet the fiscal deficit target of 6.4 per cent of the
GDP for the current financial year. The government is committed to the
path of fiscal consolidation, she said.

On non-performing assets, Sitharaman said it has come down drastically
to 7.28 per cent at the end of March 2022 due to various measures taken
by the Modi government.

On the declining value of the rupee against the US dollar, she said, the
domestic unit is appreciating against all other currencies, and the fall
against the greenback is lower as compared to other currencies.

Quoting the World Bank report, she said India's forex reserves is one of
the highest in the world and this provides a cushion against the global
spill-over.

Participating in the debate, Supriya Shule of NCP said, the government
should not take piecemeal measures and instead table a comprehensive
bill to give reservation benefits to different communities in all
states.

Ranjeetsinha Naik Nimbalkar of BJP, Hanuman Beniwal of RLP and P.
Ravindhranath of AIADMK demanded reservation benefits for different
communities in their states under appropriate categories.

Lok Sabha also took up the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Second
Amendment) Bill, 2022 for consideration and passage.

Supriya Shule of NCP said, the government should not take piecemeal
measures and instead table a comprehensive bill to give reservation
benefits to different communities in all states.

Ranjeetsinha Naik Nimbalkar of the BJP, Hanuman Beniwal of RLP and P.
Ravindhranath of AIADMK demanded reservation benefits for different
communities in their states under appropriate categories.

Replying to a question, Union Minister Piyush Goyal told Lok Sabha that
the success rate of the start-ups in India is higher than the rest of
the world and there were 84,012 recognised start-ups in the country at
the end of November. He said, to boost the start-up ecosystem, the
government launched the Start-up India initiative on January 16, 2016,
along with an action plan was also put in place. Start-ups are prone to
failures but the success rate of start-ups in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world. The number of recognised startups has
increased from 452 in 2016 to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022, the
Minister said.

Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw took a swipe at opposition
parties, saying the BSNL suffered badly due to certain political parties
as it was used as a cash cow by some people who are still members of
Parliament. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved a huge
project worth 1.64 lakh crore rupees for the revival of BSNL, and this
will transform the telecom PSU completely. He said, the BSNL will soon
launch 4G and 5G networks designed, developed and made in the country as
per Modi's 'Make in India' initiative. He said at present, mobile data
in India is one of the cheapest in the world as one gigabyte data is
available for less than 20 rupees. This was around 200 rupees during the
UPA rule, the minister said. He said the revival measures focus on
infusing fresh capital for upgrading BSNL services, allocating spectrum,
de-stressing its balance sheet and augmenting its fibre network by
merging the Bharat Broadband Nigam Limited with the BSNL.

Earlier, soon after the Question Hour, Congress members led by Sonia
Gandhi and Trinamool Congress members walked out of the House, accusing
the government of not allowing a discussion on the sensitive India-China
border issue.

As soon as the Question Hour ended, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury of Congress
demanded that a discussion on the Indo-China border situation be held,
saying the then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had allowed a
discussion in the Lok Sabha on the India-China war in 1962.

In 1962, when India-China war took place, Nehru in this House had given
165 MPs chance to speak, and a decision was taken on what to do only
after that, Chowdhury said.

Responding to the Congress leader's demand, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla
said a decision will be taken on it in the meeting of the Business
Advisory Committee.

As the Speaker continued with the proceedings of the House, the
Congress, as well as the members of TMC, staged a walkout in protest and
accused the government of not allowing a discussion on the India-China
border issue.

Sudip Bandyopadhyay of TMC said, his party members were staging a
walkout in protest against the attitude" of the government.

Opposition members had walked out of Lok Sabha in protest against
various issues soon after the House met as well.

As soon as the House met for the day, members from the Congress and the
DMK wanted to raise certain issues. One of the members displayed a
printout with the words "Justice for Stan Swamy".

The Speaker told the protesting members that the Question Hour was
important. However, they sought to raise various issues.

Later, members belonging to Congress, DMK, NCP and the NC among others
walked out of the House.

During the Zero Hour, Janardhan Singh Sigriwal of BJP raised the issue
of Bihar hooch tragedy in the Lok Sabha demanding immediate suspension
of Superintendent of Police of Saran. He said claimed that people are
dying in large numbers consuming illicit liquor in Bihar. About a dozen
people have lost their lives in today's hooch tragedy in Saran district
of Bihar, he said.

His party colleague Ravi Kishan Shukla raised the issue of the death of
young actors in gyms. Mr. Shukla expressed concern over such incidents
and demanded that the Union Health Ministry set up a committee to look
into the matter. The Health Ministry should set up a probe committee to
ascertain why such deaths are happening, he said.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India] Sept 25 (ANI/NewsVoir): A nationwide study
conducting the evaluation of people managerial effectiveness in
start-ups and entrepreneurs has been launched by Great Manager Institute
in association with the Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Bombay.

Great Manager Institute (GMI) runs the Great People Manager Study where
it evaluates thousands of companies and its managers, in a bid to find
the best companies with great people managers and individual great
people managers. This Study for start-ups shall be a subset of the same.

The research report shows that 90 per cent of start-ups in India fail
within five years of their inception, while around 6000 new start-ups
come up every year. There is no clear reason attributed to the failure
of start-ups, though separate studies show lack of sustainable
innovation or lack of team bonding as some of the top reasons for
failure.

"In my experience of working with major venture capitalists across
India, I found a common pattern in most start-ups that fail after
receiving investments. Most of these companies show a problem in growing
at the right pace and with the right plan once the team expansion
begins. People Management issues lead to disintegration and
unsustainable growth", shared Ashwin Srivastava, Global Investor and
Co-founder of Great Manager Institute.

"Major VCs and Investors now consider people management abilities of the
entrepreneurs and the founding team before investing. Therefore, people
management should be in focus right at the ideation stage of a start-up.
Hence, we decided to partner with E Cell IIT Bombay and work towards
creating sustainable companies out of young start-ups, even at the
ideation stage, by helping them evaluate their people managerial
effectiveness, free of cost. The start-ups that cross our threshold will
receive a huge valuation boost through a strong media plan involving a
feature in Forbes India", added Kritika Pugalia, Client Engagement
Manager and lead for the Great People Manager Study for start-ups.

Eureka is the business model competition by the Entrepreneurship Cell
IIT Bombay and is supporting the study. "Eureka aims to develop viable
start-ups out of disruptive ideas. We do so by helping the teams develop
a business model canvas, a proof of concept, with the help of various
workshops and mentoring by leaders in the industry, over a time span of
five months. Great People Manager Study is a step in the same direction,
helping these start-ups build a sustainable business that respects
people relationships, and help them reach out to a larger audience",
said Aayushi Agrawal, Media Manager for Eureka.

Great People Manager Study 2019, the parent study for this program, led
to recognition of top 100 Great People Managers across the country along
with a list of companies that nurture great people managers. The winners
were honoured by Forbes India and included names such as Satish
Sundaresan of Elektrobit India, Gagan Jyot of RMSI, Miguel Munoz of
Mahindra Holidays, Dilipkumar Khandelwal, then with SAP India, among
others.

For entrepreneurs, failure is a part of life. Successful startup
founders become heroes and inspirations for others. But, for every
success story, there are many others that have failed - some in the
initial stages, others later. Exactly what is the emotional cost that a
founder pays when their startup shuts down?

Someone once said, "You learn more from failure than from success. Don't
let it stop you. Failure builds character." And with more and more
entrepreneurs coming back for a second and even third inning, this
stands true more than ever.

Look at K Vaitheeswaran, who came back to entrepreneurship 20 years
after setting up his first startup, which was also India's first
ecommerce platform.

So, hey - dust yourself up for we have a bouquet of startup stories to
build your character this Monday!

Delhi-based Lawyer 24x wants to be the Uber for legal help

India sees 16 lakh new cases filed every month. So, where do you get
quick and reliable legal help? Delhi-based bootstrapped Lawyer24x has
one aim - to be the "Uber" for legal help. Found in October 2017, the
startup launched an app in March 2018 that brings lawyers clauses and
sections of the IPC without even using the internet.

This startup has built a private social network for gated communities

The world is increasingly becoming smaller and more connected with
social media, mobile devices and more. Milo, which means meet in Hindi,
is a Bengaluru-based startup that is trying to build a community-focused
social media experience. Users could find a last-minute babysitter
within their residential complex, or even find someone to play
basketball with!

Kota-based Zepcross uses innovation for multi-functional backpacks

With everything else developing so fast around us, our bags need to keep
up to meet our evolving needs. Kota-based Rohan Sharma and Nishant
Sharma believe that bags need to be more than just durabie, good
looking, and functional. "A good bag means meeting requirements of a
fast-paced life, which most working people have these days," says Rohan.
So, what did they about it? Built a smart bag.

IIT alumni want businesses to outsource R&D and enable 'make in India'

Kolkata-based MetnMat Research believes that outsourcing R&D can help
businesses develop an economical cost structure, enabling them to focus
on core competencies, and make optimum use of resources. The founders
are keen to make R&D affordable, accessible, and accelerated.

Former Mindtree employees are using AI to up your shopping game

There are just too many options today. As the internet grows, so do our
options - making choosing very complicated. AskSid, founded in 2017, is
here to help. The startup delivers three business outcomes -
conversations with shoppers to simplifying experiences, better product
catalogues to showcase items to a customer, and marketing insights for
businesses to do better.

Rupeetalk founder started up in healthtech with an e-diagnostics startup

Gurugram-based KlinicApp has solved the varied pricing issue by
introducing the 'One Nation, One Price' concept. This means if you
request for a service in Kochi or Kolkata, the cost remains the same.
Founded in November 2015, it is an e-diagnostics startup that provides
services at home, across the country at the same cost.

ABSTRACT

Purpose

Technology business incubators (TBIs) form an indispensable part of an
entrepreneurial ecosystem for the promotion of tech start-ups across the
global economy. However, they have evolved in varied forms over a period
of time, in terms of typologies, sponsors and stakeholders, goals and
objectives, functions and services offered, process of incubation
support provided through hard and soft infrastructure, outcomes and
achievements and even in terms of theoretical bases. The purpose of this
paper, therefore, is to review the extant literature on TBIs to arrive
at a framework that explains how TBIs contribute to start-up generation.

Design/methodology/approach

This paper reviews extant empirical literature for a systematic
evaluation to throw light on the various dimensions of TBIs: typology,
goals and objectives, functions and services, process and provision of
incubation support, outcomes and achievements. Further, after critically
reviewing some of the theoretical propositions, it develops a conceptual
framework combining pre-incubation, incubation and post-incubation
processes of TBIs.

Findings

Based on literature understanding and some of the key theoretical
constructs, a conceptual framework is developed comprising
pre-incubation, incubation and post-incubation stages of start-up
formation and graduation. The paper also identifies some prospective
areas for future research.

Research limitations/implications

Any empirical research on technology business incubation must focus on
pre-incubation and post-incubation processes as much as on the
incubation process, to derive meaningful implications and enhance the
productivity of TBIs.

Originality/value

The conceptual framework derived out of the systematic literature review
will enable further research and exploration of micro-aspects of
pre-incubation, incubation and post-incubation phases across multiple
dimensions.

Introduction

Technology business incubators (TBIs) form one of the indispensable
components of an entrepreneurial ecosystem for technology-based
start-ups in modern economies (Alsos et al., 2011; Bala Subrahmanya,
2017). Incubating new ventures is among the key initiatives aimed at
stimulating and promoting innovative entrepreneurship and economic
growth (Corsi and Berardino, 2014; Innocenti and Zampi, 2019).
Development of local innovative firms through the promotion of
technology transfer and enablement of diffusion of products has been the
core objective of TBIs (EU, 2010). By the creation of supportive
entrepreneurial environments, TBIs have helped technology-based
start-ups to increase their survival rates (Aerts et al., 2007).

TBIs can be viewed as a mechanism to support regional development
through job creation (Thierstein and Wilhelm, 2001); for new high-tech
venture creation, technological entrepreneurship, commercialization and
transfer of technology (Mian, 1997; Phillips, 2002); and to handle and
manage market failures in the areas related to knowledge and other
inputs of innovative process (Colombo and Delmastro, 2002). About
one-third of the new firms are shut down before the third year, and
about 60 percent cannot manage to survive beyond the seventh year since
their inception (European Commission, 2002). But among TBI-based
tenants, the failure rate is about 15→20 percent (Adegbite, 2001;
Lalkaka, 2002). There is recent exploratory evidence that incubated
start-ups are able to grow faster than the start-ups that were not
incubated and that the survival rate of the former is 40 percent higher,
at 80 percent (Startupindia, 2016). For these reasons, many countries
have increasingly been engaged in establishing TBIs in various forms
(Akcomak, 2009).

TBIs support start-ups during their vulnerable early years and enable
them to graduate from the program as viable companies capable of
operating independently. Thus, TBIs play a unique role, particularly
with respect to the promotion of innovation, technology
commercialization, thus facilitating the emergence of technology-based
start-ups. Given this, the assessment of their performance and
contribution to national R&D efforts in various forms including patent
grants and new products/services ‒ at the TBI level as well as at the
start-up level ‒ becomes important. These are important, as they play a
major role in creating/strengthening the National Innovation System
through the formation of innovative firms, and they are, therefore,
decisive for accelerating the rate of economic growth of nations.

A review of literature on the various streams related to the TBIs
indicates that the phenomenon of TBIs have been explored mostly at the
macro level, exploring the contributions of TBIs to economic
development, innovation and technology commercialization, among others.
Interestingly, prior literature and knowledge on how exactly these TBIs
help in new venture creation or start-up generation has been very
scanty. These micro-aspects of the phenomenon are very important to
complement the available knowledge on TBIs. A comprehensive and thorough
insight on the key factors that enable or hinder start-up creation at
TBIs will enable a much more effective formulation of policy and further
enhance the contributions of these new ventures to the economy. It is
with this view and to address the above gap, the current study is
formulated.

This study reviews the extant literature strictly from a lens of how
various elements of the entrepreneurial ecosystem interact with one
another, leading to a start-up generation in the TBIs. The present study
conducts a systematic literature review to unravel the structure,
process and key elements of TBIs and their contribution to high-tech
start-up formation, along with R&D input and output contributions.
Subsequently, we propose to examine some of the key theoretical
propositions applied to TBIs and develop a comprehensive conceptual
framework on technology business incubation for start-up creation. We
believe that this conceptual framework will further pave way to examine
and understand the various micro-aspects that come to play in the future
studies of TBIs.

Origin and growth of TBI movement

The modern business incubation movement began with the establishment of
Stanford Research Park, California in 1951 and the Batavia Industrial
Centre in 1959 in Batavia, New York (Lewis, 2002; Ahmad and Ingle,
2011). Thus, the movement of TBIs originated in the USA, but it has
grown substantially since then. Mian et al. (2016) identified three
broad waves in the evolution of TBI models in the context of the USA:
the first wave models emerged and grew in the pre-1980s. By the year
1980, there were about 20 research and technology parks and 11 business
and/or technology incubators established in the USA. The second wave
models flourished from the 1980s till the late 1990s. By 2000, about 600
business or technology incubators and 160 research and technology parks
were in the USA. The third wave models have been emerging and
flourishing since 2000. According to the US-based National Business
Incubation Association, the number of business incubators in the USA
grew from only 12 in 1980 to over 1,250 by 2012 (Chen and Sisk, 2016).

The two major factors that contributed to the growth of incubation
movement in the USA, among others, are the inability of the state
policies to attract investments by large MNCs and the research findings
(Birch, 1979; Kirchhoff, 1994), which brought out the need to promote
start-ups and small firms to spur job growth and economic development of
the nation. The TBI movement for the promotion of start-ups has
simultaneously spread to other major economies such as the UK, Sweden,
Australia, France, Canada, Germany, China, Russia, Belgium, Brazil,
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia and India (Mian et
al., 2016). Currently, there exist about 7,000 incubators worldwide,
among those, about 1,800 are in the USA, 900 in Europe, and many more
have emerged globally (Al-Mubaraki and Busler, 2014). Thus, the TBIs
have primarily sprung up during the past five decades and are gaining
more and more importance as a mechanism to promote technology-based
start-ups globally since then (Mian et al., 2016).

More recently, the digital economy has provided a new variant of TBI
mechanism, which is known as the accelerator, the first one being Y
Combinator of Massachusetts established in 2005. By 2013, there were
more than 213 accelerators operating across the world (Mian et al.,
2016). Further, although business incubators have been flourishing as
one of the most recognized tools of enterprise creation and development,
many different forms of private sector managed workspaces are emerging
to support the soft and hard elements of entrepreneurship across the
world (Fuzi, 2015). The most notable of them are co-working spaces,
which originated in San Francisco in 2005 and have grown rapidly in the
last five years (Leclercq-Vandelannoitte and Isaac, 2016). By 2015,
about 7,800 co-working spaces existed worldwide (Gerdenitsch et al.,
2016).

Methodology of the systematic literature review

To understand the research design and the process of the systematic
literature review, we studied the methodologies used in the past by
researchers (Schildt et al., 2006; Dahlander and Gann, 2010; Mian et
al., 2016) who have contributed to the review of literature related to
business incubators. Based on the above studies, we first identified the
search term to be used for our review. To begin with, our search term
was “technology incubator” or “business incubator” or “technology
business incubation” or “science park” or “technology park” or “research
park” or “technopole” or “business development center” or “technology
development center”. We did not use the word “accelerator” in the search
term because inclusion of this word provided us with a huge set of false
positives. A similar pattern related to false positives was observed by
Hausberg and Korreck (2018).

As the second step, we chose the review period from 1985 to 2018, based
on the prior studies (Mian et al., 2016) that noted that initial
articles related to business incubation originated in the mid-1980s. As
the third step, we had to make a choice on the databases to search for.
We began by using ISI Web of Science (WoS) database. However, we noted
that the review of search results in this database brought up many
articles unrelated to area of business incubation, and that the results
did not include contributions from the top 10 journals in
entrepreneurship and innovation fields as illustrated by Google Scholar.
We refined the results, and this cleansing led to a select list of 56
records.

Albort-Morant and Ribeiro-Soriano (2015) also had indicated that WoS may
not be the right source of database to search for literature for the
phenomenon of TBIs. Therefore, we included the Science Direct database
also in our search → which covered eight of the top 10 journals by
impact factor and citations. The first round of search in Science Direct
for the same terms returned a list of 23,400 records. Upon refining
these search results in a similar fashion as done with WoS, we obtained
a pruned list with an initial list of 968 records. We merged the two
lists (that of Science Direct and WoS) and removed the repeat
occurrences to obtain the final list of 884 records for the
co-authorship and co-occurrence reviews.

We used the VOSviewer software developed by Waltman and Van Eck (2012)
to conduct the co-authorship and co-occurrence reviews. This software
uses the techniques outlined by Cobo et al. (2011) to conduct the
bibliometric analysis. The software creates network maps, taking into
consideration most cited journals and keywords.

The top 10 journals that have published articles relevant to the
phenomenon of start-up creation through TBIs based on our search
criterion are presented in Figure 1.

The co-authorship analysis of the above records indicated that a total
of 1,450 authors had contributed to literature around TBI, and among
them, the top 10 authors are presented in Table I.

The co-occurrence analysis identified a total of 68 words that were
prominently used, which were grouped into eight clusters. These keywords
are presented as word cloud in Figure 2.

The co-authorship analysis helped in the identification of the key
contributors to the existing literature relevant to the topic of
examination in this study. However, the co-occurrence analysis indicated
the absence of a new start-up creation using TBIs as a mechanism. The
eight clusters that were the outcome of the co-occurrence analysis
indicated that topics such as innovation, technology transfer and
innovation policy have received attention from the relevant researchers
thus far. This observation led to further filtering of the records with
the aim to identify articles that addressed the aspect of start-up
creation with the support of TBIs.

In this round of filtering, all articles that did not directly address
the topic of start-up creation leveraging TBIs, across the eight
clusters, were excluded. As a result of these exclusion criteria,
articles related to innovation, science and technology policy and other
topics that were prominently identified in the co-occurrence analysis
were removed. This filtering procedure reduced the relevant articles to
158 records. A further filtering of these records by applying the
criteria to include articles from the top 10 journals and from highly
published authors, as revealed by the co-authorship analysis, led to the
selection of 71 articles for the literature review. Based on the
methodology to discover, verify and filter the contributions on TBIs to
start-up generation, four dominant themes related to the objective of
the study were discovered. The outcomes of the systematic literature
review are elaborated.

Literature review and analysis

The analysis of relevant literature indicates that TBIs vary in typology
and sponsors, goals and objectives, functions and services, incubation
processes, outcomes and achievements. An adequate understanding of these
issues is discussed to identify the research gaps on the basis of the
current state of knowledge.

TBIs: types and classifications

TBIs encompass independent organizations, and they can be examined from
different perspectives and at different levels and subjects of analysis
(Charry et al., 2014). TBIs have also evolved over time in response to
regional needs, technological changes and economic conditions (Caiazza,
2014). TBIs can be classified in terms of terminologies/titles used,
revenue orientation/strategic objective, location, origin, sponsor, etc.
TBIs are identified by different names across the world; most common
among them are “technology/business incubators”, “innovation/technology
centers,” “science/research/technology parks,” and “business/seed
accelerators” (Mian et al., 2016). These names also are indicative of
their key activities and depend on the location in which they are based.

The meaning of the term “incubator” applies to science, research and
technology parks that have earmarked physical location and
infrastructure to nurture entrepreneurship, and also to organizations
that do not possess any physical location but provide virtual services
(Lindelof and Loftsen, 2004). According to Bollingtoft and Ulhoi (2005),
TBIs are marketed under a variety of more or less synonymous symbols
such as business accelerators, research parks, knowledge parks,
seedbeds, industrial parks, technopoles and networked incubators. In the
Indian context, they include co-working spaces as well (Bala
Subrahmanya, 2017).

At the broadest level, TBIs can be classified in terms of their revenue
orientation or strategic objective: not for profit and for profit.
Not-for-profit TBIs are usually promoted by governments, universities,
local development bodies, and non-profit organizations, etc., whereas
for-profit TBIs are generally promoted by private sector entities
including corporate sector enterprises and private individuals (Von
Zedwitz and Grimaldi, 2006).

Aernoudt (2004) distinguished five different types of business
incubators on the basis of the key philosophy, objectives and their
sectorial focus. These five types of business incubators were regional
business incubator, university incubator, independent and commercial
incubator, company internal incubator and virtual incubator. Whereas the
regional business incubators and university incubators are
not-for-profit in nature, the independent commercial incubators and
company internal incubators are privately owned, and a virtual
incubator, which is for profit by nature, lacks a physical location and
offers online services.

Clarysse et al. (2005) classified the incubator models into three types
on the basis of the degree of complexity of activities performed and
diversity in approaches with respect to resource deployment. The low
selective model: the goal is creation of “as many start-ups as possible”
with a specific focus on any technology or any provision of funding to
start-ups. Supportive model: it restricts the number of start-ups it
selects for the program, but provides a wide and multi-disciplinary
service to the selected start-ups by way of IP support, negotiations on
patent and licensing and industry liaison, etc. Incubator model: it has
staff with deep expertise, provides access to private financial capital
and usually has a very narrow focus on a particular type of technology.

However, the most appealing classification of TBIs is made by tracing
their evolutions by Bruneel et al. (2012). The first generation of TBIs,
which originated in the 1950s but became widespread in the 1980s across
the world, provided subsidized and affordable office space along with
shared services and resources. Basic technology and physical
infrastructure is a function common to all types of TBIs and forms the
core value proposition (Bruneel et al., 2012). Infrastructure also
included laboratories and research equipment. The basic guiding
principle behind this model was economies of scale: the joint provision
of space and shared resources to multiple numbers of new ventures
resulted in economies of scale for them. The second phase of TBI
evolution started emerging in the 1980s in response to the increasing
unemployment problems in the mainstream sectors of automobiles and heavy
engineering in the USA and Europe. TBIs became a tool for promoting tech
start-ups, as a means of employment generation.

These tech start-ups were typically found to be lacking business
experience and marketing skills, which hampered their chances of
survival. TBIs responded to these needs of tech start-ups by providing
knowledge-based services as part of their value proposition. Thus, the
second-generation TBIs represented a lot more than just provision of
physical infrastructure to start-ups. The third-generation TBIs emerged
in the 1990s, with a focus on external networking for resources
comprising all key stakeholders for business sustenance. These included
potential customers, investors, suppliers and technology partners. This
resulted in the provision of institutionalized networks through TBIs to
the incubating ventures, which meant that networking no longer was
confined to or based on entrepreneurs’ personal networks and contacts.
The institutionalized networks enabled start-ups to overcome their
resource scarcity of various kinds and develop legitimacy faster than
otherwise (Bruneel et al., 2012).

Mian et al. (2016) distinguished the types of TBIs on the basis of the
support provided in different stages of start-up lifecycle of a
technology venture. There are TBIs in the form of science parks, which
provide support through the entire incubation continuum → germination
(pre-incubation), incubation and consolidation (post-incubation). But
there are TBIs in the form of innovation centers or academic incubators,
which provide support only for the pre-incubation/idea development phase
of the start-up lifecycle. Some technology parks or research parks
provide support primarily for incubation and acceleration, whereas
technopolis lends support for consolidation and growth in the
post-incubation period (Mian et al., 2016).

Thus, TBIs can be differentiated in terms of strategic objective for
revenue generation, sponsors, location, method of selection and focus of
support extended over the phase of a start-up lifecycle, period of
evolution, etc. A broad classification of TBIs is presented in Table II.
Given the different types of TBIs, with different strategic objectives,
different kinds of promoters, with different kinds of support offerings
in different phases of start-up lifecycle, it is appropriate to examine
their overall goals and via-media objectives.

TBIs: goals and objectives

Tavoletti (2013) contended that, in general, the goals of TBIs would
depend on their promoters or stakeholders. These stakeholders could be
from a university or from a public institution or an associate of a
private research lab, a private enterprise or an individual, etc. Even
if the stakeholders are similar, their goals can be different. At the
same time, Tavoletti (2013) assumed that the main stakeholder of TBIs
would comprise a regional or local policy maker whose primary agenda
would be to encourage sustainability of new enterprises and generation
of employment in the area, by creating new, high-growth based and
innovative technology-led ventures. To that extent, TBIs can be
considered an element of regional innovation infrastructure whose
special mission is to promote the development of innovation-based
start-ups (Rogova, 2014).

Thus, the major goal of TBIs is nurturing entrepreneurship for
successful venture creation for economic development (Thierstein and
Wilhelm, 2001). TBIs aim to create successful new ventures, which would,
in turn, create jobs and generate wealth in a given region, thereby
creating an attitude of innovation across the country as a whole (The
Centre for Internet and Society, 2015). This is done by enabling
knowledge transfer and providing services and resources, and correcting
for the shortage of resources that start-ups often have to deal with
(Porter and Kramer, 2011). The primary aim of TBIs is to promote
transfer of technology and diffusion of new products and services,
leading to the development of new local and innovative firms (EU, 2010).
Thus, TBIs ensure business stability through start-up survival and
growth, employment generation and economic growth (Schwartz and Hornych,
2008). This holds good for TBIs as far as they are publicly funded.
However, if they are privately funded organizations, the goal is to
generate profitable new ventures with the potential to achieve
accelerated growth, as quickly as possible.

Salvador and Rolfo (2011) contended that TBIs have two primary
objectives, namely to identify ventures that have great probability to
succeed but have resource constraints and to enable such ventures to
overcome the liability of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965) and the liability
of smallness (Freeman et al., 1983), resulting in the creation of
innovative firms that are competitive, profitable and sustainable.
Rasmussen et al. (2006) and Sithole and Rugimbana (2014) defined the
objective in the context of University TBIs as the commercialization of
research and technology by creating new firms that over time would
graduate into full-fledged businesses. In contrast, Özdemir and
Şehitoğlu (2013) contended that the primary objective of TBIs is to
support new ventures to survive in their initial years of operation and
help in the development of existing firms. But many researchers argued
that survivability of new ventures can only be a necessary condition,
and what is more important is their contribution to the growth of firms
and creation of jobs (Aerts et al., 2007). The ultimate goal of TBIs is
nurturing innovation and job creation leading to economic growth
(Özdemir and Şehitoğlu, 2013).

Thus, TBIs aim at accomplishing multiple objectives that include job
creation, fostering an entrepreneurial climate, reduction of firm
mortality rate and unemployment, commercialization of technology,
diversification, revitalizing and acceleration of growth of existing
industry and local economies, increase of university‒industry‒incubator
interaction and new technology development (Bizzotto, 2003; Mutambi et
al., 2010; Al-Mubaraki and Busler, 2011). The various goals and
objectives extracted from empirical literature are tabulated and
presented in the list below. Although there is considerable unanimity
among empirical researchers about the goal and objectives of TBIs, there
are differences in the way TBIs function and the services they provide
to promote start-ups. Therefore, it is pertinent to understand the way
TBIs function and the services they provide to the incubating ventures.

Goals and objectives of TBIs (source: empirical literature):

-   Goals:

2.  regional economic growth and development;

2.  fertile environment for innovation generation, commercialization and
      technology development; and

2.  fertile environment for technology entrepreneurship.

2.  Objectives:

2.  new venture creation (as healthy and as fast as possible);

2.  job generation;

2.  promotion of innovation and commercialization;

-   technology development and transfer;

2.  income and wealth creation;

2.  export promotion;

2.  university‒industry interaction;

2.  reduction of unemployment rate and firm mortality rate; and

2.  firm growth and industry growth.

TBIs: functions and services

The major function of a TBI is to enable the entrepreneurs to develop
their ideas starting from ideation to inception and then to
commercialization and formal creation of a new venture (Caiazza, 2014).
TBIs enable knowledge transfer and provide services and resources toward
new venture creation (Albort-Morant and Oghazi, 2016). Despite all the
differences in the terminologies used, in terms of location, ownership
structure, etc., a function commonly shared by all kinds of TBIs is that
they create an enabling environment to new and small ventures to help
them to overcome the difficulties that exist in the initial stages, and
later, survive and grow to become successful mature businesses (Özdemir
and Şehitoğlu, 2013).

TBI is an intermediate organization in an entrepreneurial value chain
whose main function is to provide a social environment, technological
and organizational resources and managerial expertise for the
transformation of a technology-based business idea into an efficient
economic organization (Phan et al., 2005). Thus, the primary function of
TBIs is to enable commercialization of new technologies through
supporting innovative entrepreneurial ventures, as they provide social,
technological, managerial and financial resources for the start-up phase
of a new venture that transform a technology-based new idea into an
innovative firm (Corsi and Berardino, 2014).

Given this, some of the common services rendered by TBIs are provision
of physical office, equipment and space at affordable and subsidized
rates, basic shared business and office support services at minimal
costs, provision of technical, business and legal support besides
technical mentoring and financial support (Bruneel et al., 2012;
Grimaldi and Grandi, 2005). Most TBIs offer managerial and
administrative assistance as well as physical infrastructure to their
tenants. Thus, TBIs are primarily property-based initiatives, and their
main functions are providing their occupants with a range of services
that include infrastructure provision, networking and provision of
business support services (Bergek and Norrman, 2008). Alongside the
provision of services portfolio, business incubation also calls for a
“proper selection criteria” and exit policies to be incorporated (Aerts
et al., 2007). Further, TBIs focus on meeting a new venture’s early
needs in its lifecycle.

An important function of a TBI is to enable timely graduation of its
tenants (Rothaermel and Thursby, 2005). If this has to happen, TBIs must
combine infrastructure with business support and provision of access to
networks to its incubating ventures, but not all TBIs would be able to
do this because various factors might limit them to confine themselves
to a mere provision of infrastructure (Bruneel et al., 2012). But,
Pettersen et al. (2016) argued that a TBI is an entity with specialized
infrastructure that is exclusively intended to nurture innovative
start-ups by providing critical resources as required by them to enable
their survival and growth. Given this, although TBIs can provide
incubating firms with exclusive resources such as office space, business
and technical counseling and other support services, their more
important function should be to stimulate internal networking, and
exchange of knowledge between incubating firms (Kitagawa and Robertson,
2012; Sa and Lee, 2012).

In addition, TBIs should help start-ups to develop and nurture
relationship with external companies, MNCs, large enterprises and other
individuals (Vanderstraeten et al., 2016). This was reiterated by Bergek
and Norrman (2008) when they defined the functions and services of TBIs
as to provide shared office space, which is rented under more or less
favorable conditions to incubatees, a pool of shared support services to
reduce overhead costs, professional business support or advice
(mentoring) and network opportunities, internal and/or external.
Similarly, Carayannis and Zedtwitz (2005) described five services to be
central to a TBI: provision and access to physical office resources such
as office space, operational furniture, computer network, etc., basic
office support such as provision of mail, fax and copying services, and
book-keeping, etc., ability to connect to financial resources such as
business angels and venture capitalists, provision of entrepreneurial
start-up support such as business plan, legal/accounting advice, etc.,
and access to networks.

Network relationships play critical roles as the means of learning to
acquire multiple resources such as obtaining customers and understanding
their needs, access to finance, contacts to mentors, which will enable
an entrepreneur to shorten and accelerate a firm’s learning processes
(Zahra, 2005). An incubating venture would benefit from the incubator’s
extensive network comprising its staff and advisory board, local
universities, industry contacts, consultants, and venture and angel
investors, as well as networking with other incubatees (Hackett and
Dilts, 2004a).

This is especially valuable for start-ups that are in their pursuit of
firm emergence, survival and growth (Schutjens and Stam, 2003). The
diversity of networks is more important than the network size, as the
network heterogeneity enables tech start-ups to grow and succeed (Baum
et al., 2000). Therefore, one of the core functions of TBIs is to
provide opportunities for networking, thereby enabling their tenants to
establish mutually beneficial relationships with external agents or
enterprises (Sa and Lee, 2012). A summary of empirical literature-based
functions and services offered by TBIs is presented in the list below.

Functions and services of TBIs (source: empirical literature):

-   Functions:

-   help prospective entrepreneurs to promote their ideas from ideation
    to inception and then to commercialization and the creation of a new
    venture;

1.  facilitate transformation of a technology-based business idea into
    an efficient economic organization;

1.  link technology, capital and know-how in order to leverage
    entrepreneurial talent, accelerate the development of new ventures,
    and thus speed up the exploitation of technology; and

1.  enable timely graduation of its tenants.

1.  Services:

-   shared physical office space at affordable and subsidized rates;

1.  common infrastructure services support and office equipment
    provision at a minimal cost;

1.  business, technical and legal assistance, and access to funding
    sources;

1.  promote (internal) networking among incubating ventures; and

1.  provide access to TBI’s external networks.

TBI-led process of business incubation

There could be various factors such as TBIs’ age, size, facilities
provided, network opportunities facilitated, local environment, etc.,
which have an influence on the outcomes of any incubation program, but
it is the incubation process or practice pursued by TBIs that is the
most critical determinant of their success (Lockett and Wright, 2005;
Ayatse et al., 2017). The program of business incubation, devised as a
tool of spurring innovation, job creation and economic development, is
designed to add value to new ventures to increase the survival rates.
The value-adding activities for incubating firms are generally
considered the business incubation process (Ayatse et al., 2017).

Campbell et al. (1985) were among the first few scholars to
conceptualize a process model for business incubation. They identified
four key or basic services or value-adding activities, which have a
bearing on firm formation and success in a TBI. The whole process begins
with a diagnosis of needs for the new ventures that have sought
admission into an incubator with their business proposals. When the
diagnosis results in shortlisting of a new innovative venture for
incubation, the monitoring of such new ventures (incubator tenants)
starts. The incubator tenants enjoy access to common business and
professional services and, in addition, value-adding activities through
access to finance, expert networks for market identification and advice.
The tenants that leverage these services and activities successfully
will formally graduate from the incubation program as sustaining and
established growth ventures (Ayatse et al., 2017). But the major fallacy
in the model is the underlying assumption that almost all of the
incubated start-ups would survive. Further, the proposed model has not
taken into account the role of entrepreneurial capability, ecosystem
strengths and shortcomings and the adopted selection criteria.

The model of incubation process developed by Smilor and Gill (1986) laid
more emphasis on external agents and support systems relative to the
internal processes and activities of an incubator. An incubator is a
mechanism and system that provides structure and stability to new
ventures chosen for incubation while providing access to a group of
common shared resources. It is the combination of internal support
services and external networks that enable venture formation and
emergence to achieve the larger objectives of technology development for
new products, viable new ventures, job creation and economic growth.

An incubation process developed by Hackett and Dilts (2004b) primarily
deals with its internal mechanisms and activities, with an external link
to its regional environment. Their incubation model and incubation
process begin with the selection of incubatees from a group of potential
new venture applicants, who then become the incumbent tenants or
participants for incubation. The incubating ventures are made to undergo
various activities that enhance their prospects in three ways: selection
performance (which refers to the selection of incubatees, which are
prospective firms that exhibit potential to excel), monitoring and
provision of business assistance, and resource munificence (providing
requisite resources to help the incubating firms to develop and
graduate). The incubated ventures then emerge from the incubation
process as newly graduated firms with a tangible economic outcome, which
can be qualified as being successful or failure. Thus, Hackett and Dilts
(2004b) considered the possibilities of success and failure of an
incubated venture as an outcome of the incubation process.

However, Hackett and Dilts (2004b) felt that much attention of empirical
research on TBIs has been conferred on the description of facilities
provided or available at the incubator, whereas scant attention has been
paid to the incumbent incubatees, the new ideas that they seek to
commercialize, the technological innovations they seek to proliferate
into the market, and the tangible outcomes that have been achieved.

Whereas some of the science parks support all the three phases of
incubation continuum, many of the facilities do not. This diversity in
the support extended often leads to inconsistent definitions, as well as
different criteria for evaluating effectiveness create challenges in the
determination of value addition by the TBIs and do not provide a
comparable baseline for comparison of key success factors across TBIs
(Albort-Morant and Ribeiro-Soriano, 2015). These stated differences in
structure and operational objectives have been the primary cause for the
lack of formulation of a unified and agreeable conceptual or theoretical
framework for TBI research.

There is no unanimous understanding with regard to the process of
business incubation. This could be largely due to idiosyncrasies of
different forms of TBIs such as science parks, incubators, accelerators,
technology parks, innovation centers, etc., with respect to the
geographic, social, political, cultural and economic systems (Phan et
al., 2005). However, the broad stages of business incubation as derived
from empirical literature are given in the list below. Despite the lack
of unanimous description and understanding of what contains “business
incubation process,” empirical researchers have attempted to assess the
outcomes and achievements of TBIs in diverse ways. It is essential to
understand the varied ways of TBI performance assessment made in
empirical research.

TBI-led incubation process (source: empirical literature):

-   scrutiny of applications/ideas submitted by prospective start-up
    founders for matchmaking;

1.  admission of shortlisted prospective start-up founders to the TBI;

1.  provision of space, access to common infrastructure and services;

1.  provision of legal, technical advice (internal/external) for
    facilitating ideation, POC and prototype development for a minimum
    viable product (MVP);

1.  provision of business advice (internal/external) for market
    identification;

1.  provision of seed funds and link with (external) angels or
    early-stage venture capital funds;

1.  product generation and linking with early product adopters; and

1.  new venture graduation.

TBIs: performance assessment in terms of outcomes and achievements

The performance assessment of TBIs in terms of outcomes and achievements
has to be done with respect to their stakeholders, goals and objectives,
but incubation process would be its major determinant. The available
studies are heterogeneous, as they have used many methodological
approaches focusing on diverse set of measures. Further, whereas a few
have assessed the impact of TBIs at the individual firm level, others
have estimated the impact at a macroeconomic level (Hausberg and
Korreck, 2018). Most of the empirical studies conducted so far are based
on case studies, which are largely considered theoretical, and the
analysis of data collected on the basis of perception from a small
number of incubators is inappropriate (Barbero et al., 2012). Aernoudt
(2004) pointed out that TBIs in the world are of uneven quality, and
their evaluation must take into account differences in the archetype of
TBIs, as they have different missions. TBIs with different stakeholders
and different incubation models produce different outcomes and
performances, and therefore different evaluations of effectiveness is
essential.

Even if the stakeholders are similar, their goals can be different.
Therefore, measuring outcomes without putting them in relation to
different stakeholders and their different goals is meaningless
(Tavoletti, 2013). Although there are several empirical studies on the
performance of TBIs, no single standard method that is universally
acceptable has emerged to measure the incubation performance and make
comparisons (Phan et al., 2005; Özdemir and Şehitoğlu, 2013). This is
due to the definitional challenge of what incubators are as much as due
to a lack of consensus among researchers on what measures can be
constituted for incubator performance (Ayatse et al., 2017).

The problem gets compounded, as the objectives of TBIs and direct
tangible performance indicators of these entities are very difficult to
obtain (Barbero et al., 2012). Therefore, TBI performance measure has
become one of the most controversial issues among empirical researchers
(Barbero et al., 2012). As a result, in the business incubation
literature, different kinds of performance-based indices are used,
belonging to different functional areas of the incubation processes such
as finance, amount of venture capital funds raised, revenue generation,
number of start-ups graduated from TBIs, measurement of firm survival,
degree of networking activity, level of innovation carried out in the
incumbent firms, measures of firm growth, contribution to job creation,
sales growth, gross profitability, number of patents granted or patent
applications filed, technology transfer details if any, employment
growth internal to the incumbent start-up, technology development
measures and/or R&D productivity and high-tech employment (Ayatse et
al., 2017).

A more acceptable way of TBI performance assessment may be done in terms
of immediate outcomes in the form of success or failure of incubated
ventures after graduation, the number of jobs created and income
generated by the successfully emerged new ventures and its larger impact
on the regional economy. In this regard, Hackett and Dilts (2004b) were
of the view that performance of TBIs is possible by examining five
different and mutually exclusive outcomes at the time of completion of
the incubation process, namely the incubatee has survived and is growing
profitably; the incubatee has survived and is growing and is on a path
toward profitability; the incubatee has survived but is not growing and
is not profitable or marginally profitable; the operations of the
incubatee were terminated while still in the incubator; however, losses
were minimized, and the operations of the incubatee were terminated
while still in the incubator, but the losses were large.

Whereas the first three would indicate success measures of incubation,
the last two measures indicate incubation failure. Certainly, the first
three indicate only a snapshot or a cursory overview of the performance
of incubatees on the “graduation day,” and they are not a guarantee of
any future success or failure. A similar measurement model for TBI
performance assessment was proposed by Al-Mubaraki and Busler (2011),
with the following four indicators: graduation of business incubated,
success of business incubated, jobs created by incubation and salaries
paid by incubator clients.

In summary, the assessment of incubator performance should be done
taking into account all the related outcomes. For empirical research
involving a larger sample size, it would be appropriate to use a group
of indicators relevant to the study objectives that would then
facilitate analysis and help in arriving at accurate conclusions.
Accordingly, Barbero et al. (2012) used a set of indicators, based on
what was proposed in literature for R&D measures. The output R&D
measures that were used were sales and employment growth, number of
patents created or filed and number of new and innovative products and
services introduced. The input R&D measures included QSEs calculated as
a percent of total employees, total R&D investment as a percent of
sales, the contribution to R&D programs as a percent of sales and cost
incurred per job.

By and large, empirical literature has revealed that incubation has a
significant impact on the business performance of incubated start-ups
with the outcome depicting either a positive or a negative relationship
in the form of determination of venture survival/failure, generation of
sales/revenue growth, creation of employment, attainment of venture
funding/capital and quality and quantity of networking/alliance as the
business performance indicators. Some of the other measures, such as
technology development and transfer, number of patents applied and
obtained, R&D intensity and R&D productivity are among the less
frequently used measures of incubation performance (Ayatse et al.,
2017). The incubation performance is measured to assess the impact of
incubation process defined in terms of selection process of incubatees,
the provision of business support and assistance, provision of
professional support services and capital to incubatees and allowing
them to utilize networks within the incubator as well as its external
networks (Grimaldi et al., 2011; Ayatse et al., 2017).

The above-mentioned overall discussion throws light on the typology and
sponsors of TBIs, their goals and objectives, functions and services,
process of incubation and outcomes and achievements of the incubation
process based on empirical research findings in diverse contexts.
Although there is a wide divergence in the typology and sponsors,
services rendered and therefore process of incubation leading to
different outcomes and achievements, there is convergence as well with
respect to the key objectives of a TBI in the form of facilitating or
nurturing technology-based new ventures, for their successful emergence
and growth as “healthily and quickly” as possible. A consistent
emergence of successful technology start-ups and their growth would
invariably result in new products and services, possibly through
commercialization of innovations and technology transfer, more
employment generation, income creation, sales growth, possibly, patent
generation, with an overall positive impact on regional economic growth.
The broad indicators of TBI performance in terms of
outcomes/achievements are presented in the list below.

TBI performance assessment: outcomes and achievements.

Outcomes/achievements (source: empirical literature):

-   success or failure of incubated start-ups to emerge;

1.  success or failure to develop/exploit internal and/or external
    networking;

1.  success or failure to generate jobs;

1.  success or failure to generate revenue;

1.  success or failure to introduce new products/services;

1.  success or failure to generate innovations and its commercialization
    for new venture creation;

1.  success or failure to develop new technologies for transfer;

1.  success or failure to obtain patents;

1.  success or failure to contribute in terms of R&D inputs and R&D
    output;

1.  success or failure of emerged start-ups to sustain and grow;

1.  success or failure to contribute to exports;

1.  success or failure to reduce firm failure rate and unemployment
    rate; and

1.  success or failure to contribute to regional economic growth.

In the context of above literature discussion, we attempt to examine key
theoretical contributions relevant in the sphere of technology business
incubation, to conceptualize TBIs in terms of determinants of the
incubation process and its cumulative impact on incubation outcomes
resulting in new venture generation and growth. Subsequently, we propose
a conceptual framework, linking sponsors, objectives, services,
incubation process and achievements of TBIs.

Technology business incubation for new venture creation: a theoretical
perspective

TBIs that originated in the USA in the 1950s have increasingly
proliferated all over the world since then, across developed as well as
emerging and developing economies, as a means of promoting
technology-based start-ups. Accordingly, it is argued that they have
played an important role in hatching start-ups, especially in
high-technology sectors (Azriel and Laric, 2008). The strongest argument
in the promotion of TBIs is that the incubation process undergone by the
prospective start-up founders due to the incubation process produces a
synergistic effect on the economic value that results from start-up
creations. A steady increase in the emergence of successful start-ups
will cumulatively contribute to regional economic development through
job creation and income generation.

However, the core issue to be theorized is how incubation helps the
creation of successful start-ups, leading to multiple benefits and
thereby benefiting regional economies. The key challenge for theorizing
technology business incubation is providing a logical explanation on the
dynamics of the factors of incubation process, explaining how and why
these factors come together and foster incubatee success or failure in
the early stages of new venture development (Hackett and Dilts, 2004b).
Obviously, such a theory must focus on pre-incubation, incubation and
post-incubation stages, covering both incubatees and TBIs, as these are
the three critical stages of new venture development (Table III).
Different theoretical propositions have been applied in empirical
research to logically explain the incubation process and its overall
outcomes, but with little unanimity. A brief reference to some of these
theoretical attempts is in order.

One of the widely referred theories is an option-driven theory, derived
from the domain of finance and investments for business incubation, by
Hackett and Dilts (2004a). When an initial investment decision is made,
an option is created, which is followed by subsequent investment
decisions to be made in successive stages (Rosenberger, 2003). Option
creation and subsequent incrementally staged investments (option
exercises) confer on an investor future decision rights, preferential
access to opportunities, access to a potentially valuable upside,
ability to contain downside risk by limiting the cost of failure to the
sunk cost of constructing the option, minus any remaining option value
(Hackett and Dilts, 2004a).

The selection of an incubatee/s from a multiple number of applicants for
incubation in a TBI is the creation of an option, and this is followed
by a subsequent infusion of resources and provision of facilities
coupled with monitoring, advice and assistance, for incubating tenants,
which are considered option exercises. These two together would
determine the outcome of technology business incubation in the form of
emergence or non-emergence of successful start-ups. The population size
of regions, the current status of the economy, size of the incubator and
the level of inclusive development would be the control variables
(Hackett and Dilts, 2004a).

However, in the above theory, it is not made clear how the three
explanatory variables are measured. Further, the theory was not able to
throw any light on the influence of quantity and quality of
knowledge/networks, etc., which an incubator has on incubation outcomes
(Azriel and Laric, 2008).

An alternative theory proposed for business incubation focuses on the
function of networking and social interaction in incubators, using
network theory or social capital theory. Many empirical studies
underlined networking services of TBIs as the most important tenet of
the incubation process (Sungur, 2015). The core elements of a network
are the nodes and ties that connect these nodes. Nodes are typically
defined at different organizational levels such as industry, university
and government, whereas ties usually depict the relational
characteristics including friendship, exchange of advice, assets and
information, cooperation and power. There could be multiple
relationships or ties connecting different nodes.

The basic argument is that TBIs help incubatees to form and develop
their networks within the incubator as well as externally, and the
networks developed by an incubatee due to an incubator influence
start-up formation and graduation, and thereby performance of a TBI
(Eveleens et al., 2017). An incubatee may have its own network of
resources acquired through modes of education and/or work experience
that are valuable in the critical phase of start-up formation. These are
called “private” external networks, acquired mainly through the
start-ups’ own efforts, which are labeled as “idiosyncratic,” as they
are unique to an incubatee and they satisfy the specific needs of that
start-up (Pettersen et al., 2016). A prospective start-up while
undergoing incubation in a TBI would make use of networks that the TBI
provides in the form of access to resources and capabilities, knowledge
and learning, and social capital, to complement with its own.

However, empirical studies that made use of social network theory for
business incubation have simply assumed that an increase in the
“intermediary benefits” will automatically translate to better start-up
performance, but without adequate empirical substantiation (Eveleens et
al., 2017). Further, social network theory does not elaborate on what
kinds of prospective start-ups are able to develop effective and
productive networks by making use of TBI support. Similarly, it does not
reveal what kinds of TBI attributes favor or hinder its incubatees to
form and develop networks, to complement with its own networks for
successful start-up graduation and exit (Ahmad, 2014).

The RBV theory has extensively been adopted to examine firm-level
attributes under different concepts that include resources,
capabilities, and strategies that are crucial for determining firm
performance and competitive advantage. The RBV theory views a firm as a
bundle of resources and capabilities that have a profound influence on
its performance (Barney, 1991; M’Chirgui, 2012).

Many researchers have adopted this theory to describe the role of TBIs
in firm creation and promotion (Ahmad, 2014). These researchers have
viewed incubation as a mechanism of rewarding a bundle of tangible and
intangible resources to incubatees that result in venture formation, in
addition to other benefits. Whereas tangible resources would include
infrastructure including labs and equipment, common facilities, etc.,
intangible resources would comprise monitoring and advice, opportunities
for networking with other incubatees, links to TBI’s external networks
comprising technology and business mentors, angels and VCs,
universities, large firms, etc. These resources provide the incubatees
access to new knowledge, expertise and networks, in addition to their
own, which enable firm formation and graduation (Ahmad, 2014). Thus, in
the context of these TBIs, RBV theory implies that TBI resources offered
to its incubatees enable them to acquire superior competitive advantage
for successful firm formation and emergence, and therefore can be
counted as an important factor in determining the success of TBIs
(Somsuk and Laosirihongthong, 2014).

However, the application of RBV theory to TBI mechanism has lacunae, as
it does not throw light on an incubatee’s capacity and willingness to
absorb the TBI resources and networks as well as internal environment of
a TBI including the relationship between incubatees and incubator
management, among others (Ahmad, 2014). Further, its primary focus is on
the incubation process, but not on the pre-incubation and
post-incubation phases of venture formation, which are equally crucial.

Technology business incubation: a conceptual framework

It is against the above-mentioned backdrop that we propose a conceptual
framework for technology business incubation comprising pre-incubation,
incubation and post-incubation phases of start-up development involving
both TBIs and prospective start-ups that undergo incubation, subsequent
to its selection for graduation and exit, which is presented in Figure
3.

Pre-incubation phase

In the pre-incubation phase, a TBI has to take a crucial decision in
terms of choosing among the various applicants (prospective start-ups)
who have submitted applications to a TBI seeking admission for
incubation. This is a matchmaking process. This has two dimensions:
demand side and supply side. The demand side is represented by the TBIs
that look for quality proposals, which would meet their objectives,
appropriate to their functions and services, so that they can optimally
render their incubation process through appropriate monitoring and
guidance, to reap the best benefits possible (in terms of start-up
graduation and exit). The nature of sponsors of TBIs (in the form of
government, university, corporate or private), their sector focus and
external networks would also matter in the selection process.

The supply side is represented by the various prospective start-ups that
approach the TBIs for seeking admission for incubation. The prospective
start-up founder/s have to assess their appropriateness to a particular
TBI (in terms of nature of sponsor and sector focus), before submitting
their application/s.

Matchmaking: once the applications are submitted, a TBI would look at
the technology and market potential of a proposal, and its promoters, in
terms of their education and industry work/previous start-up founding
experience, domain expertise, and their current network resources. The
extent of complementarity between the TBI and the prospective start-up
founders, and the former’s assessment of capability of both to
contribute to start-up formation through the incubation process would
play a decisive role in the selection of a start-up proposal for
subsequent incubation.

Incubation phase

The incubation process would begin with providing shared space, access
to common infrastructure, common service facilities, and common advisory
services such as legal, administrative and financial, etc. This will be
followed by the promotion of internal networking among the incubatees,
by conducting periodical interactive meetings. The continuous monitoring
and interaction between the incubation management and the incubating
start-ups would enable both to look for and exploit appropriate external
networks to complement with the latter’s own networks, to achieve the
following: identifying and linking with suitable technology mentors to
move from ideation to proof of concept and further to prototype
development, followed by a MVP; identifying and accessing early product
markets through business mentors; identifying and accessing angel
investors or early-stage venture capitalists for financing early-stage
production operations; identifying and accessing key human resources,
wherever necessary.

Thus, the four functional management inputs are facilitated to converge
for start-up formation. The time taken for its successful convergence
would depend on the quality and efficacy of TBI infrastructure, services
and internal networking, as much as that of external networking, and the
complementarity of both with the incubating start-up’s own networks. The
efficiency of incubation management as well as that of start-up
founder/s will have an overall decisive role.

Post-incubation phase

The start-up formation with well-defined new products and repeatable
production clearly identified target markets, with adequate human
resources and early-stage finance, thereby marking its readiness for
graduation and exit. Such start-ups would have generated revenue as well
as contributed in terms of R&D inputs and R&D output. Such start-ups
would have acquired and exhibited potential to generate more jobs and
revenue through further market penetration for sustenance and subsequent
growth. This marks the end of overall process of new venture development
or start-up formation, thereby ceasing the venture formation
responsibility of a TBI.

Technology business incubation for start-up generation: future research
agenda

The conceptual framework developed as the outcome of the systematic
literature review can be helpful in defining the future research agenda
on technology business incubation for start-up formation, which can be
broadly summarized as follows:

-   Pre-incubation process comprising demand and supply factors, leading
    to the selection of incubatees by a TBI, can have a decisive
    influence as much as the incubation process itself on the outcome of
    incubation, irrespective of a TBI’s sponsors, objectives, structure,
    and resources. Therefore, future research should focus on the
    pre-incubation process as much as on the incubation process to
    understand the determinants of incubation outcomes or TBI
    performance.

1.  The matchmaking process for the selection of incubatees at the TBI
    level is hardly examined and understood. The effectiveness of
    matchmaking process would depend on the strength and competence of
    TBI management, which, in turn, would influence TBI performance and
    infant start-up achievements. This is another prospective area for
    future research.

1.  The extent of blend and complementarity of strength and resources of
    selected incubatees with that of the TBI is another major
    determining factor of TBI performance as much as graduated start-up
    performance. Examining and measuring the blend and complementarity
    between the two is another major research issue to be examined.

1.  How “exhaustive and complete” are the support services offered by a
    TBI so as to enable prospective start-up founders to combine the
    four functional areas, namely, technology for production, marketing,
    finance and human resources for start-up formation and graduation?
    This is another pertinent research issue that requires exploration.

1.  What determines the time and duration of start-up formation in a
    TBI, given its resources and infrastructure? Are “idiosyncratic
    networks” of incubatees crucial for their success relative to the
    network resources of TBIs? How do these networks influence the time
    taken for start-up formation? This would reveal the critical role of
    networks in the incubation process of TBIs.

1.  How do TBIs strengthen the “Regional Innovation Systems” or the
    “National Innovation Systems” through R&D contributions from
    incubated and graduated start-ups?

1.  How to meaningfully assess the economic contributions of TBIs, when
    they are supported by public policies and regional/national
    governments?

1.  What are the key performance indicators of TBIs, which can form the
    basis for benchmarking for future TBI evaluation?

1.  Would it be feasible to define a “viable new venture incubation
    framework” for start-up formation through TBIs? How to create one
    and what should be its critical structure and components? Is there a
    new theoretical lens that can be applied from other domains to
    explain this phenomenon?

Conclusions

TBIs form an indispensable component of an entrepreneurial ecosystem for
the promotion of tech start-ups and are emerging rapidly across the
global economy, since their origin in the USA dates back to the 1950s.
However, they have evolved in varied forms over a period of time, in
terms of types and variety, sponsors and stakeholders, locations and
regions, goals and objectives, functions and services offered, process
of incubation support provided through hard and soft infrastructure, and
outcomes and achievements. It is against this backdrop that we have
reviewed extant empirical literature in a systematic manner to throw
light on the various dimensions of TBIs, beginning from typology
comprising classifications of TBIs, identifying their key goals and
objectives, describing their functions and services, revealing their
incubation processes and examining their diverse possible outcomes and
achievements.

Subsequently, we reviewed some of the key theories adapted as the basis
of describing technology business incubation for new venture creation.
Finally, based on comprehensive literature understanding and select
theoretical attempts on technology business incubation for new venture
formation, we proposed a conceptual framework comprising pre-incubation,
incubation and post-incubation stages of start-up formation and
graduation. The conceptual framework has attempted to capture minute and
critical issues concerning start-up formation and graduation. The
pre-incubation phase focussed on the role of demand-side as well as
supply-side factors involved in matchmaking for the selection of
incubatees. The incubation phase covered both hard and soft
infrastructure support required within a TBI to bring together
technology development for product formation, market identification,
accessing finance and acquiring human resources for start-up formation.
The post-incubation phase emphasized on the critical indicators that
could be used for judiciously deciding on the graduation of an
incubating start-up.

This conceptual framework can be helpful in defining the future research
agenda on technology business incubation for start-up formation. The key
strands of future research areas that have been outlined after the
conceptual framework provide immense opportunities for academics and
practitioners to add new knowledge in this domain. Further, case
studies, studies of applicability of this framework at regional and
national levels have the potential to produce new insights.

For policy makers, the systematic literature review and the subsequent
conceptual model will provide a useful framework to base their
policy-making decisions. Policy makers can prioritize the promotion of
enabling factors or reduction of barriers of the key elements identified
in the framework in order to spur start-up generation by means of TBIs.
This framework can also serve as a useful guide to plan for the creation
of new TBIs and to formulate the outputs based on regional/local
factors.

In summary, the above proposed agenda for future research and the
conceptual framework for start-up generation through TBIs have the
potential to improve the effectiveness and efficacy of technology
business incubation, thereby facilitating technology business incubation
promotion through appropriate interventions by policy makers as much as
by corporate enterprises.

Highlight: Against many expectations, 2021 saw most airlines survive
amid a rise of new rivals and stalled consolidation moves

Body

One of the most counter-intuitive things about the pandemic for the
airline sector has been that during the worst crisis the industry has
ever faced, relatively few carriers have collapsed.

The safety blankets governments wrapped around their national carriers,
together with the focus airlines have had on securing liquidity, have
largely ensured operators have been able to survive the crisis. Where
such support was not available, airlines have embarked on formal
restructurings to gain the necessary breathing space.

Yet such has been the levels of network cuts and restructuring during
the crisis, that the door has been left open for new entrants. While the
pandemic has lowered some of the barriers to entry, namely accessing
markets and resources, in most instances the new players were already
projects in development, or emerged as direct replacements for failed
operators.

Farewell Alitalia?

The biggest airline failure and start-up during 2021 is one such
example. In October Alitalia finally took its final drink in the
last-chance saloon, to be replaced by ITA Airways.

Alitalia had spent much of the last decade struggling for sustainability
since it last needed restructuring. Having relaunched in 2009 as a
privately-owned carrier merged with Air One and with Air France-KLM as a
strategic investor, it later ran aground when Etihad called time on its
attempt to revamp the Italian carrier.

The airline’s challenges were underscored by it spending its last four
years in administration, failing to secure new investment even before
the pandemic rocked the airline sector.

Alitalia ceased flights on 15 October and was immediately replaced by
ITA Airways. The latter marked a new slimmed down national carrier,
complete with ambitions to reach breakeven by the third quarter of 2023
and to completely revamp its fleet with new Airbus aircraft. It had by
the end of October joined SkyTeam, the global alliance Alitalia had been
in for the last 20 years.

Crucially, European regulators ruled that Italy had demonstrated “a
clear break” between Alitalia and ITA, and was also acting as a private
investor in providing €1.35 billion ($1.53 billion) in capital
injections over the next three years. It did though attach a number of
conditions restricting the scope of ITA’s activities.

While ITA secured breathing space from European regulators, low-cost
carriers – which did so much to keep the pressure on Alitalia over the
last two decades – have further stepped up their presence in Italian
markets during the pandemic.

Alitalia’s suspension of flights came after 70 years of operations. The
brand itself could yet reappear, after ITA acquired the Alitalia name in
October from administrators. ITA initially said this was a defensive
move to prevent others utilising the brand, but indications are that the
Alitalia name might be revived.

Likewise, the focus for many other new launches in Europe has been
seeking to fill a gap left by a fallen operator. That is evident in
Ireland, where Aer Lingus franchise carrier Stobart Air was forced to
pull the plug on operations in June after the collapse of a proposed
acquisition of the airline.

Stobart Group had been seeking a buyer for the regional carrier after it
had itself in 2020 bought the operator back from Connect Airways
administrators as a means of managing outstanding financial commitments.

However, it subsequently faced a further blow when Aer Lingus, for whom
it had been operating flights as Aer Lingus Regional under a long-term
franchise, awarded a new 10-year deal beginning in 2023 to Irish
start-up Emerald Airlines.

The latter carrier is run by Dublin Aerospace executive chairman Conor
McCarthy, the former Ryanair executive who was a co-founder of AirAsia,
and who began his career as chief executive of Aer Lingus Commuter.
Emerald, which will operate ATR turboprops, has now agreed to bring
forward the launch of operations by nearly 10 months to March 2022.

Air Montenegro, which launched scheduled flights in June 2021, was a
successor carrier to replace Montenegro Airlines. The latter had been
forced to suspend operations on 26 December 2020 after the government
ruled out further support for the debt-ridden airline.

The launch in June of Icelandic airline Play also had its origins in
replacing a previous operator. The airline is following the playbook –
the early chapters at least – of Wow Air. The Icelandic carrier had
developed a niche linking low-cost services from Reykjavik to European
and US east coast destinations.

Play employs a similar initial network and fleet as Wow, and features a
number of former executives from the airline. Chief executive Birgir
Jonsson, who had a year at Wow but was a ­relatively latecomer to the
project, points to the success of the Wow model before it over-expanded
its fleet and network.

Since launching on European routes in the summer, Play has detailed
plans to begin transatlantic flights in spring 2022, serving Baltimore
and Boston.

What casualties there have been in the US market have largely been among
regional airlines. One such operator, ExpressJet Airlines, which ceased
operations in 2020, resumed flying in October 2021, operating
leisure-focused routes in the western USA under the brand Aha.

revival plans

Moves are also underway to revive operations of two of the biggest
airline casualties of recent years: Flybe and Jet Airways.

While the pandemic proved the final straw for Flybe, the UK regional
carrier was already on the brink of failure. Plans for a resurrected
operation moved closer in November when the successor carrier took
delivery of its first aircraft. The De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400
twin-turboprop, leased from Nordic Aviation Capital, was in service with
the previous iteration of Flybe from 2007 until the carrier ceased
operations in early 2020.

Flybe plans to launch flights early in 2022 from Birmingham.

Indian carrier Jet Airways was the biggest airline collapse of 2019.
Since suspending operations in the spring of that year, there has been
constant talk of restoring operations. That moved closer to fruition
when a resolution plan from the Jalan-Kalrock consortium received court
approval in June. The airline has indicated plans to restart operations
in the first quarter of 2022 and has also said it is in talks with
Airbus and Boeing about a major aircraft order.

Moves are also reportedly also under way for Mexican low-cost operator
Interjet to return to the skies in 2022. The airline suspended flights
in late 2020.

Even within an airline group, start-up moves are sometimes driven by
replacing lost capacity. In the UK, for example, British Airways’ plans
for a new lower-cost subsidiary to be called BA Euroflyer, which it aims
to launch in the summer of 2022, are a means of finding a more
sustainable way of restoring short-haul flights from London Gatwick.

Breezing in

Probably the highest profile launch during 2021 was David Neeleman’s
Breeze Airways. Plans for the US start-up first emerged in the summer of
2018, including an order at that year’s Farnborough air show for Airbus
A220s. Despite the ­obvious ­challenges presented by the ­pandemic,
Neeleman launched Breeze – his fifth airline – in late May 2021.

Breeze launched using Embraer 190 and 195 regional jets, but added its
first A220 – leased from AerCap – in December.

Speaking in London at the World Aviation Festival in early December,
Neeleman struck a positive tone – even with the impact of the Delta
variant on demand in late summer.

”Our business started late for the summer because the whole
certification process took a little longer than we hoped because of
Covid. Then we started selling, which was two weeks’ notice. So the
summer was pretty good for our first summer ever, but we launched a lot
of cities – 16 cities, 39 routes and 13 airplanes. But our RASM and
revenue was higher in October than July, so we are doing well,” he said.

”One of the things I learnt at Azul is that it’s sure much better to be
the only flight on a route, and that’s what we are on 98% of our routes.
You can stimulate new traffic and build new travel patterns,” he says.

A month earlier another US start-up, Avelo Airlines, had launched
operations. The ultra-low-cost carrier, founded by former Allegiant Air
and United Airlines executive Andrew Levy, is based at Los Angeles-area
­Burbank Hollywood airport. Cirium fleets data shows it now has six
Boeing 737-800s in service.

Other North American carriers are lined up for 2022. These include
AirBahn, which aims to launch flights from Los Angeles suburb Irvine,
and which at the end of November disclosed details of its first A320.

Northern Pacific Airways, headquartered in Anchorage, Alaska, plans to
introduce transpacific flights modelled after Icelandair’s transatlantic
operations: low-cost fares with the option of stopovers. Northern
Pacific has acquired its first 757 for the missions, and is looking to
launch in the third quarter of 2022.

Over the border, Canadian start-ups Lynx Air and Jetlines are both
targeting launches in the first half of 2022. Lynx Air is a rebranding
of Calgary-based charter operator Enerjet, which aims to begin
ultra-low-cost services, initially using three Boeing 737 Max jets.

Meanwhile Jetlines, which has promised to launch a low-cost airline for
years, has set its sights on beginning flights by the second quarter of
2022. The Vancouver-based company, which has gone through numerous top
management changes since coming on to the scene in 2015, in late
December took delivery of its first aircraft, a used Airbus A320.

Canadian carrier Sky Regional Airlines though became another North
American regional carrier casualty during the crisis, as it ceased
operations in March 2021. That followed Air Canada’s move to
consolidtate its Air ­Canada Express flights under one ­operator,
transferring 25 Embraer 175s from Sky Regional to Jazz Aviation.

In Latin America, Mexican carrier Volaris in September launched an El
Salvador operation. However, two new airline start-ups planned in
Ecuador have been pushed into 2022.

Equair, which was aiming to launch flights on 22 December, had its
launch pushed back to 10 January, while a move to restart Ecuatoriana –
almost a decade after the collapse of the carrier – is now planned for
2022.

In the Dominican Republic, AraJet, formerly Flycana, plans to introduce
operations in early 2022 as well.

Across regions plans for start-up carriers outpaced the airlines leaving
the market.

CUTBACKS HIT

In Europe, Air Antwerp and Great Dane Airlines were among carriers
forced to call time on operations during 2021. But opportunities in
Norway, resulting from cutbacks at restructuring Norwegian, has prompted
two new entrant projects in the country.

First to reach market was Flyr, which launched operations in June,
initially on domestic routes. It has since begun short-haul flights
within Europe. Cirium fleets data shows it operates five Boeing
737-800s, while it has also agreed to lease 737 Max 8s from Air Lease in
2022.

Low-cost long-haul start-up Norse Atlantic Airways took delivery of its
first aircraft in December, as it prepares to launch transatlantic
flights in spring 2022. It aims to fill a gap left by Norwegian after it
ceased its long-haul operation across the Atlantic. Norse Atlantic plans
to operate a fleet of a dozen 787-9s and three 787-8s by summer 2022.

Elsewhere in Europe, Italian start-up Ego Airways launched operations in
April using a leased Embraer 190. However, there is uncertainty over
another Italian carrier, Blue Panorama Airlines, after it suspended
operations and filed for bankruptcy protection in late October.

In Asia-Pacific, new start-ups include Korean pair Aero K and Air
Premia. Low-cost carrier Aero K launched scheduled domestic flights in
April 2021, becoming the country’s eighth low-cost carrier. Air Premia
secured its AOC in July ahead of launching operations using Boeing 787
Dreamliners in August.

Super Air Jet, a new Indonesian carrier with links to Lion Group founder
Rusdi Kirana, launched flights in the summer. The carrier began flying
from Jakarta to Medan and Batam in August, operating a daily service
with Airbus A320s.

Hong Kong start-up Greater Bay Airlines secured its AOC in October, but
is still to firm a launch date. The airline is headed by Algernon Yau –
­formerly head of Cathay Dragon, the leisure unit shuttered by the Hong
Kong carrier when the pandemic hit – and is backed by Donghai Airlines
owner Bill Wong Cho-bau.

An ambitious Indian start-up also progressed moves to enter the market
when Akasa Air signed an order for 72 Boeing 737 Max aircraft at
November’s Dubai air show. Akasa, which is led by Vinay Dube (see page
20), is a brand of SNV Aviation and has been targeting a launch in
summer 2022. The ­airline in December debuted its branding.

Also on the horizon for 2022 is a new Australian low-cost carrier named
Bonza, which aims to begin services with Boeing 737 Max aircraft. Bonza
is backed by Miami private equity firm 777 Partners. Pending regulatory
approval, Bonza expects to launch in early 2022.

Japanese start-up, Toki Air, emerged in November when ATR during the
Dubai air show disclosed it had signed a letter of intent for two of its
in-development ATR 42-600 short take-off and landing (STOL) versions.
That aircraft is not due for first flight until 2023, but Toki is to
lease two ATR 72-600s to enable it to launch services in 2022.

One airline name in the region that disappeared during 2021 was
Singapore Airline’s brand Silk Air. The latter’s operations were folded
into the SIA in January, including the Boeing 737 Max originally
destined for Silk Air.

Nigerian operator Green Africa Airways launched flights in August using
ATR-72 turbopops, while in December Zambia Airways began domestic
flights linking the capital Lusaka to the city of Ndola. The latter
carrier has been set up in partnership with Ethiopian Airlines, which
has a 45% share in the venture.

However, Air Namibia was an African operator which ceased flights during
2021. The carrier, which suspended flights in February, was formally
liquidated in late March.

In the Middle East, central European budget carrier Wizz Air at the
start of 2021 launched its Abu Dhabi joint venture carrier. Cirium
schedules data shows it operating to 17 destinations from Abu Dhabi. It
comes after the 2020 launch of Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, a joint venture
from Etihad and Air Arabia (see page 18).

The latter is also working on a further joint venture carrier in
Armenia. In September the partners identified the carrier would be
called Fly Arna, though launch details are still be confirmed. ■

Angel Tax: Killing The Goose That Can Lay Golden Eggs

Business World

January 31, 2018

Length: 925 words

Body

Angel Tax is about start-ups that do not raise millions of dollars every
year and grab headlines in pink newspapers. It is about start ups about
whom the Prime Minister and the entire country is passionate about and
is ready to figuratively bet their last rupee as the great deliverer of
India's impending unemployment problem. However, from the numerous
complaints I have personally received about the way Angel Tax is
assessed and charged, it seems that the Central Board of Direct Taxes is
reading out a different script on start ups - one which is daimetrically
opposite to the rest of the country.

Coming to facts. Here are some of letters of complaint that I have
received. Netgear, recently raised INR 1.8Cr from angels and were asked
to pay INR 57.2 lakhs as taxes because the authorities claimed the
entire investment was premium over fair market value (FMV) of INR 1.
Bite Club was asked to pay taxes of INR 60 lakhs on an investment of INR
1.5 Cr as the authorities concluded the fund raise was a premium over
FMV of INR 0 ! KarmYog Education Network received IT Notice of INR 2.5Cr
despite providing all the clarifications, valuation reports and is
absolutely in no position to pay. True Elements received IT Notice of
INR 40 lakhs was compelled to pay INR 8 lakhs.; Posists received IT
notice of INR 12 lakhs and was forced to pay INR 2.4 lakhs.

In the last couple of years, start up investments have been more due to
exits of large venture funds and entry of other large ones from
well-known start ups, or in the form of strategic investments in mature
start ups. Angel funding which waters the roots of the start up
ecosystem seems to be gradully drying up or moving overseas.

The root of the problem lies in the Finance Act 2012 that introduced new
provisions for Income tax on premum paid for subscriptions to shares of
a company, to the extent such shares' premium is in excess of the FMV.
Share premium paid by investors for subscribing to shares in a private
company is taxable in the hands of the company at 30% (exclusive of
surcharge and cess) if and to the extent it is more than the FMV.

The bone of contention is calculating the FMV of a tech start-up; and
more specifically the methodology for doing so. Valuation is based on
valuation certificate by a valuer recognized by the government. Valuers
in India look at traditional methods of valuation which apply to mature
companies with regular cash flows.

Most technology start ups raise money before monetization and there is
no underlying actual cash flow analysis available for traditional
valuation methods. Most startups are almost always asset light and do
not have assets in their books to justify their intrinsic value.

Tax authorities refuse to accept Discounted Free Cash Flow (DCF) Method
for calculating valuation of start-ups, even as that is most common
process of valuation and is recognised under Rule UA(2) as one of the 2
methods of valuation for unquoted equity shares. They claim this is done
at the behest of the management. In many cases, when start-ups are
unable to achieve the projections as per DCF valuation, the authorities
argue the valuation must be revised on a backdated basis.

Conventional valuation methods fail to take into acount the
uncertainities surrounding a start-up. Valuators can at best validate
the basic assumptions, market potential and other macro-factors, but it
is not possible for a anyone to have perfect foresight of what will
happen in the future. There are too many risk factors that can lead to
failure to achieve projections and more than 90% of the startups
statistically fail to do so.

Ironically, the actual provisions recognised this problem and thus has
exception clauses for start-ups to promote entrepreneurship. However,
the eligible criterion for start-up has numerous criteria like maximum
turnover of INR 25 Crores, maximum 5 years of existence, nature of
business. A critical criterion is certification of elligible start-ups
by the Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification.

While the intent behind the new provisions to curb generation and use of
unaccounted money is well accepted, the exceptions granted cover only a
limited range of circumstances and genuine commercial business decisions
also get affected. The fact that since 2016 only 74 start-ups have been
certified 'eligible' by the Inter-Ministerial board highlights the
ineffectivness of the exception provisions.

The authorities deem all start-ups 'guilty till proven innocent'; as
even the appeal process requires them to deposit 20% of total tax
claimed and file for appeal within 30 days of receiving a notice! For
many cash strapped start-ups, complying to such draconian regulations is
virtually impossible.

Both founders and investors are extremely wary of this provision and
many companies are actively seeking to relocate to more start up
friendly jurisdictions overseas.

The digital industry is not averse to paying direct taxes, but such
taxation should be on actual profits and not notional ones. Given the
high rate of failure of start-ups, this is a critical aspect of taxing
the fast evolving tech sector; or we run the risk of killing the goose
even before it lays a golden egg!

Virgin Orbit clarifies the cause behind its 'Start Me Up' mission's
failure to reach orbit

January 25 -- Everything was going great until it wasn't in the skies
over Cornwall, UK on Monday. Virgin Orbit, the space launch division of
Sir Richard Branson's sprawling commercial empire, was in the midst of
setting a major milestone for the country and the nation: to be the
first orbital launch from European soil. The carrier aircraft, Cosmic
Girl, had successfully taken off from Spaceport Cornwall, LauncherOne
had cleanly separated from the modified 747 and properly ignited its
first stage rocket, blasting it and its payload of satellites into
space. But before they could be pushed into their proper orbit by the
rocket's second stage, something went wrong. On Thursday, Virgin Orbit
leaders provided a preliminary explanation as to just what happened.

"At an altitude of approximately 180 km, the upper stage experienced an
anomaly. This anomaly prematurely ended the first burn of the upper
stage," the company told Engadget via email. "This event ended the
mission, with the rocket components and payload falling back to Earth
within the approved safety corridor without ever achieving orbit."

Virgin Orbit has also announced a "formal" investigation into the root
causes of the anomaly which will be led by Jim Sponnick, who developed
the Atlas and Delta launch systems, and Chad Foerster, Virgin Orbit's
Chief Engineer. Despite the setback, the company is already in contact
with UK officials to reschedule the launch for as soon as late 2023.

Pakistan's PTV show discusses promotion of IT business, Kashmir issue

BBC Monitoring South Asia - Political

Length: 1024 words

The following is a summary of the talk show "Riyasat" [the state],
hosted by anchor Ahmed Quraishi on state-owned PTV News in Urdu at 15:00
gmt on 4 January. The programme provides analysis and views of experts
and politicians on important news of the day.

Potential for IT business

Anchor Ahmed Quraishi opened the show, saying that a very big story from
Pakistan that is being discussed all over the world in a positive light
is about Pakistan's IT exports, IT potential and Pakistani start-up
companies. He mentioned that Bloomberg mentioned that Pakistan's IT
export crossed 300m dollars in 12 months only. He mentioned that Prime
Minister Imran Khan has specially focused on the IT development in
Pakistan. He introduced Nabeel Qadeer, an IT professional who initiated
start up culture in Pakistan and has been advising the government of
Pakistan on IT for the past several years. Quraishi mentioned that
Qadeer was the founder and director of Pakistan's first incubator.

Qadeer said that he has been working with governments for the past 10 or
12 years and was currently working with the Kamyab Jawan [successful
youth] programme, which is a youth loan programme of the government. He
appreciated the role of Usman Dar, Special Assistant to Prime Minister
on Youth Affairs and head of Kamyab Jawan programme, in making the
programme a success. Qadeer said the programme links the common people
with the money needed for start-ups.

Qadeer mentioned that "Pakistani start-ups have raised 350m dollars in
investment during 2021, which is an amount higher than the investment
raised during the last eight years combined". He said the investor
community has played an important role in building good start-up funds
or venture capital funds in Pakistan and Pakistani venture capital funds
have collaborated with the international funds. He mentioned that
funding has been coming from East Asia for example Singapore, the Middle
East and also the United States.

Appreciating the role of the government in promotion of IT, Qadeer said
"Prime Minister Imran Khan is the super hero created by Pakistan in the
past 40 or 50 years" and "he is a brand in himself". He also mentioned
the foreign policy of Pakistan that has been built not only by the
government but the [military] establishment. He added that the armed
forces have been very good during the past years and relationship with
countries like Malaysia and Turkey have been strengthened, so the
investors see that there is stability in Pakistan and long-term returns
can be expected. He urged the government to make sure that "the cost of
failure of a start-up is minimised".

Qadeer mentioned that "seven to eight million youth would be above 18
years of age in 2023 and would become voters" and these are the people
who have the highest interest in start-ups therefore, government's focus
on IT business would help it increase its voters as well. He remarked
that "universities in Pakistan are failing miserably" and advised that
the focus should be on skill development.

Anniversary of UN resolution on Kashmir

Quraishi referred to recently published Associated Press report on the
closure of mosques in Indian-administered Kashmir headlined "In Kashmir,
closed mosque raises questions about India's religious freedom".
Quraishi mentioned that India has closed mosques in Kashmir on the
pretext of Covid-19 or security issues. He said it is a major
development that the western media has raised questions on the Indian
policy in Kashmir.

Quraishi said 5 January 2022 is the 73rd anniversary of the UN
resolution 91, passed in 1949 that "presented the plebiscite as an
option for peaceful solution of the Kashmir issue" and reported that the
Pakistan-administered Kashmir government and the government of Pakistan
would be observing this day tomorrow by organising important events. He
contacted Dr Irfan Ashraf, Director General of Cultural Academy on the
government of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and asked him about the
events organised by the government.

Ashraf said on 5 January, the representatives of the government of
Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the opposition and the people from other
walks of life would gather in Muzaffarabad and in a large procession
would march to the UN office in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to
"present a memorandum to remind the UN that Kashmiris were still waiting
for the plebiscite that had been promised". He claimed that in the
Indian-administered Kashmir, the Indian forces were killing Kashmiri
youth in fake encounters and incidents of "extrajudicial killings" and
"enforced disappearances" have been taking place in a large number.

Ashraf said "the case of Kashmiris is internationally recognised and the
UN has passed several resolutions on it and Kashmiris hope that the
international community would fulfil its promise". He remarked, "We want
to continue the struggle of Kashmir in a peaceful and non-violent
manner." He said "we appeal to the international community, particularly
the human rights organisations, like the Amnesty International and
others, on this anniversary that they should send missions to Kashmir
and the UN should send a fact finding mission to look into the human
right violations" as "the situation in Kashmir is heading towards a
humanitarian crisis".

Quraishi claimed the cultural policy of the Pakistan-administered
Kashmir government was important because "the Indian government has been
following a policy to erase the Kashmiri culture, so that it could fully
merge Kashmir into India". Ashraf remarked that Kashmir has a very rich
culture and claimed that identity and India wants to make the Indian
culture dominant there. He mentioned that the Cultural Academy has
written to the cultural wings of all the foreign embassies in Islamabad
saying that "we want to launch cultural exchange programme to promote
Kashmiri culture around the world". He said the cultural dress of
Kashmir would be introduced. He also said that the Academy would create
films and dramas "to present the liberation movement of Kashmir in the
right perspective and highlight the sacrifices of Kashmiris".

hosted by anchor Ahmed Quraishi on state-owned PTV News in Urdu at 15:00
gmt on 4 January. The programme provides analysis and views of experts
and politicians on important news of the day.

Potential for IT business

Anchor Ahmed Quraishi opened the show, saying that a very big story from
Pakistan that is being discussed all over the world in a positive light
is about Pakistan's IT exports, IT potential and Pakistani start-up
companies. He mentioned that Bloomberg mentioned that Pakistan's IT
export crossed 300m dollars in 12 months only. He mentioned that Prime
Minister Imran Khan has specially focused on the IT development in
Pakistan. He introduced Nabeel Qadeer, an IT professional who initiated
start up culture in Pakistan and has been advising the government of
Pakistan on IT for the past several years. Quraishi mentioned that
Qadeer was the founder and director of Pakistan's first incubator.

Qadeer said that he has been working with governments for the past 10 or
12 years and was currently working with the Kamyab Jawan [successful
youth] programme, which is a youth loan programme of the government. He
appreciated the role of Usman Dar, Special Assistant to Prime Minister
on Youth Affairs and head of Kamyab Jawan programme, in making the
programme a success. Qadeer said the programme links the common people
with the money needed for start-ups.

Qadeer mentioned that "Pakistani start-ups have raised 350m dollars in
investment during 2021, which is an amount higher than the investment
raised during the last eight years combined". He said the investor
community has played an important role in building good start-up funds
or venture capital funds in Pakistan and Pakistani venture capital funds
have collaborated with the international funds. He mentioned that
funding has been coming from East Asia for example Singapore, the Middle
East and also the United States.

Appreciating the role of the government in promotion of IT, Qadeer said
"Prime Minister Imran Khan is the super hero created by Pakistan in the
past 40 or 50 years" and "he is a brand in himself". He also mentioned
the foreign policy of Pakistan that has been built not only by the
government but the [military] establishment. He added that the armed
forces have been very good during the past years and relationship with
countries like Malaysia and Turkey have been strengthened, so the
investors see that there is stability in Pakistan and long-term returns
can be expected. He urged the government to make sure that "the cost of
failure of a start-up is minimised".

Qadeer mentioned that "seven to eight million youth would be above 18
years of age in 2023 and would become voters" and these are the people
who have the highest interest in start-ups therefore, government's focus
on IT business would help it increase its voters as well. He remarked
that "universities in Pakistan are failing miserably" and advised that
the focus should be on skill development.

Anniversary of UN resolution on Kashmir

Quraishi referred to recently published Associated Press report on the
closure of mosques in Indian-administered Kashmir headlined "In Kashmir,
closed mosque raises questions about India's religious freedom".
Quraishi mentioned that India has closed mosques in Kashmir on the
pretext of Covid-19 or security issues. He said it is a major
development that the western media has raised questions on the Indian
policy in Kashmir.

Quraishi said 5 January 2022 is the 73rd anniversary of the UN
resolution 91, passed in 1949 that "presented the plebiscite as an
option for peaceful solution of the Kashmir issue" and reported that the
Pakistan-administered Kashmir government and the government of Pakistan
would be observing this day tomorrow by organising important events. He
contacted Dr Irfan Ashraf, Director General of Cultural Academy on the
government of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and asked him about the
events organised by the government.

Ashraf said on 5 January, the representatives of the government of
Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the opposition and the people from other
walks of life would gather in Muzaffarabad and in a large procession
would march to the UN office in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to
"present a memorandum to remind the UN that Kashmiris were still waiting
for the plebiscite that had been promised". He claimed that in the
Indian-administered Kashmir, the Indian forces were killing Kashmiri
youth in fake encounters and incidents of "extrajudicial killings" and
"enforced disappearances" have been taking place in a large number.

Ashraf said "the case of Kashmiris is internationally recognised and the
UN has passed several resolutions on it and Kashmiris hope that the
international community would fulfil its promise". He remarked, "We want
to continue the struggle of Kashmir in a peaceful and non-violent
manner." He said "we appeal to the international community, particularly
the human rights organisations, like the Amnesty International and
others, on this anniversary that they should send missions to Kashmir
and the UN should send a fact finding mission to look into the human
right violations" as "the situation in Kashmir is heading towards a
humanitarian crisis".

Quraishi claimed the cultural policy of the Pakistan-administered
Kashmir government was important because "the Indian government has been
following a policy to erase the Kashmiri culture, so that it could fully
merge Kashmir into India". Ashraf remarked that Kashmir has a very rich
culture and claimed that identity and India wants to make the Indian
culture dominant there. He mentioned that the Cultural Academy has
written to the cultural wings of all the foreign embassies in Islamabad
saying that "we want to launch cultural exchange programme to promote
Kashmiri culture around the world". He said the cultural dress of
Kashmir would be introduced. He also said that the Academy would create
films and dramas "to present the liberation movement of Kashmir in the
right perspective and highlight the sacrifices of Kashmiris".

With pandemic ravaging, 13 start-ups go belly-up in the deadpool

Inability to raise the next round of funding at the opportune moment,
lack of agility, need of talent and leadership conflicts played their
part. On the one hand, the country has been adding unicorns quickly,
while on the other, it has dead-pooled many. As the pandemic ravaged, 13
start-ups founded in 2020 went belly-up between March 2020 and May 2021.

According to research firm Tracxn, the firms starting with SOLOSOS to
Designing Mafia and SGB Global Tech were from across the country, while
Uttar Pradesh topped the charts with five companies, followed by Tamil
Nadu with two firms.

"The failure of some start-ups is not primarily on account of their
business models not being viable, but instead is a combination of other
factors also, amongst them the most crucial being their inability to
raise the next round of funding at the opportune moment. Starts-ups
generally tend to scale their businesses at a rapid pace, looking to
achieve a leadership position, in their respective domains sooner than
later," banker and investor Rajiv Dadlani told BusinessLine.

"As they rapidly accelerate growth, they tend to burn more cash, hence
are dependent on constant fund-raising - such as Series A, B, C and D
rounds," Dadlani, who had invested in more than 50 companies, said.

The companies winding-up operations during these 14 months were much
lower compared with fiscal 2020 (April 1, 2019-March 31, 2020), when 284
companies were dead-pooled in India. Of these, 278 startups were founded
from 2010 onwards.

"One of the most important reasons is the start-ups' lack of agility to
transform in these Covid-19 times and rise to the expectations of the
customers, with the absence of adequate talent and competency for
execution as they never paid top dollars. Further, there were also
leadership conflicts that led to many a failure, despite the fact those
companies were successful in raising funds," said Dhianu Das,
co-founder, Agility Venture Partners, said.

"Also in certain cases, the founders lacked focus and concentration,"
Das, an investor in 40 early-stage start-ups, said.

Fourteen startups, including Moglix, Urban Company, ChargeBee and
Gupshup, among others have joined the unicorn club in this calendar
year, the latest being Zeta, a banking tech startup co-founded by
billionaire and serial entrepreneur Bhavin Turakhia.

Know The Marketing Plans That Can Make Your Startup Soar

Business World

India is home to one of the largest numbers of start-ups in the world.
Thousands of start-ups in the country have achieved a tremendous amount
of success in their respective fields. Some have brought disruptive
changes to their sector while a few have carved an entirely new market
niche for themselves. More than 100 start-ups in the country have turned
into unicorns and have been successfully transforming the lives of
millions of people. However, not all start-ups have met with success.
Several start-ups, despite promising beginning and receiving funding,
have failed. Some have even been forced to shut their shops. While there
have been various reasons for the failure of the start-ups, not having a
proper marketing game plan tops the list. In the subsequent paragraphs,
we will discuss how start-ups can create an effective marketing strategy
that can help them establish a long-term sustainable presence in the
market.

Define your target market

Before starting the marketing efforts, the company first needs to
understand who is the target audience. Defining the market could be
based on age, sex, location, or any other parameter. This helps the
company to effectively utilise its resources and maximise the return on
investment. In today's world, where digital marketing is dominating the
marketing landscape, it is possible to target customers based on
pre-specified characteristics. Defining the market helps the company
assume a focused marketing approach and avoid wastage of efforts.

Define your value preposition

Making the customers aware of what makes your company or its product or
services unique is one of the most effective means of establishing brand
identity and improving sales. However, the company first needs to
internally sort this matter and should be convinced about its own value
preposition or USP before communicating it to the outside world.

Analyse the market

Market analysis is the key to staying ahead of the competition. Knowing
the latest market trends and understanding the strategies adopted by the
competitors can also help the companies readjust their marketing plans.
Staying informed about the market could be the real difference between
the success and failure of any marketing plan.

Set up a budget and the performance indexes

Like any other endeavor, marketing also requires capital. Organisations
must keep track of the amount they are spending on marketing initiatives
and measure the return on investment on each marketing activity. This
helps them understand which activity to focus more on and which
activities to go slow with. Defining the budget also helps organisations
avoid overspending on marketing activities. It has been observed that
many organisations overspent on their marketing efforts and later did
not have enough budgets to focus on their core competencies.

Set realistic, achievable, and measurable goals

While every organisation wants to set up high goals for itself, it is
also important to set goals that are realistic and achievable depending
on the resources available at hand. Setting unrealistic goals

negatively impacts the morale of the team. The targets should be
measurable so that the leadership knows where they stand in terms of
achieving the targets after a certain period of time.

Make an extensive digital marketing plan

In a world where a majority of people are connected through the internet
and using smartphones, having a thorough digital marketing plan can help
organisations reach the right customers. Email marketing, Social Media
Marketing (SMM), Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), Content Marketing and
Pay Per Click (PPC) can help companies reach the right audience fast,
effectively, and affordably. Every organisation is different and has
different digital marketing needs. Therefore, understanding what is
right for your organisation can save a lot of effort and investment.

Good old-fashioned PR still holds good

The value of PR in marketing cannot be discounted. PR can help an
organisation establish a personal touch with potential customers and
leave a long-lasting impression. Even today in the world of digital
marketing, PR is one of the most effective means of establishing a brand
identity.

Understand that marketing is not just about asking people to buy

Marketing is much more than merely asking people to buy products from
you. An effective marketing strategy has a mix of efforts that sell and
provide value to the customers. This value can be in form of interesting
videos, relevant information, trending updates, tips & tricks, etc.
Anything that can help a customer to recall your brand name is an
effective marketing practice.

Indian scientists develop mercury-free lamp for water purifiers

India Water Review

New Delhi: A group of Indian scientists has developed a mercury-free
ultraviolet lamp that can be used in water purifiers. While use of
ultraviolet lamps in water purifiers is common, the presence of mercury
in these lamps has been considered potentially hazardous.

Scientists from two CSIR labs - Central Electronics Engineering Research
Institute (CEERI) at Pilani and Nagpur-based National Environmental
Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) joined hands with Jaipur-based
Birla Institute of Scientific Research to develop the lamp.

They have managed to engineer an optimized dielectric discharge based
mercury-free Vacuum UV/UV light source for water sterilization. The lamp
can produce desired level of wavelengths for deactivation of bacteria
within 10 seconds without the use of mercury.

In addition to being mercury-free, the lamp has a filament-less light
source and there are no end sleeves. Since it uses dielectric-barrier
discharge or DBD source, start-up time is negligible. It has broader
wavelength coverage due to dimmer radiations and medium pressure.

Naturally available water may contain pathogenic organisms and toxic
compounds. UV radiation is preferable for water purification over
chemical treatment. UV radiation is widely used for water sterilization
as it does not create any byproduct during treatment and does not alter
the taste of water. It also does not eliminate minerals.

But it has several disadvantages which include start-up time, filament
failure, sleeve breakage, dimensional restrictions and non-reparability.
Mercury containing UV-lamps generate a considerable amount of toxic
mercury waste at the end of their life as a typical UV lamp contains 20
to200 mg of mercury.

"We have engineered an optimized dielectric discharge based mercury-free
VUV/UV light source with a novel structural design that produces strong
spectral bands peaking at wavelengths 253 nanometer and 172 nanometer
along with a weak band peaking at wavelength 265 nanometer, that has
been tested on a few representative bacteria to show its usefulness for
efficient water sterilization", CEERI's Dr Ram Prakash was quoted as
saying to India Science Wire.

The unique structural design of the lamp enables it to produce desired
UV wavelengths. The lamp has been tested for five types of bacteria - E
coli, Shigella boydii, Vibrio, coliforms and fecal coliform.

Within 10 seconds, all bacteria got deactivated.

"The lamp been tested further for water with turbidity level and its
on-time efficiency has been found to be 200 per cent as compared to
standard equivalent mercury based UV-lamp", said Dr Prakash.

Jeevan Gnanam, CEO, Orion City : Interview

Oxford Business Group: Articles

Jeevan Gnanam : Interview

What steps can be taken to create a better environment for innovative
and digital start-ups beyond the provision of funding?

JEEVAN GNANAM: The government needs to look at regulatory changes that
affect the cost of failure for a start-up and its investors. Simply put,
it should be easy for a start-up to commence and shut down operations,
and investors should not have to take on more liability as investing in
a start-up is already considered risky.

For start-ups this means that the costs of starting and closing a
business should be a lot less; the costs are higher here than in most
countries in the region. For investors this means making it less
expensive to bring in capital and allowing capital to flow freely. For
example, we haven't yet established limited liability partnership
structures for venture capitalists to set up in Sri Lanka. For fresh
capital to come in, they have to circumvent complicated exchange
control. On top of all of this, there is inconsistent regulation on
capital gains in cases where the investment is successful.

Another way to nurture start-ups locally is to help with access to
nearby markets, such as India, Bangladesh and Myanmar. One way to do
this is to support them with structures like incubators and accelerators
to help start-ups expand regionally.

How would you evaluate Sri Lanka's ICT infrastructure and technological
skill set?

GNANAM: There are a number of gaps in the start-up segment and the
broader ICT industry. The most important aspects for start-ups include
the ability to accept and send payments online easily, artificial
intelligence (AI), having access to proper accelerators and incubators
where they can learn skill sets like growth hacking, and being able to
enter local and international markets.

For the ICT industry as a whole there are some gaps in smartphone and
internet penetration. For example, smartphone penetration is currently
at 35%, according to data calculated using International Mobile
Equipment Identity numbers. However, the actual number of people using
smartphones at their full capability is far lower. Basic ICT
infrastructure needs to be more accessible so that Sri Lankans can
connect to the global economy.

The biggest concern for me, however, is the skills required for
tomorrow's jobs, which are going to be based around the latest
technologies, such as AI, deep learning and the internet of things. I
think Sri Lanka as a nation has to make a concentrated effort to prepare
for the coming years. The Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service
Companies, along with the government, has set out programmes in the near
future to do just that.

To what extent can collaboration between the private and public sectors
contribute to the growth of Sri Lanka's digital ecosystem?

GNANAM: I believe the two sectors have to work together to grow the Sri
Lankan digital ecosystem. The public sector can enable early market
access for start-up companies to address the fundamental economic and
social needs of the country. What is most important is the active
stewardship of the public sector.

Having said that, public-private partnerships should be balanced, and
sometimes over-regulation by the public sector can be an issue.
Innovation within the financial technology segment, which has grown at a
very slow pace due to regulatory requirements, is one example. In this
case, deregulation and suggested policy, such as the creation of a
sandbox environment, will help grow budding start-ups, which will in
turn contribute actively to the GDP of the country.

We would also suggest special approval for government agencies to use
start-ups for product manufacturing. Typically, the request for proposal
process takes six to nine months, even for software that can be built
within three to six months. There are quite a few solutions that would
improve the efficiency of the government and the social lives of
citizens, but which have not been implemented due to bureaucratic
hurdles.

Body

While equity vesting agreements can have deleterious effects, the
benefits far outweigh the costs, thus making it a staple constituent of
many agreements.

While the concept of equity vesting has been in practice for long, it
has gained much prominence with the maturing of the startup ecosystem in
the country. While vesting acts as an especially important mechanism for
ensuring a startup's long-term success, it is often misunderstood and/or
implemented incorrectly.

Let us understand briefly about vesting, its importance, and ways to
implement it.

What is Equity Vesting?

Vesting is the process of accruing a full right that cannot be taken
away by a third party. In the context of the founders' equity, a startup
initially grants a package of stock to each founder.

Equity vesting can be captured through the following example - When a
start-up is incorporated with four founders with an equal shareholding
of 25% each but, say, after 12 months one of the founders decides to
quit, then under an equity vesting agreement, he will not be allowed to
claim the entire 25% of the stock as he is leaving the journey in the
initial stage and wouldn't be contributing to the growth of the startup.

While, as founder/co-founder, they are the owner for the shareholding
portion decided for themselves, the company still retains the right to
forfeit or buy back the unvested equity, if any of them walk away
without contributing the effort spread across a vesting schedule. Once
the person has completed his tenure as per the vesting schedule, he
rightfully gets the right to all of the shares and the company does not
retain any right to buyback or forfeit in case one decides to move.

Why is Equity Vesting done?

Equity vesting is done to ensure that cofounders/critical talent stays
for an extensive duration of time, typically required to stabilize the
company, thus resulting in potential long-term success. Its benefit
could broadly be summarized as below:

# Facilitates long-term commitment from founders:

The startup journey is full of ups and downs and some of the founders
might lose faith in the shared vision during this journey. It is a known
fact that many founders leave companies in their formative years. The
startups have limited capital and remarkably high reliance on the
founders' efforts to work and stabilise the company and by vesting of
equity ownership over several years, a startup can motivate founders to
stay and continue their efforts to grow the business.

# Minimizing damages from existing founders:

Without vesting, if one of the founders exits after a short period of
time, a new company can jeopardize its future success.

Imagine one started a company with three other people, with each
receiving 25% of the equity. One founder decides to leave the company
after a few months. Without vesting, he still owns 25% of the company,
25% voting right with regards to management decisions, and might retain
influence over how the company is run. He might also demand 25% of the
proceeds when the company is sold a few years later.

STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVE

# Investors Protection:

It is a market practice for professional investors - venture capital
firms or angel investors to demand stock vesting provision from founders
and key employees before committing to their investment. It is a way to
gauge the commitment of people involved in the company, and also to
protect equity from departing partners.

It is typically done in the early/earliest stage of the start-up's
founding as the start-up seeks to align the incentives of all the
founders/critical talent with that of the start-up. Typically, equity
vesting is done for 4 years using 1-year cliffs i.e., if one had 50%
equity and he/she leaves in 2Y the company forfeits 25% of equity.
Obviously, the greater the duration of stay, the more the equity will
vest and, in this case, if one stays for complete tenure the entire
equity vests, thus rewarding the concerned for staying for a long
duration with the company.

Investors:

From the perspective of the investors. their interests are protected as
the founders/co-founders and other talents who are critical to the
company's growth have the financial incentive to not leave the company
at an early stage.

From a start-up perspective, once investors know that all the key
individuals are subject to a vesting agreement, they have sufficient
peace of mind as they know that these critical resources cannot just
walk away from the firm at no financial cost.

Founders:

In the Indian context, co-founders' rift, as well as the attrition of
critical masses ara some of the key reasons for the failure of startups.
The vesting arrangement ensures alignment of interest over a period,
thus helping in increasing loyalty as well as ensuring damage control in
case of unlikely rift and departure. Also, it makes sense in cases where
there is a separation of ownership and management, from the viewpoint of
a start-up, a vesting agreement will allay the concerns of the founders
that the CEO/CTO or other key professionals cannot walk away from the
firm without having a detrimental impact on his financial fortunes. This
will augment their confidence levels.

Advisors:

In India, advisors are given shares based on the vesting agreement.
Advisors typically subsume advisors, mentors, and consultants. By
subjecting them to a vesting agreement, they are accorded an incentive
to participate in the firm's success over the long run. Thus, from a
start-up viewpoint, advisors who have been subject to equity vesting
agreements have their incentives aligned with the long-run interests of
the firm, thereby augmenting stakeholder confidence.

While equity vesting agreements can have deleterious effects (making a
CEO continue when he/she does not want to do so) the benefits far
outweigh the costs, thus making it a staple constituent of many
agreements. Also, in case of any M&A or sale of the company, vesting
agreements can include a clause for accelerated vesting which can
protect the interest of founders and key employees.

Startup Saturday: Failure in the house: lessons from the falls

Hindustan Times

February 1, 2020 Saturday

Length: 914 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, Feb. 1 -- Pune even saw an event called the F*** Up Night, where
founders of companies spoke about failures and learnings from them. This
week three startup founders share their failure stories.

Lesson learnt: Know every little detail about for your business

Prathamesh Korgaonkar, founder Focus Medium Solutions and Kicktech Box
Inc

In 2013, Korgaonkar, an IT engineer working at Cognizant, developed a
new product - a multifactor authentication tool that could be ubiquitous
in the financial industry, given the need for security.

"I was working at Cognizant when I started working on this multifactor
authentication tool - a Smart Watch. All went well with the hardware. It
worked at the PoC level and so I filed for a patent in India in 2013 and
later for a patent in the US. Unfortunately, this turned out to be my
biggest mistake.

The big mistake

"I knew patents in India take about five years, so I filed for a patent
in the US after filing for the Indian one because there a patent takes
three years. After filing for patent I thought, why not start looking
for funds in the meantime?

"I met a lot of investors, but unfortunately investors are very passive
about hardware and products so it was quite difficult. Khosla Ventures
evinced an interest but wanted to buy out my IP.

"VCs in the US are more willing to invest in a startup so I decided to
do my MS at California and simultaneously search for funds to set up my
Smart Watch company.

"Then it was just bad luck. I had to come to India for my sister's
marriage after completing a first semester at a California university.
They debarred me from entering the US from San Francisco airport by
saying I am not intellectually and financially fit to continue my
education in US. They also banned me for five years."

"In 2016, I received my US patent, but the India patent is still
pending. Because the original patent was filed in India I cannot use the
American patent alone. The original patent has to be cleared first."

"It was my biggest mistake to not get into the nitty-gritty of patent
filing, its procedures and time spans. Because of this problem I shut
down the idea completely.

Korgaonkar fought a legal case against his de-barrment from the US and
won.

Today, Korgaonkar is growing his second business venture Focusmedium
Solutions, a digital marketing agency and, a digital marketing service
in Delaware, US, named Kicktechbox, Inc, aimed at ecomm platforms.

Lesson learnt: When to pull the plug on your business

Sandeep Saxena, founder, Hapy India, a startup that produces videos

"In 2005 I started Acton biotech where we offered genetic testing to
determine the best line of treatment for diseases such as cancer and the
chemotherapy. From 2005 to 2014 we were doing extremely well with great
revenues and building partnerships.

The big mistake

"I was forewarned by my investors that the "big guys" are planning to
enter this segment. A small fry like me stood to lose ground. I didn't
listen, or perhaps I didn't want to believe that what I had grown with
my sweat and tears would just roll over.

"And that was my biggest mistake.

"Soon it was impossible for me to compete with the deep pockets that had
entered the business. It was impossible for me to offer the rates they
could. "Impossible for me to reach out to the number of customers they
would. I could not afford a large marketing team. It was not long before
I started making losses.

"I should have paid heed to my investors' advice and either sold off or
got into a JV. I had to shut shop. I sold my equipment to a hospital.

"When your revenues are high, there's cash in the bank and you see large
competitors on the horizon, it's time to say adieu to your baby."

Lessons Learnt: Know everything about the business

Akshit Mehta, founder, Vork coworking spaces

"I comes from a family of realtors. However, the real estate business
didn't excite me and though I worked with my dad for a few years I was
not really into it. Marriage happened and my wife Anjali, who's into
interior designing, suggested I look at the business "of giving out desk
space".

"I had tried a fitness venture, however, finance issues made me quit
that."

"I leaped into the desk-space business. I rented 5,000 sqft in Andheri
and Anjali did the designing. We were open for business on Oct 10, 2016.

"It was three months since we opened and not a single seat was sold.
Then demonetisation happened and we got our first client. In 2017 I
opened another centre at Lower Parel and later, one more at Kala Ghoda.
Those centres, too, went through their ups and downs, doing occupancy at
35%, then 80% and 100%, and then back to 35%"

The big mistake

"I realised that I needed to know more about the business. I attended a
conference on coworking spaces and that really opened up my eyes.

"When I started in Andheri, I had no research done, had no idea about
the business. I did not understand how people calculate distance from
local transport.

"For an entrepreneur like me, I have to keep it niche. I cannot and am
not interested in 5,000-seater work spaces. My target audience is the
shared ecosystem where everyone knows everyone.

"I am bootstrapped. I have invested Rs 2.8 crore and have to be very
careful of how I spend it. While I may break even operationally,
breaking even with my capex is hard."

Why Franchising Model has Become a Huge Success

Franchising World

May 31, 2021

Copyright 2021 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights
Reserved

[]

Length: 539 words

Dateline: New Delhi, 2021-05-31 17:48:09

Body

May 31 -- Franchising has been around for decades. It's a method of
business that takes something that works and repeats it over and over
again. By building businesses that are successful, and then recreating
the best parts, business owners have been able to find growth over and
over again. This is true for all industries and all markets.

It's what makes franchising so great, and becoming a franchisee a
successful model that more and more entrepreneurs have set out to
conquer. It's also why more and more professionals are looking to become
business owners by purchasing a franchise vs. starting from scratch.
Whether you're already a franchisee or are in your beginning stages of
research, take a look at these factors and keep them in mind:

Factors Affecting the Business-

 

 

 

 

Franchised outlets in India have built such a massive consumer base
mainly by focusing on Indianisation or customization of products or
services, thus connecting with the customer segment and catering to
their specific needs. The demographic shift that India is experiencing
with its middle class has led to an increase in its disposable income.
Due to this shift, there has been a consistent growth in the number of
consumers for branded products and franchised names. However, there are
multiple other factors influencing the franchising model to become such
a huge success such as:

1. Lower Rate of Failure-

Franchises have a lower rate of failure as compared to start-ups.
According to a study by IBM and Oxford in 2016, 90% of the Indian
start-ups fail within the first five years, against only 15% of
franchises. Since the business concept has already been worked out with
the existing loopholes been fixed, the model today is efficient, low
risk, and low cost over any start-up. Thus, making it more appealing to
the investor.

2. Increasing Income and Purchasing Power-

Indian disposable income was approximately INR 131 trillion in 2018 and
is expected to double by 2025. The rising income levels in rural and
urban India have resulted in increased spending on discretionary items
as against necessities. This rise in income and spending capacity across
India coupled with increased awareness, has created a substantial demand
for domestic and international brands. A large number of companies are
expanding beyond tier-I cities and increasing their presence by adopting
the franchise model.

3. Privatization in Different Sectors-

With the rapid privatization in India across various sectors such as
education, healthcare, telecommunication, and others, there is a
constant rise in the influx of international brands in the country. With
this increase, the scope for franchising has also gone up. Today,
companies across sectors such as EuroKids, Ferns N Petals, Vakrangee,
Connect India, and DTDC are key examples of successful privatization and
franchising in India.

4. First-time Entrepreneurs-

The newfound entrepreneurial spirit of young Indians has led many
individuals to enter the franchise business. Presently, around 35% of
all franchise owners have been first-timers in business. These
entrepreneurs choose franchising due to the range of benefits it offers
such as reduced risk, association with an established brand, training,
and support, etc.

'Entrepreneurship education is key to a start-up ecosystem'

Hindustan Times Mumbai

May 22, 2019 Wednesday

Copyright 2019 HT Digital streams Ltd All Rights Reserved

Length: 973 words

Dateline: Mumbai

Body

Mumbai, May 22 -- India has always had a rich culture of
entrepreneurship which is evident from the number of family businesses
that operated in pre-Independent India and thrived over a period of four
to five decades till the country gained its freedom.

The creation of enterprises continued, albeit on a slower pace and
confined to only few communities known primarily for their risk-taking
abilities.

These communities, with trading mind-set, believed in short-term profit
generation and never looked at scaling up their businesses.

However, later in the years post-Independence, entrepreneurial
enthusiasm took a dip as government chose to take control of
manufacturing facilities and basic financial services.

The technology boom of late '90s and early 2000 again fuelled the
entrepreneurship boom as government had taken various steps to withdraw
their role from regulating private businesses.

Since technology boom, the entrepreneurship vigour has continuously been
on the uptrend as the millennials and Generation Z build up an
innovation-based economy that promises sustainable growth solution. The
Government of India's initiative of 'Start-up India' and commitment to
improve country's ranking in 'Ease of Doing Business' globally since
last few years have fastened this movement, thereby catapulting the
economy into a higher growth zone.

While, initially the failure rate of start-ups was high due to reasons
such as inadequate funding, inviability of business idea and meagre
opportunities in terms of reach to target markets, the scenario is
changing gradually.

As stakeholders of start-up ecosystem come together to help start-ups
grow and survive the onslaught of early turbulence, India is
increasingly becoming an ideal start-up hub.

Academic institutions play a vital role in shaping up the start-up
ecosystem in any country. The thriving start-up culture in the country
in the last decade has brought a disruption in entrepreneurial
education.

For the last few years, premier management and technical institutions
have started focusing on entrepreneurial aspects, thereby nurturing
their students' dream of enterprise creation.

However, not many institutions focus on providing a fullfledged
entrepreneurship course for students.

Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII) is perhaps the
first institute in India that pioneered the concept of entrepreneurship
education, way back in early 1980s.

So far, 1,486 students have graduated from the institute with a 78
percent success rate either in new enterprise creation or
diversification of family business. Entrepreneurship education creates
the base of a strong start-up ecosystem as it addresses the fundamental
issues before the idea is born.

However, along with education, the ecosystem also requires strong
research creation that focuses on filling the gaps of availability of
trained educators, researchers, business consultants and resource
persons in entrepreneurship at higher learning institutions or
professional organisations, government departments or industry in India.

The cadre of academicians thus created, will raise the standard of
education and research, thereby ensuring wider acceptance of
entrepreneurship as a career option in the society.

Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India has also taken an
initiative in this regard by launching an entrepreneurship doctoral
programme in the country. As an academic stakeholder of start-up
ecosystem, the main objective is to groom potential scholars in various
facets of entrepreneurship and encourage inter-disciplinary studies in
management research. The entrepreneurial research tends to intensify the
efforts put in by other stakeholders in the eco-system viz - private
equity players, academicians, industry mentors, angel investors and
incubation centres.

Innovation is already a corner-stone for most of the entrepreneurs in
India as is evident from a recent report by Global Entrepreneurship
Monitor (GEM).

According to GEM report India is one of the top countries with highest
rate (47%) of prevalence of innovation among entrepreneurs.

Despite this, not many innovations see light of the day as they lack
basic empirical research.

This is evident from the number of projects that come out of engineering
and technical institutes of India every year, but do not get translated
into a tangible business idea.

The Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, is
working in the direction of converting engineering projects into
business ideas. It has launched an institutional mechanism - The NewGen
Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (NewGen IEDC).

Under this, the Department of Science and Technology is helping
educational institutions to develop institutional mechanism to create
entrepreneurial culture in Science &#38; Technology (S&#38;T) academic
institutions and to foster techno-entrepreneurship for generation of
wealth and employment by S&#38;T persons. Entrepreneurship Development
Institute of India is the only coordinating agency for this project of
Department of Science and Technology.

The central government is contemplating extending its support to over
2,500 projects from 40 academic institutions over a period of five
years, which began two years ago.

This entire mechanism is dependent on insightful research to create new
enterprises.

However, this mechanism cannot alone revive research. Academic
institutions will have to take the ownership and shoulder the
responsibility of generating scholars and business consultants that
assist the startups in converting their ideas into business in least
possible time and highest possible success ratio.

World: Will the coronavirus mean failure for African startups?

Thai News Service

March 31, 2020 Tuesday

Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved

Section: BUSINESS NEWS

Length: 771 words

Body

African startups have on average a roughly 50% chance of making it,
according to a report. But country figures differ significantly, and the
ongoing COVID-19 scare could hurt the continent's entrepreneurs.

Startups in Africa have a better chance of making it than their peers in
the US or India, according to a recent report called "Tracing the
success and failure of African startups," by Greentec Capital Africa
Foundation and WeeTracker. African startups founded and operated from
2010 to 2018 had a 54% chance of failing. That's lower than 67% for the
US and India's 90% for firms set up around the same time period.

But the situation varies significantly across the continent. At 25%,
Mozambique was the African nation with the lowest failure rate. In other
countries, the likelihood of winding down operations were much higher.

The failure rate may be an indicator of the amount of activity in a
startup ecosystem, according to WeeTracker's Nayantara Jha.

"One reason for a low failure rate on a macro level is the [high] number
of startups in a market," she explains.

Money isn't everything. Resources may even play a more significant role
in determining success, says Festerling. That's something he has
observed in his work with Greentec, which supports entrepreneurs across
several African countries.

"It's quite difficult to get the [required] skill set in the team, and
the resources and technology that you need," Festerling explains. "A
partner that supports [a startup] operationally can actually be more
valuable than a big funding round," he adds.

Hard times ahead

African startups have been raising more money every year, with 2019
reaching a record that exceeded $1 billion (900 million) for the first
time. The outlook for 2020 was also optimistic until the coronavirus
became a global pandemic. The economic fallout from the COVID-19
outbreak will hurt African tech firms. The "supply of money" is now the
biggest concern, says Moses Acquah of Afrolynk, an organization that
supports African entrepreneurs.

The continent's countries are now slowly closing borders and imposing
lockdowns, with Rwanda and South Africa leading the way last week. While
these measures may help stem rising coronavirus infections, they will
also hurt economies. That has been the experience in other markets. The
latest US unemployment figures surged to 3.3 million from 280,000 a week
earlier. Experts have linked them to movement restriction and business
closures amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The same could happen in Africa.

"[Startups] need to pay salaries, they need to generate revenue," Acquah
says. "But revenue comes from customers who are most likely to be laid
off," he adds.

Preparing for SARS-CoV-2 fallout

Economists expect a global economic slowdown. Earlier in March, the UN's
Economic Commission for Africa said the continent's GDP growth would
slow to 1.8% from 3.2% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some startups could
benefit from the lockdowns, especially those working in areas such as
health and education technology. However, investors are set to become
more cautious.

"Both the venture capitals and business angels will look much more
closer at the companies [to see] if they've done their homework," says
Greentec CEO, who also invests in African startups.

He believes potential investors will try to determine whether a company
has what it takes to get through the ongoing crisis.

African businesses will need to demonstrate they can chart their way
through oncoming economic slowdown. Government support is extremely
unlikely. Last week, African finance ministers sent a letter asking for
$100 billion from the IMF, the World Bank and the ECB. Two-fifths of
that amount would go to debt servicing. The rest would be used to help
the health and social systems cope with the economic fallout from
COVID-19. Saving startups won't be high on the agenda.

Still, experts say African firms can take advantage of some policy
changes. Policymakers are already trying to counter the imminent
slowdown. Some central banks cut key interest rates, thereby reducing
the cost of borrowing. That could allow companies to line up enough
credit to make it through this crisis.

Greentec has been advising the African startups it works with to ensure
they have enough liquidity for 12 to 18 months. CEO Festerling has been
telling the firms to take a proactive stance. They need to make their
situation transparent to all different stakeholders, including landlords
who may have to wait longer for the rent, he says.

"It's important to really identify what can be done to survive the
corona crisis," Festerling warns.

InsurTech Start-up LandscapeMarket - What's New Trending For 2018 -
2022?

Apr 23, 2018( MarketersMedia News Hub:
http://marketersmedia.com/news-hub Delivered by Newstex) Pune, India,
23rd April 2018: WiseGuyReports announced addition of new report, titled
'InsurTech Start-up Landscape'. Pune , India - April 23, 2018
/MarketersMedia/ — SynopsisInsurtech start-ups[1] are emerging as the
insurance industry is waking up to the technological advancements
customers have come to expect from other industries. The banking sector
has been transformed and disrupted greatly by financial technology
(fintech), but insurance technology (insurtech) remains a long way
behind and a very different proposition, despite recent progress.
Funding to insurtech start-ups surpassed US$1.0 billion halfway through
2016, highlighting the progress made. However, substantial improvements
remain essential in basic areas such as mobile websites and apps, while
more innovative areas such as blockchain and the Internet of things
(IoT) have the capacity to revolutionize the industry. GET SAMPLE REPORT
@  
https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/759657-insurtech-start-up-landscape[2]
; The vast majority of insurance start-ups are looking to partner with
current insurers, as opposed to challenging them.

Areas such as customer engagement - particularly improving processes and
platforms, increasing efficiency and reducing administration costs - or
helping with regulation are the main areas where start-ups are having
success.Looking to challenge the incumbents is extremely difficult,
predominantly due to the capital required to underwrite insurance. The
most successful start-ups have been identifying insurers' weaknesses,
and working alongside them to make improvements. Technology investment
is a major priority for global insurers, Axa, Allianz, Munich Re and
Swiss Re have established their own capital venture funds, with a
ringfenced budget to invest in new technologies and start-ups. There
have been over 80 separate investments in start-ups already as of July
2016, with the year on course to finish with a 42% increase in the
number of deals compared to 2015. Partnering with insurtech start-ups is
ideal for large companies which do not have to take on the risk of
development. It is also easier for an incumbent to drop a start-up after
outsourcing if it does not work out, or if regulations change, than to
get rid of a whole department. These companies often struggle with
creating the right atmosphere for true innovation, largely due to
in-built processes and a reluctance to tolerate failure. Almost all
start-up activity is occurring in the non-life sector, and particularly
in motor, home and health insurance. The life market is not exactly
primed for innovation, with huge capital requirements, very little
customer engagement and heavy regulation, although quantified self is an
area to watch. Non-life, on the other hand, is a much more active
segment, with the increased use of data, in particular, starting to have
an impact in terms of both tailored policies and even preventative
measures. The switch from insurance companies offering financial cover
following a claim, to a valuable service, that customers interact with
regularly and benefit from greatly, is already happening to an extent,
but is set to become mainstream. Examples include telematics as a way to
reward good driving, while both health wearables and connected homes
look to identify problems before they occur. SummaryGlobally, start-ups
received US$1.8 billion in funding in the 12 months to June 2016 - down
20.97% on the previous year - although there were 150 deals in that
period, which represented a 44.2% rise on the year before. The
substantially more deals being done in the last year and less overall
funds being raised is due to an increase in angel investments and
early-stage deals, with 48% of deals last year being angel investments.
This is because Axa, Allianz, Munich Re, and Swiss Re have established
capital venture funds; usually with a budget of around US$100 million to
look into investing in innovation and start-ups. Zhong An, China's first
digital insurer and its best-funded InsurTech startup to date, received
US$931 million in 2015, which represented a considerable percentage of
the total for that period. ScopeThe vast majority of insurance start-ups
are seeking to enable insurers, not disrupt them.The industry is very
difficult to break into due to competition at an underwriting level, the
amount of funds needed and the level of regulation. This means that most
insurtech start-ups are targeting the consumer engagement side of the
business - improving the processes or helping with regulation and
therefore aiming to partner with incumbent insurers. Motor, health and
home insurance are the main areas where innovation has thrived, and
relative success has been seen in the use of wearable Fitbits,
telematics and connected homes. All three are at relatively early stages
of development, but have already seen strong consumer engagement, which
is set to increase substantially over the next five years. Reasons to

the banks ans financial institutions, insurtech start-ups have generally
been looking to work with insurers and improve their weakest areas. •
The non-life lines, motor and property in particular, are well ahead of
other lines of insurance, in terms of both use of technology and
start-up penetration. • The incumbent insurers are becoming more and
more keen to work with start-ups, with several substantial deals being
completed globally over the past couple of years. Table of Content: Key

10 Biggest Challenges Faced By Startups In The First Year Of Execution!

Trak.in

February 8, 2018 Thursday 6:30 AM EST

Copyright 2018 Trak.in, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved

Byline: Guest

Body

Most founders just run with an idea without a careful analysis and
without considering the challenges faced by a startup in the first year.

Starting a business can admittedly prove to be quite the preoccupying
and yet extremely gratifying endeavour. A start-up, to most people, is a
precious opportunity to turn their passions into a palpable reality.
However, the path towards this envisioned future is rarely easy. In
fact, just the first year of a startup can pose unimagined challenges
and complications.

To tell the truth, the first 18 months of a start-up's life is often
referred to as 'the valley of death' since most start-ups end up go to
the wall during this period. So, if you are just starting out in the
world of start-ups or are deliberating establishing one, here is a list
of the 10 biggest challenges you are likely to face in the first year of
your start-up's execution:

Contents

* 1 Identifying The Right Founder-Market Fit

* 2 Building The Right Team

* 3 Not Talking To End-Customers And Others

* 4 Not Understanding The Difference Between Users And Customers

* 5 Focusing On Vanity Metrics Instead Of Metrics That Actually Have An
Impact On The Business

* 6 Not Thinking About The Bigger Picture

* 7 Executing Too Slowly

* 8 Not Experimenting Often Or Enough

* 9 Trying To Do Too Many Things At Once

* 10 Not Accepting Failures

Identifying The Right Founder-Market Fit

One of the most fundamental aspects of establishing a start-up is
ensuring that you get the founder-market (or founder-problem) fit right.
Unfortunately, a lot of founders simply take the most seemingly gainful
idea and run with it without taking the time to assess if they are the
right person with right skills to solve the problem.

It is important that founders resonate with the problem really well in
order to be able to solve it.

Building The Right Team

The second most important step in a start-up's journey is to find the
right team that can solve the problem. The team the founder puts
together should complement their skills and talents and more importantly
connect with their vision of building the startup. The team needs to be
equally passionate about the problem being solved.

Not Talking To End-Customers And Others

A large number of founders tend to work on their start-ups discretely,
which means they end up spending too much time building what they think
is right. Unfortunately, not discussing the idea with others and
validating your beliefs/ assumptions, often leads to 'analysis
paralysis'.

It is imperative for founders to share their thoughts, talk to
customers, and seek feedback for more clarity on what needs to be solved
and how.

Not Understanding The Difference Between Users And Customers

Focusing on building a user base instead of concentrating on the paying
customer base early on during a start-up's life is a move that is most
likely to have a disastrously damaging effect on the endeavour. Many
founders end up chasing users who would never turn to customers.

Focusing On Vanity Metrics Instead Of Metrics That Actually Have An
Impact On The Business

Start-ups often tend to focus on vanity metrics such as app downloads
and page visits or Facebook likes instead of paying attention to metrics
that really impact the business. Metrics such as the page visits are
relevant to startups in media and not startups in other spaces unless
page visit directly correlates with business goals. Often people confuse
on what metrics really impact business and lose focus.

Not Thinking About The Bigger Picture

It is important to keep an eye on the bigger picture/thought process to
grow as a start-up. Think of it as the North Star for your goals - it
will help you make the right decisions while you forge the path towards
the future. The vision is important for the founding team to align all
forces in that direction.

Executing Too Slowly

Start-ups must act fast during the nascent stages. Why? Because
considering the probabilities of failures, start-ups need to fail fast
in order to learn and then correct themselves quickly. The biggest enemy
of a startup is lost time.

Not Experimenting Often Or Enough

Nearly all start-ups deviate considerably from the original plan.
Unfortunately, most founders end up sticking to the original hypothesis
by assuming instead of validating it through enough experiments. Most of
the startups end up pivoting thus making the right experiments all the
more important.

Trying To Do Too Many Things At Once

There is no doubt that experimenting is good for the start-up's health.
However, overdo it and you risk hurting your start-up. But also remember
to evaluate the experiments and their results thoroughly before
discarding it or adopting it.

Not Accepting Failures

In the world of startups, failures are a more common occurrence than
success stories. As a start-up's founder, one must accept failures,
rejections, and naysayers and then move on to building the startup
ahead.

To a lot of people, the mere idea of establishing your own startup
sounds fantastical for it means you get to pursue our own vision, do
things your own way and make your own rules. However, the path towards
this envisioned future is rarely easy. But knowing, understanding, and
anticipating the barriers you may face in the first year of your startup
execution can not only help you be prepared to successfully overcome
these challenges but possibly also steer clear of some common stumbling
blocks.

Federal workplace safety investigators found that a construction
companys failure to prevent sudden start-up of a conveyor system
contributed to an 18-year-old workers fatal injuries after he was pulled
into a hot asphalt silo as he tried to remove debris from the conveyor
in Oklahoma City on Nov. 2, 2021.

The U.S. Department of Labors Occupational Safety and Health
Administration opened an inspection at TJ Campbell Construction Co. and
determined the conveyor system was not locked out/tagged out to avoid
accidental startups. OSHA issued willful citations for failing to
develop and use procedures for controlling hazardous energy when
servicing or cleaning the asphalt conveyor system, and not training
workers adequately on requirements for controlling hazardous energy.

A young worker was barely three months on the job when his life was
tragically cut short, said OSHA Area Director Steven Kirby in Oklahoma
City. Had TJ Campbell Construction Company provided their workers with
the required training on controlling hazardous energy and ensuring
proper shutdown before any attempt to remove debris was made, this young
man would have ended his workday safely.

In addition to the willful citations, OSHA cited the company for the
following:

Permitting unguarded pulleys, chain and sprockets on walking and working
surfaces.

Failing to apply energy isolation devices.

Missing handrails on stairways.

Uncovered holes in the floor of walking working surfaces.

TJ Campbell Construction Company faces proposed penalties totaling
$370,347.

Based in Edmond, T.J. Campbell Construction, a subsidiary of DUIT
Holdings Inc., is an asphalt and concrete paving contractor. The company
has experience with highway, street and site infrastructure for
commercial developments, as well as construction services for
construction and reconstruction.

The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and
penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHAs area
director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational
Safety and Health Review Commission.

Start-ups. This is in collaboration with the IIT, Madras Incubation Cell
(IITMIC) Shri K Ananth Krishnan, EVP & CTO, Tata Consultancy Services
launched the product in the presence of Shri Debasish Panda (IAS),
Secretary, Financial Services, MOF, GOI.

Speaking on the occasion, Ms.Padmaja Chunduru, MD & CEO said that "it is
a known fact that Banks find it difficult to fund start-ups, as they do
not meet the requirements under traditional models of financing. The
business models involving high technology, the lack of visibility of
cash flows, credit history, the high burn rate, the high failure rate
among start-ups make the process of due diligence for assessing
viability by banks difficult. Resultantly, this segment has been almost
completely funded by Seed Capital, or Private Equity from India /
abroad. Both the GOI and RBI have been constantly bringing in enablers
to help this ecosystem.

Indian Bank stepped in to bridge this gap in funding for start ups
through this collaboration with IITMIC. Under the MOU, IITMIC will refer
start ups with proven technology and established cash flows to the bank
and also extend advisory to bank on the business model. The Bank will
extend loans of up to Rs. 50 crores to these start ups for their working
capital requirements or purchase of machinery, equipment etc. As the
name goes, this initiative, we believe will be the spring board for
start ups to realise their ambitions. We see this collaboration as a
perfect fit both for the Bank and IITMIC. She also recalled that Bank
has recently launched "MSME Prerana" programme to empower MSME
entrepreneurs through skill development and capacity building workshops
in local languages.

Shri Debasish Panda (IAS), Secretary, Financial Services, MOF

amalgamation of Allahabad Bank into Indian Bank. He said that lot of
initiatives have been taken by Indian Bank premerger and also post
merger. He congratulated Indian Bank for launching IND Spring the new
model for financing start-ups, which will be a game changer in Banking
Industry.

In his address, Dr.Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Co-Chairman, IIT
Madras-Incubation Cell praised the efforts taken by the Indian Bank Team
in finalising the agreement/MOU very quickly. For start-ups, working
capital is a bottleneck, since they don't have collateral and the
entrepreneurs are also not in a position to provide personal guarantee.
By launching "IND Spring Board" , Indian Bank has proved that it
certainly cares for these entrepreneurs. This is a proud moment for the
whole country.

While launching IND Spring Board, Shri K Ananth Krishnan, EVP and CTO,
TCS lauded the initiative of Indian Bank and said that Start ups have
the advantage of credit facility like Ind Spring Board now. At present,
we are in 4th Industrial Revolution with various technologies emerging.

category. TCS also works through Co-Innovation (COIN) with start ups
across the globe.

The e- launch was attended by Board of Directors of Indian Bank,
customers of the Bank and representatives from print & electronic media.

Sanjay Kumar of Memestic Shared 5 Tips for Young Entrepreneurs to Start
Off

The reality is that you can easily do numerous things with less hassle
at a young age so as to start a profitable and better business. On the
off chance, if presently your mindset is not ready for starting a
business then also you can, with less efforts, do many things at a young
age. What? Can learn things that can boost the growth of the business
later on!

Nowadays, generally every person's dream is to start their own business
and no doubt, there's nothing wrong in that. What can be much better
than doing work for yourself and under no one as you will be your own
manager?

Obviously, bouncing into the world of business can be quite scary
particularly if you have seen that the majority of new companies fail.
Fortunately, the reality is that failure rates of start-ups are not that
much high particularly if you make utilization of correct strategies to
start your business.

So, now the question is what youthful entrepreneurs can do to improve
their probability of success? Sanjay Kumar of Memestic has shared few
tips that young entrepreneurs can follow. Let's dive into these amazing
and useful tips!

* Find your passion

The successful start-ups no doubt are established by individuals who are
avid about the things they do. Think about your passions! Work really
becomes interesting when you do things you love the most! List few
things you really adore the most. For instance, if you like painting
then you can try becoming a great art dealer or if you are fond of music
then create an app focused on music etc.

The fact is when a person does something with full confidence from their
heart then victory will run towards them automatically. When one does
something, they are not really comfortable with then there are chances
that it may result in failure.

Take enough time and don't rush. Try numerous things first in order to
discover what you like the most and then begin the journey of an
entrepreneur. This what makes different entrepreneurs successful.

* Know your market well

Failing to comprehend the market is the topmost reason start-ups fail.
In order to increase the likelihood of success, you first need to
research the target market thoroughly before launching the business.

Might be you are wondering why, isn't it? This will only help you in
identifying vital attributes like value point as well as advertising
messages. The better a person comprehends their target market; simpler
it can be to evade expensive misfires.

* Get your finances in order

While numerous start-ups enrol the assistance of angel speculators for
running the business, you can't think that you will also get that kind
of monetary assistance. Numerous entrepreneurs have to make use of their
own assets to begin their company. It implies you must do all that you
can easily do for improving your monetary situation.

Start with building credit and try to pay off complete student loans as
well as other debts. It will help you only and makes the process of
getting the loan easier that you may need for your start-up.

* Find a mentor

Running any business whether small or big requires skills as well as
expertise. Don't try to take any decision on own which is related to
your business. So, in such a case, finding an experienced mentor is what
you need!

Mentors had already gone through these phases in their time and they
have enough knowledge as well as experience to help you make better
business decisions. Make use of alumni networks, meetings as well as
other resources in order to form valuable connections.

* Tune-up your business knowledge

You might be eager about your huge plan; however, this innovative
vitality is not sufficient. Successful businesses generally require a
skilful team of people so as to manage funds, tasks, manufacturing,
advertising and so on.

Take your time to improve the IQ of your business and search for
likeminded people who are eager to join your group. By giving the same
amount of attention to business things just as the inventive side can
help you in establishing foundations for your start-up that persists.

Wrap Up

Hope you have enjoyed reading this article and it helped you in knowing
more about the tips shared for young entrepreneurs to start off.

For a young entrepreneur, starting a business is exciting yet
challenging too. Follow the above-given tips shared by him and reach the
heights of success you always dreamt of.

The state of entrepreneurial research in India

Hindustan Times

May 22, 2019 Wednesday

Copyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 949 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, May 22 -- India has always had a rich culture of
entrepreneurship which is evident from the number of family businesses
that operated in pre-independence era and thrived over a period of four
to five decades till the country gained its freedom. The creation of
enterprises continued, albeit on a slower pace and confined to only few
communities known primarily for their risk-taking abilities.

These communities, with trading mind-set, believed in short-term profit
generation and never looked at scaling up their businesses.

However, later in the years post-independence, entrepreneurial
enthusiasm took a dip as government chose to take control of
manufacturing facilities and basic financial services. The technology
boom of late 90s and early 2000 again fuelled the entrepreneurship boom
as government had taken various steps to withdraw their role from
regulating private businesses.

Since technology boom, the entrepreneurship vigour has continuously been
on the uptrend as the millennials and Generation Z build up an
innovation-based economy that promises sustainable growth solution. The
Government of India's initiative of 'Start-up India' and commitment to
improve country's ranking in 'Ease of Doing Business' globally since
last few years have fastened this movement, thereby catapulting the
economy into a higher growth zone.

While, initially the failure rate of start-ups was high due to reasons
such as inadequate funding, unviability of business idea and meager
opportunities in terms of reach to target markets, the scenario is
changing gradually. As stakeholders of start-up ecosystem come together
to help startups grow and survive the onslaught of early turbulence,
India is increasingly becoming an ideal start-up hub.

Academic institutions play a vital role in shaping up the start-up
ecosystem in any country.

The thriving start-up culture in the country in the last decade has
brought a disruption in entrepreneurial education. Since last few years,
premier management and technical institutions have started focusing on
entrepreneurial aspects, thereby nurturing their students' dream of
enterprise creation.

However, not many institutions focus on providing a fullfledged
entrepreneurship course.

Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII) is perhaps the
first institute in India that pioneered the concept of entrepreneurship
education, way back in early 1980s.

So far, 1,486 students have graduated from the Institute with a 78%
success rate either in new enterprise creation or diversification of
family business. Entrepreneurship education creates the base of a strong
start-up ecosystem as it addresses the fundamental issues before the
idea is born.

However, along with education, the ecosystem also requires strong
research creation that focuses on filling the gaps of availability of
trained educators, researchers, business consultants and resource
persons in entrepreneurship at higher learning institutions /
professional organisations / government departments / industry in India.

The cadre of academicians thus created, will raise the standard of
education and research, thereby ensuring wider acceptance of
entrepreneurship as a career option in the society.

EDII has also taken an initiative in this regard by launching only
Entrepreneurship doctoral programme in the country. As an academic
stakeholder of start-up ecosystem, the main objective is to groom
potential scholars in various facets of entrepreneurship and encourage
inter-disciplinary studies in management research.

The entrepreneurial research tends to intensify the efforts put in by
other stakeholders in the eco-system viz - private equity players,
academicians, industry mentors, angel investors and incubation centres.

Innovation is already a corner-stone for most of the entrepreneurs in
India as is evident from a recent report by Global Entrepreneurship
Monitor (GEM).

According to GEM report India is one of the top countries with highest
rate (47%) of prevalence of innovation among entrepreneurs.

Despite this, not many innovations see light of the day as they lack
basic empirical research.

This is evident from the number of projects that come out of engineering
and technical institutes of India every year, but do not get translated
into a tangible business idea.

Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, is
working in the direction of converting engineering projects into
business ideas. It has launched an institutional mechanism - The NewGen
Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (NewGen IEDC).

Under this, DST is helping educational institutions to develop
institutional mechanism to create entrepreneurial culture in Science
&#38; Technology (S&#38;T) academic institutions and to foster
techno-entrepreneurship for generation of wealth and employment by
S&#38;T persons. Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII)
is the only coordinating agency for this project of DST.

The government is contemplating to support over 2,500 projects from 40
academic institutions over a period of 5 years, which began 2 years
back.

This entire mechanism is dependent on insightful research to create new
enterprises.

However, this mechanism cannot alone revive research. Academic
institutions will have to take the ownership and shoulder the
responsibility of generating scholars and business consultants that
assist the start-ups in converting their ideas into business in least
possible time and highest possible success ratio.

The Chennai-headquartered bank seeks to bridge the gap in funding for
start-ups through this collaboration with IITMIC.

Under the deal, IITMIC will refer start-ups with proven technology and
established cash flows to the bank and also extend advisory to the bank
on the business model. The bank will extend loans of up to ₹50 crore to
these start-ups for their working capital requirements or purchase of

The initiative was digitally launched by K Ananth Krishnan, EVP and CTO,
Tata Consultancy Services, in the virtual presence of Debasish Panda,
Secretary, Financial Services, Union Ministry of Finance.

"IND Spring, the new model for financing start-ups, will be a
game-changer in the banking industry, said Panda.

"For start-ups, working capital is a bottleneck, since they don't have
collateral and the entrepreneurs are also not in a position to provide a
personal guarantee. By launching IND Spring Board, Indian Bank has

KEYWORDS: Sustainability, Start-up, Technological Capabilities, Business
Eco System, Radical Innovation.

INTRODUCTION:

India's Silicon Valley Bangalore has seen a huge number of start-ups
sprouting up in the last few years. Apart from Unicorns like Flipkart,
Inmobi, Mu Sigma, Bangalore is also home for some of the most innovative
companies. Several scientific studies have come to the conclusion that
start-ups bring needed impulses for change and innovation and have a
positive impact on economic growth and on labor markets (Gary S. Hansen,
1989). They are studied in courses about innovation and can even serve
as role models for the biggest enterprises. A start-up company is an
entrepreneurial venture which is typically a newly emerged, fast-growing
business that aims to meet a marketplace need by developing a viable
business model around an innovative product, service, process or a
platform. Startup will begin by building a first Minimum viable product
(MVP), and develop the new ideas or business concepts. Startups founders
do research to deepen their understanding of the ideas, technologies or
business concepts and their commercial potential (Antonio Davila, 2005).

Innovation considered as the application of better solutions that meet
new requirements or existing market needs. The term "innovation" can be
defined as something original and more effective which` "breaks into"
the market or society.

Startups failure and success depend on a countless number of factors.
Financing has been identified as a major factor in the success of most
startups. Most startups fail not because they lack financing but because
they do not have the foresight and good R&D team (George Foster, 2005).
It has been identified that financing is highly correlated with good
innovation. Many companies were not able to survive because they could
not keep up with the innovation cap in the market. Innovation can be
seen as a survival technique (Diane A. Isabelle, 2013).

Factors Influencing Sustainability of Startup Companies:

Business sustainability is often defined as managing the triple bottom
line - a process by which companies manage their financial, social and
environmental risks, obligations and opportunities. These three impacts
are sometimes referred to as profits, people and planet (Graham Hubbard,
2009).

Technological Capability and Performance:

Teece et al (1997) describe a "technological capability" as "the ability
to perform any relevant technical function or volume activity within the
organization including the ability to develop new products and processes
and to operate facilities effectively".

The ability of technological capability to control the ability of the
organization to perform should be a positive step for the organization
to gain the competitive edge over others. This implies that
technological capabilities will help the organization to efficiently
produce more products at the lowest cost possible thereby enhancing its
economies of scale (Nur Naha Abu Mansor, 2012).

Business Eco System:

A business ecosystem is the network of organizations - including
suppliers, distributors, customers, competitors, government agencies,
and so on - involved in the delivery of a specific product or service
through both competition and cooperation. The idea is that each entity
in the ecosystem affects and is affected by the others, creating a
constantly evolving relationship in which each entity must be flexible
and adaptable in order to survive, as in a biological ecosystem.

The business ecosystem consists of a network of interlinked companies
that dynamically interact with each other through competition and
cooperation to grow sales and survive, it means that the participants
have developed patterns of behavior that streamline the flow of ideas,
talent and capital throughout the system. Being a part of a business
ecosystem provides mechanisms to leverage technology achieve excellence
in research and business competence and compete effectively against
other companies (Ananya Raka Chakraborty, 2012).

Radical Innovation:

Radical innovation is an invention that destroys or supplants an
existing business model. Unlike architectural or incremental innovation,
radical innovation blows up the existing system or process and replaces
it with something entirely new (Frank de Langen, 2012)

A radical or disruptive innovation is an innovation that has a
significant impact on a market and on the economic activity of firms in
that market. This concept focuses on the impact of innovations as
opposed to their novelty. The innovation could, for example, change the
structure of the market, create new markets or render existing products
obsolete.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:

Businesses are a vital component of every economy. It creates job and
reduces the burden of many households. The number of launched Start-up
is very high and the number of start-ups that don't survive due to
various reasons also high. Factors such as environment, social,
technological, and political factors are known to be the most common
factors that cause the failure of most startups. Others such as
knowledge in the said area of startup, leadership skills, financing,
marketing, and promotion are also major factors which affect the
performance of the startups. Lack of Technology, Innovations and
digitalization are the main reasons for the failure of startup. Though
there are many research scholars addressed on the individual components
of startup performance. Hence this researcher is intended to few
parameters like Technological capabilities, Business eco-system, Radical
Innovations and their influencing factors so as to develop the
conceptual framework for the sustainability of start-up companies.

METHODOLOGY OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW:

It is indeed to analyze the various parameters which will bring out
measurability of the sustainability of startups. Hence various Scopus
indexed journals have been reviewed and the gaps identified are listed
as below.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK:

Through Literature survey author found that factors like Technical
capabilities, Business eco-system and Radical innovation influence as
got significant impact on the organization sustainability. Sustainable
growth encompasses a business model that creates value consistent with
the long-term preservation and enhancement of financial, environmental
and social capital. Hence through this review paper author would like to
propose a conceptual framework as shown in figure no 1.

RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS:

This study delivers three important repercussions for research. Firstly,
this study amplifies the literature of entrepreneurship by providing
comprehensive and a methodical information about the parameters
influencing the startup sustainability. The literature review reveals
the relationship between the various parameters responsible for the
startup sustainability. Among those parameters, three important
parameters such as Technological Capabilities, Business Eco-System and
Radical Innovations were identified.

Second, this study has helped to develop a conceptual framework taking
into consideration the independent parameters such as Technological
Capabilities, Business Eco-System and Radical Innovations for business
sustainability.

Third, survey questionnaire would be developed for the primary data
collection from the proposed targeted audience in Bengaluru.

CONCLUSION:

A methodical and significant review was conducted to give an in-depth
analysis of the parameters influencing the startup sustainability.
Various Scopus indexed journal articles from the year 2009 to 2017 were
considered for literature review. Based on the gaps identified from the
literature review, the independent parameters such as Technological
capabilities, Business Eco-system, Radical Innovations were derived. A
Conceptual framework for startup sustainability has been developed.

LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY:

This is study is limited to the review of literature from Scopus indexed
journals. As this is an ongoing research, the researcher might explore
the additional related journals with the identification of factors would
be taken forward for the next level.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

The author would like to thank Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences,
Bengaluru for having permitted to carry out the research and their
unflagging support during the tenure of my research.

lender Indian Bank has introduced 'IND Spring Board', an initiative for
funding start-ups, in collaboration with the IIT-Madras Incubation Cell
(IITMIC).The Chennai-headquartered bank seeks to bridge the gap in
funding for start-ups through this collaboration with IITMIC.Business
modelUnder the deal, IITMIC will refer start-ups with proven technology
and established cash flows to the bank, and also extend advisory to the
bank on the business model. The bank will extend loans of up to Rs.

50 crore to these start-ups for their working capital requirements or
purchase of machinery.'It is a known fact that banks find it difficult
to fund start-ups as they do not meet the requirements under traditional
models of financing. The business models involving high technology, the
lack of visibility of cash flows, credit history, the high burn rate and
the high failure rate among start-ups make the process of due diligence
for assessing viability by banks difficult. Resultantly, this segment
has been almost completely funded by seed capital, or private equity
from India/ abroad,' said Padmaja Chunduru, MD and CEO of Indian
Bank.'Spring board for start-ups''This initiative, we believe, will be
the spring board for start-ups to realise their ambitions. We see this
collaboration as a perfect fit both for the bank and IITMIC,' she
added.The initiative was virtually launched by K Ananth Krishnan, EVP
and CTO, Tata Consultancy Services, in the presence of Debasish Panda,
Secretary, Financial Services, Union Ministry of Finance.'IND Spring,
the new model for financing start-ups, will be a game-changer in the
banking industry,' said Panda.'For start-ups, working capital is a
bottleneck since they don't have collateral, and entrepreneurs are also
not in a position to provide a personal guarantee. By launching IND
Spring Board, Indian Bank has proved that it certainly cares for these
entrepreneurs,' said Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Co-Chairman, IIT

IIM Amritsar conducted First Edition of Entrepreneurship Summit in VC
mode

India Education Diary

Dateline: Amritsar

Body

Amritsar, Feb. 9 -- Indian Institute of Management, Amritsar,
successfully conducted the first edition of its E-Summit in
collaboration with the Centre of Entrepreneurship, IIM Amritsar on
February 7, 2021, in VC mode.

E-Summit 2021 brought together innovative and creative insights from
diverse backgrounds and talents across the country with the intent of
creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem. It served as a platform to
excite, encourage, and motivate people to venture into entrepreneurship
and help the participants realize their hidden potential. Many events
such as Start-Up Expo, upskilling workshops, and thought-provoking panel
discussions were conducted to inculcate the entrepreneurial spirit.

With workshops revolving around start-up curation, financing, valuation,
and business pitching, the summit provided the budding entrepreneurs
with a platform to learn the requisite skills. The event enabled the
start-ups to present their business ideas in front of potential
investors, industry experts, customers and helped them network with the
VCs and experts for funding together with an opportunity to interact
with the leading industry experts. It also hosted an insightful panel
discussion throwing light on a day in an entrepreneur's life.

The discussion was preluded with an insightful presentation by Mr.
Bhavin Shah (MBA06 batch) of the Placements' Committee highlighting the
glorious journey of IIM Amritsar. Mr. Shah highlighted how with its
emancipation in 2015, IIM Amritsar has reached from a batch strength of
44 students back then to 214 students now. He also elucidated the key
achievements of IIM Amritsar students in various national level
competitions as well as the top notch placements bagged by the students
in reputed firms.

The panel discussion was ennobled with the presence of Mr. Amit Hans
(Founder - Educorp Trainings), Mr. K Vaitheeswaran (Co-Founder - AGAIN
Drinks), Mr. Mandeep Singh (CEO & Executive Director - JSL Lifestyle
Limited), Mr. Rohit Raj (Co-Founder & Creative Chief, - The Glitch and
Chtrbox.com), Mr. Sharad Vivek Sagar (Founder & CEO - The Dexterity
Global Group) and, Mr. Sridhar Ranganathan (CEO - Helyxon Healthcare
Solutions).

Mr. Amit Hans was the moderator for the insightful panel discussion. He
highlighted how domain expertise isn't enough in an entrepreneurial
setting and that it is of utmost importance to look at the business from
different aspects. Mr. Hans talked about how an entrepreneur is a
salesperson right from the inception as the world of entrepreneurship
demands the entrepreneur to sell his/her idea at every point of the
journey. He emphasized that irrespective of whether a person starts as
an entrepreneur or as a working professional, "intrapreneurship" drives
success in an entrepreneurial ecosystem. Concluding the insightful
discussion, Mr. Hans added that intent, content, and trainability is
what is sought out of candidates when it comes to hiring in a start-up
environment.

Mr. K Vaitheeswaran accentuated the need for the budding entrepreneurs
to be ready to face the challenges and brace themselves for failure in a
start-up ecosystem. He added that being an entrepreneur can be a lonely
job wherein five days of the year would be great while the rest 360 will
be tough. And to cope with such a challenging environment, an
entrepreneur needs to take seven things to work on every day - mind,
body, heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears. Concluding his chain of
thoughts, Mr. Vaitheeswaran emphasized that pioneering work cannot be
done unless the budding entrepreneurs move out of their comfort zones
and try out different domains beyond their areas of expertise.

Mr. Mandeep Singh started with the thought that one gets to establish a
business in an entrepreneurial ecosystem wherein nobody knows what the
future holds. In the face of such uncertainty, selecting a sustainable
business model was deemed crucial. He added that understanding the
business's needs and molding the business model to satisfy the
customers' needs optimally is the necessity of the hour. Mr. Singh
concluded that entrepreneurs create something out of nothing, and hence
it is one of the most challenging jobs.

Mr. Rohit Raj started with the idea that domain expertise is over-rated
in a start-up world. The joy of working with start-ups and the journey
from nothing to something is what makes the entrepreneurial journey the
most exciting one. Mr. Raj added that to get into the entrepreneurial
journey, one must be comfortable with the state of being uncomfortable.
An uncomfortable space where success and failures both are very likely
is what creates an entrepreneur. Mr. Raj ended with a thought-provoking
statement that one could fall and fly when it comes to being an
entrepreneur, so it is worth taking the plunge.

Mr. Sharad Vivek Sagar emphasized that entrepreneurship is all about
problem-solving. And that it should aim towards solving the grass-root
level problems. Transformative stories have been the product of young
people translating their education into leadership and solving the
issues. Mr. Sagar emphasized that one of the essential things a young
entrepreneur should aim towards is delivering value. Value, once
created, can never be destroyed, and that is what drives the
entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Mr. Sridhar Ranganathan started with the idea of the analogy that while
it is lonely at the top, the view is breath-taking when you reach
there - Such is the life of an entrepreneur. Mr. Ranganathan added that
the prosperity of the nation depends on educationists and entrepreneurs.
If 100 entities are being created, 5% would be in the exit category, 90%
in the existing category, and only 5% would succeed and make an impact.
Mr. Ranganathan concluded with valuable insight that there are three
things an entrepreneur should always have in mind - An entrepreneur is
still smaller when compared to the organization, is always an extra who
with an ordinary team can produce extra-ordinary results) and is nothing
without the customers.

The students of IIM Amritsar showed great enthusiasm during the panel
discussion. The discussions were made highly interactive through a
healthy Q&A session between the panelists and students. The summit
concluded with a stand-up comedy session by the well-renowned comedian
Mr. Rahul Dua. The participants thoroughly enjoyed the outstanding
performance of Mr. Dua, and the summit ended on a positive note.

Startup India Seed Fund Scheme: Quintessential need for startups

In February of 2021, The Department for Promotion of Industry and
Industrial Trade (DPIIT) has notified the promulgation of the Startup
India Fund Scheme. This scheme instituted on 21st February 2021 contains
operational guidelines to provide financial assistance for proof of
concept, prototype development, product trials, etc. and also the
constitution of an expert advisory committee. The committee will be
responsible for the overall execution and supervision of the Startup
India Seed Fund Scheme. The said committee will evaluate select start-up
incubators, the incubators will provide them with the required reports
on a timely basis.

The committee members included representatives from DPIIT; H.K. Mittal,
Chairman; Financial Advisor, DPIIT; departments of biotechnology,
science and technology; Ministry of Electronics and Information
Technology; Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Niti Aayog.
Also, it has included experts members from the Startup ecosystem - Saji
Gopinath, IIM Kozhikode; Renuka Ramnath, Indian Private Equity and
Venture Capital Association; Padmaja Ruparel, Indian Angel Network;
Anjali Bansal, Avaana Capital; Sruthi Kannan, Cisco Launchpad and Dr
Apoorva Ranjan Sharma, Venture catalysts.

In a summit organized by DPIIT in the January of 2021, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi announced a Rupees 1000 crore seed fund for start-ups at
the Prarambh India International Summit. This summit had brought
together top-level policymakers, industry leaders, academia, investors,
fund managers, startups, and all relevant stakeholders from across the
globe. Interestingly, this Summit marks the 5th anniversary of Startup
India. The funds can be accessed through select incubators across the
country. The startups will be given a guarantee and that will enable
them to raise debt from the investors. The funds can be accessed through
select incubators across the country, and the startups will be given a
guarantee that they can raise debt henceforth. Under this scheme the
government will assist for:

* Product trials

* Prototype development

* Proof of concept

* Market entry and commercialization

The government will be "sector agnostic", that is, all startups will be
treated equally. However, there is a requirement that the startup cannot
be more than 2 years old as listed under DPIIT and hold commercial
viability. It should also be using technology for its core
product/service. Some other requirements include, 51% shareholding with
Indian promoters, should not have more than 10 lakh in monetary support
from the government. Also, the startup can avail of this scheme only
once. The startups will be selected based on their application on the
StartupIndia portal.

Why does this initiative hold weight?

* Given that this summit was held in partnership with BIMSTEC (Bay of
Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation)
countries, it will add weight to India's Foreign Policy. From the
economic angle, this implies increased trade, increased FDI, as well as
increased connectivity for the otherwise secluded North East enabling
better infrastructure.

* Given that a large number of youths are engaged in the start-up
sector, this central government incentives initiative will also
facilitate job creation in an otherwise job deficient economy. The
pandemic had brought about the uncertainty of job, education, and
entrepreneurship. But, this scheme could be a silver lining in an
otherwise prevailing gloomy atmosphere due to continued COVID 19 adverse
impact.

* Given that this mega-event attracted over 200 marquee speakers, it was
an opportunity for new players to attract domestic as well as
international investment. Networking of this scale will act as a
multiplier force for the start-up bandwidth of India.

* It will also send a message to the international investors and have
greater trust about the Ease of Doing Business in India.

* India is already known for its scientific and technological prowess.
Events and investments of this magnitude will enable more and more
start-ups to exhibit their novel ideas, innovations, and platform for
the development of innovative local products.

* Given the guarantee provided by the government, it will be easier for
start-ups to avail loans from banks and other financial institutions.

* It will enable the financial inclusion of women, who not only
constitute half of humanity but are essential to the economy of every
country.

* The seed funding can be used only for the purpose it is designated,
and not for creating any facilities. This enables a focus on product
development.

It can gauge the size of startups in India by looking at data upfront.
For instance, as per the #Startupindia website under the Ministry of
Commerce, India has 50,000 start-ups, expected to witness year-on-year
growth of 12-15%. They have enabled the Indian economy to survive in the
pandemic era and have been a crucial driving force in realizing the
vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. As per #startupindia under the Ministry of
Commerce, India has 50,000 start-ups, expected to witness year on year
growth of 12-15%. Given the huge potential of startups, it is only fair
that the government should begin with the seeding investment of this
magnitude.

It should be acknowledged that all startups do not attain commercial
success. The rate of failure of the startups is high and that is a fact
that we accept as real-life empirical evidence across the world. The
funds who invest in startups experience a high level of risk but at the
same time, the successful ones bring huge dividends to the entrepreneurs
and the investors. The investors gain due to market valuations and some
of the startups go on to become Unicorn in a short number of years.

A large number of unskilled youth will also need to be taught and learn
soft skills. The startups would have a challenge in hiring the right
talent, partnerships, striking the right deal, marketing and eventually
branding their products and solutions. All of these skills require the
right mentorship and guidance. Govt has initiatives like Startup India,
and this can act as a role model. At the same time, we do recognize that
a lot is left to be accomplished as for the size of India, we would need
dozens of such schemes to be implemented across the country.

Start-ups and employment generation

While the infant mortality rate among start-ups in the country is
increasingly high, they are contributing their might to light up the
employment scenario. IT veteran and former Infosys director TV Mohandas
Pai said India has about 30,000 start-ups currently employing about
3.5-4 lakh people. What is more, 5,000-plus such ventures keep sprouting
every year. He predicts that there will be 1 lakh active start-ups in
India by 2025 that employ about 32 lakh people. Start-ups received about
$13.65 billion funding last year, which have steadily built about $95
billion in value, according to him.

On the flipside, the failure of start-ups continues to be an enigma.
According to Pai, 60% of them may fail owing to various factors. Market
dynamics are changing so fast making it difficult for start-ups to keep
their strategies and business plans agile. They may be constrained to
show the profit within a finite period if additional funding is to be
sought.

While some start-ups bank heavily on the quickly changing government
policies, a given recipe for disaster, some ideas are well ahead of
their time. While most startups bootstrap their initial phase before
they are able to raise funds, increase in expenditure subsequently could
raise a question mark on their survival.

Only 25% of start-up firms reach a meaningful scale: Vani Kola

Newstex Blogs

May 24, 2021( The Hindu Business Line:
http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ Delivered by Newstex)

The founder of Kalaari Capital Advisors shares her thoughts on start-up
firms and India's current position in the ecosystem

Vani Kola returned to India in 2006 after a successful career as an
entrepreneur in Silicon Valley and started Indo-US Venture Partners,
which was re-named six years later as Kalaari Capital Advisors. The
re-branded firm started operations as a $150-million fund in 2012, and
has made more than 30 investments across e-commerce, gaming, digital
content and healthcare sectors, and its success is synonymous with names
such as Dream11, Myntra and Snapdeal among others. A proponent for
India's digital opportunity to create next-generation large-scale
companies, Kola's investment philosophy is derived from her
entrepreneurial ventures. In an interview with BusinessLine , Kola, the
Founder and Managing Director of Kalaari Capital, equates start-ups with
extreme sports that are prone to failures, and talks about the new Rs.
1,700-crore fund. Excerpts:

To begin with, how has Covid-19 impacted the industry on the funding
front?

The pandemic has accelerated the digital signature, and companies
dependent on the digital economy have significantly benefited. In the
first few months of this year, we saw about $6.5 billion of growth
investments coming into these firms.

The digital acceleration favours the start-up community because they are
the 'disruption economy'.

The new companies focussed on technology 'enablement' can get Seed and
Series-A funding, as those two volumes on the barbell have stayed
strong.

The middle-child problem is for companies scouting for Series B and C
funding, while that in Seed and Series A space are vibrant, and the
digital-first firms are also doing fine. The crisis is also sometimes an
opportunity, as the start-up ecosystem has been vibrant in the first
quarter, with close to 300 companies getting funds. There is definitely
sunshine on this industry.

On the start-up front, we are only seeing the bright side of the story -
India already has 40 Unicorns. What about the failures?

A start-up is like an extreme sport. You should expect significant
failures, which is the name of the game, not just in India but globally.
Idea-to-execution and founder-to-leader are journeys, and the
fascination is because it is a great story - a David and Goliath story.
It is about human triumph and human vulnerability. At least 50 per cent
of the companies will not even get any funding, and of the remaining
that get funding, maybe 25 per cent will reach a meaningful scale, of
which, only 10 per cent will hit home-runs.

What is Kalaari Capital's strategy on investments?

We are passionate about early-stage investing and the early-stage
economy. For us, the privilege is discovering that founder who has a
great idea, potential and needs to be supported and then deliver
extraordinary value.

We want to be the lead investor in those companies with first-time
founders looking to raise risk capital, who have great ideas and who
want to build great companies. That hasn't changed in the last 15 years.

So, new markets keep emerging, and we will continue to build to those
themes, but being a lead investor in Seed or Series-A from
technology-leveraged opportunities with the right founders will not
change in the next decade for Kalaari. Typically, we invest in about ten
companies a year.

Kalaari Capital is believed to have roped in Jio Platforms as an LP for
its fourth fund?

I am proud of the returns we have generated to date, and even in Fund-I
(2006), we returned 2.7 times, which is high even by global standards.

We have already returned all the invested capital from our Fund II and
our opportunity fund, and both those funds are tracking to four times
return.

With the fourth fund, we want to do better than that in the past. This
is a Rs. 1,700-crore fund, of which, we have closed about Rs. 800 crore.
The rest we are not actively raising funds due to the pandemic, but it
will be raised within the stipulated time.

You invested in companies that were almost written off and turned them
around. How would you explain that?

Maybe, we see something that others don't see when it comes to
investment. We spend a lot of time understanding a company, and if we
develop the conviction for the company and the person, then we invest in
them and stay invested for a long time. We also look at all other stuff
that might have happened before, not just the Cinderella becoming the
princess story.

Indian Start-ups Need 'Growth Hackers' to Sustain

Business World

In 2017, a study conducted by the IBM Institute for Business Value and
Oxford Economics revealed that 90% of start-ups in India fail within the
first 5 years of their establishment. The study highlighted that the
'lack of innovation' is the prime reason for the failure of an Indian
start-up. Interestingly, most new Indian ventures are prone to
imitations and mimicry, according to 77% of venture capitalists who
responded to the study. The findings are based on a survey filled by
Indian entrepreneurs, Venture Capitalists (VCs), government leaders,
academicians and other corporate leaders.

Today, when establishing a business set-up in India has become easier
while sustaining the start-up for long has become challenging, a 'growth
hacker', who has become the new VP of marketing in the Silicon Valley
seems to be the ultimate saviour.

Who's a growth hacker, though?

A few years ago, a famous technologist and entrepreneur Andrew Chen
wrote in his article titled Growth Hacker Is the New VP of Marketing,
"Growth hackers are a hybrid of marketer and coder, one who looks at the
traditional question of "How do I get customers for my product?" and
answers with A/B tests, landing pages, viral factor, email
deliverability, and Open Graph. On top of this, they layer the
discipline of direct marketing, with its emphasis on quantitative
measurement, scenario modeling via spreadsheets, and a lot of database
queries."

Intrigued and a bit shocked to read about Andrew's views on the changed
role of marketeers, now a famous author and entrepreneur Ryan Holiday
who was then the Director of marketing at American Apparel started to
explore and dig down this topic of 'growth hacking' further. In his book
Growth Hacker Marketing, Ryan defines a growth hacker as, "someone who
has thrown out the playbook of traditional marketing and replaced it
with only what is testable, trackable, and scalable. Their tools are
e-mails, pay-per-click ads, blogs, and platform APIs instead of
commercials, publicity, and money. They are the inventors, operators,
and mechanics of their own self-sustaining and self-propagating growth
machine that can take a start-up from nothing to something."

However, how a growth hacker helps a new product or a company achieve a
growth is every time different.

For instance, as Ryan featured in his book, the investor of Hotmail Tim
Draper's idea of writing 'P.S.: I love you. Get your free e-mail at
Hotmail' at the bottom of each free message sent through the service
helped the company post an exponential growth-two million users in just
five weeks. It was the growth hacking idea built in the product itself
to allow the users to attract more users.

So, how can a growth hacker help an Indian start-up achieve growth and
not fail?

The first and the foremost step of growth hacking, as per Ryan's book,
is to achieve Product Market Fit (PMF) by thinking about the people who
are going to become your customers. A marketeer has to get involved in
the product development stage itself and think from the customers'
perspectives. After all, customers are the one who are going to use it.
Based on data, information, and feedback, you should keep iterating the
product until it gets to PMF. The first goal of a growth hacker is to
"have the product and its customers in perfect sync with each other."
The first step, thus, for an Indian start-up growth hacker is to get to
PMF.

Then comes the next responsibility: Finding your growth hack. It's a
trick to first attract few, core customers and then getting them to
beget new ones. In the process, incentivise the initial customers
heavily. While you want them to do you a favour, do not let them feel,
they are doing one. Rather, reward them. Please note that every product
needs a different growth hack. For one product, it could be bringing the
influencers on-board while for others it could be setting up a blog
post. So, after you get your PMF, find your growth hack and make your
product viral by asking your initial customers to share.

Last and the topmost responsibility of a growth hacker is to make your
customers stay. Great on-boarding experience, regular follow-ups, and
frequent offers will help you retain customers. Keep guiding them.
Giving them more. Make them come back. For more tricks, read Ryan's
book.

The point is, in every step of growth hacking, the growth hacker intends
to improve something by thinking innovatively. Indian start-ups,
therefore, need 'growth hackers' to help them improve the product and
achieve the desired business success.

Here are top five 'Budget Asks' from the digital sector

Asian News International (ANI)

January 30, 2018 Tuesday

Body

New Delhi [India], Jan 30 (ANI): The Internet and Mobile Association of
India (IAMAI) highlighted five key tax related challenges that the
digital sector expects to be addressed in the Budget announcements.

These five issues have been widely regarded as the biggest impediments
towards the growth of the digital sector and are critical for the entire
start-up ecosystem.

Angel Tax:

Share premium paid by investors for subscribing to shares in a private
company is taxable in the hands of the company at 30 percent (exclusive
of surcharge and cess) if and to the extent it is more than the FMV.

The main issue of contention is the valuation of the company or
calculating Fair Market Value [FMV] under Section 56(2). Valuation is
based on valuation certificate by a valuer recognized by the government.
Valuers in India look at traditional methods of valuation which apply to
mature companies with regular cash flows.

Valuation of start-ups is a critical factor given that intellectual
property and other intangibles involved at the start-up stage. Most
technology start-ups raise money before monetization and there is no
underlying actual cash flow analysis available for traditional valuation
methods. Most start-ups are almost always asset light and do not have
assets in their books to justify their intrinsic value.

Tax authorities refuse to accept Discounted Free Cash Flow (DCF) Method
for calculating valuation of start-ups, even as that is most common
process of valuation and is recognized under Rule UA(2) as one of the 2
methods of valuation for unquoted equity shares. Consequently, in many
cases the authorities calculate FMV to be as low as Rs. 1 or even Rs. 0,
leading to high tax demands.

While the original regulation has exception provisions for start-ups,
the eligible criterion for start-up has numerous conditions like maximum
turnover of Rs. 25 crores, maximum five years of existence, nature of
business. A critical criterion is certification of eligible start-ups by
the Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification. The fact that since 2016
only 74 start-ups have been certified 'eligible' by the
Inter-Ministerial board highlights the ineffectiveness of the exception
provisions.

The association stated that while the digital sector is not averse to
paying taxes, taxation should be on actualised gains and not notional
gains. Given the high rate of failure of start-ups, this is a critical
aspect of taxing the fast evolving tech sector; or we run the risk of
killing the goose even before it lays a golden egg!

Taxation of ESOPs:

For digital start-ups initiating at an uncertain stage, ESOPs is the
most common and popular incentive offered to employees at the stage of
scaling up of business. From the employees' perspective, in the context
of liquidity of their stock, there is an expectation that the company
may go public or may be acquired by a bigger player. This allows
companies to attract best talents who are also willing to take the risk
of joining a start-up.

Typically, most ESOPs have a vesting period (during which the employee
should continue to be in the employment of the company) and after
completion of the vesting period, the employee may exercise his option
to acquire shares by paying an exercise price. Under present provisions,
at the time of such exercise of options and grant of shares, the
difference between the 'FMV' of the shares and the exercise price paid
is taxed in the hands of the employee and the employer is subject to
withholding tax obligations on the same.

Unfortunately, when stock is issued under an ESOP scheme in start-ups,
there is no certainty on how much value / benefit may be realized when
the employee actually is able to sell the stock, or whether the employee
will at all be able to sell it, given in most cases these are unlisted
stocks!

Thus, taxation of stock issued under an ESOP scheme is purely on a
notional basis, and in cases the taxable amount may be way higher than
the salary payable to the employees! Currently, employers either (a)
withhold from the monetary payments made to the employees (b) ask the
employees to furnish a cheque for the required amount or in worst case
scenario (c) bear the tax cost themselves.

The association stated that ESOPs are an efficient way to remunerate and
incentivize employees to join start-ups and share the risk with the
founders. Keeping this in mind the high risk scenario in which both
founders and employees work in a start-up, the withholding tax should be
done away with and shares should only be taxed on realisation.

Multiple registration and filing under GST:

Like all service sectors, the digital sector too is plagued by the
challenge of state-wise multiple registrations and filing burdens. What
makes matters worse for the digital sector is the fact that most Indian
companies are start-ups who simply do not have the bandwidth to
undertake such exercises.

IAMAI urges the authorities to take note of this factor and allow single
registration for digital services, as has supposedly been proposed for
banking and financial services.

Anomaly in GST Rates:

Internet services digitalize conventional services. For example,
Edu-tech provides education via digital platform; health-tech allows
online doctor consultancy and ordering medicines, etc. However, under
GST, while education and health are tax free, all digital services are
taxed at 18%. Even telecom services like internet access are taxed at 18
percent, which is higher than the tax one pays for a meal in a
restaurant.

IAMAI urges GST rates to be lowered/rationalized for digital services to
be at par with offline counterparts for such services to be more
affordable. This will help such services be more popular in the rural
areas.

TCS and unlevel playing field for e-commerce:

The onerous burden of TCS imposed on online marketplaces is a step
brotherly treatment of one of the most popular and fast developing
digital service. TCS forces marketplaces to pay taxes on behalf of
sellers, a responsibility that their offline counterparts do not have to
bear. The fact that e-commerce facilitates inter-state transaction mean
that these platforms have to bear the additional burden of multiple
registration and filing on behalf of the sellers as well!

The additional problem with TCS is that small scale seller whose annual
revenues are lower than the taxable threshold too will have to register
under GSTN and will have 1% of their revenues deducted as tax for every
transaction conducted online. This alone is a big disincentive for
small-scale sellers to conduct businesses online. This runs contrary to
the vision of USD1 Tn Digital economy that envisages e-commerce to reach
market size of $150 Billion by 2024.

IAMAI urges the authorities to rectify this provision and provide online
marketplaces fair and equal grounds for conducting businesses in India.

Organic Acids Market Expected to Reach $29,197 Million, Globally, by
2023PORTLAND, OREGON, UNITED STATES, May 15, 2023 /einpresswire.com / --
rganic Acids Market Report, published by Allied Market Research,
projects that the global market was valued $16,837 million in 2016, and
is projected to reach $29,197 million by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 8.3%
from 2017 to 2023. The acetic acid segment held approximately one-third
of the total market share in 2016.

Access Full Summary at:

Organic acids are compounds that possess a carbon atom in its structure
and have a molecular formula RCOOH. Citric acid, acetic acid, lactic
acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, propionic acid, and
fumaric acid are some of the organic acids used widely in end-use
applications such as during formation of drugs, textiles, and adhesives.
These acids are produced commercially either by chemical synthesis or
from agro-industrial residues. However, fermentation processes are the
most commonly used methods. Furthermore, organic acids of tricarboxylic
acid cycle can be produced in high yields in microbiological processes.

Presently, the global organic acids market witnesses numerous
opportunities, owing to rapid increase in development of food & beverage
industry in Asia-Pacific and LAMEA. The decline in oil prices and
failure of start-up bio-fuel process have stimulated the production of
multiple organic acids from biomass as coproducts. This drives the
market growth as biomass acts as a renewable source for organic acids
production, thereby leveraging the cost of fuels for the production of
organic acids. Moreover, increase in demand for bio-based organic acids
has led to a surge in investment for R&D activities in the market.

Acetic acid accounted for almost two-third share, in terms of volume, in
2016, owing to increase in demand for acetic acids for preservation of
food items. In addition, acetic acids are being increasingly employed in
meat and poultry production in the form of sodium lactate to extend
shelf life, control pathogenic bacteria in food, improve water binding
capacity, and reduce sodium content.

Key Findings of the Organic Acids Market Study:

. In terms of value, the succinic acid segment is anticipated to show
the highest growth rate of 29% during the analysis period.

. Asia-Pacific is projected to maintain its lead throughout 2023,
growing at a CAGR of 7.1%, in terms of value.

. Agro & industrial waste segment occupied approximately one-fifth of
the total market in 2016.

. Germany occupied nearly one-fourth of the total Europe organic acids
market in 2016.

. In terms of value, China is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% from
2017 to 2023.

In 2016, Asia-Pacific accounted for nearly half of the total organic
acids market, and is expected to continue this trend, due to increase in
demand for organic acids in the manufacture of drugs and oil & gas
industries for corrosion resistance, specifically in China, India,
Japan, Brazil, and other developing countries.

The major companies profiled in the report include BASF SE, Cargill,
Inc., The Dow Chemical Company, Eastman Chemical Company, Myriant
Corporation, Calanese Corporation, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Henan
Jindan Lactic Acid Technology Co. Ltd., Tate & Lyle Plc., and E. I. Du
Pont De Nemours and Company.

Impact Of GST On Startups

Business World

July 7, 2018

Copyright 2018 Business World, distributed by Contify.com All Rights
Reserved

Length: 868 words

Byline: Vishal Raheja

Body

A decade ago, we may not be aware of the word 'Startup' but now it has
become one of the most searched keywords on search engines. Startups are
usually small and initially financed or operated by a handful of
founders. These companies offer a product or service that is not
currently being offered elsewhere in the market, or that the founders
believe is being offered in an inferior or unorganized manner. To
nurture the start-up entities, many new start-ups have also emerged to
incubate them. The incubators are must support the start-ups in their
initial phase. Though a start-up may take years to generate the profit,
they start generating the revenue in initial years. Start-ups may defer
the payment of income-tax but they are liable to pay GST from the moment
they cross the threshold limit (Rs 20 lakh or Rs 10 lakh as the case may
be).

On July 1, 2017, India witnessed its one of the biggest tax reforms
since independence, Goods and Services Tax. The GST subsumed almost all
the indirect taxes levied by the state government and the central
government, i.e., VAT, Service-tax, Excise Duty, Octroi, etc. A very few
exemptions have been given to the Industries from the levy of GST.
Rather than specifying the goods or services which are subject to GST,
the Govt. has issued a negative list of goods or services which are
exempt from tax. Thus, it has impacted almost all Industries, including
start-ups.

It is believed that India stands third as the Top Global Tech Innovation
Leader and contribution of start-ups in such tech innovation has played
a vital role. It is expected that the numbers of new start-ups shall
increase in the coming years due to the benefits they could get from
GST.

With the rollout of GST, the startups are now able to save their time,
efforts and money which was earlier wasted in compliance with multiple
state and central levies. In the new regime, they have to comply with
just a single levy i.e. GST. Efforts and money saved from compliance can
be channelized by the start-ups in innovation in their core areas which
will benefit them and nation.

The success ratio for new startups is less than 1%. The reasons for such
failure could be attributed to various internal and external factors,
inter-alia, shortage of funds for routine compliances and
inaccessibility to tax professionals, etc. With GST rollout, the
startups find it much easier to comply due to the compliance friendly
system which includes Composition Scheme, facility of online payment,
simple forms across India etc. GST, therefore, helps startups to focus
on managing and expanding operations rather than on the tedious process
of tax compliance.

The GST has drastically reduced the delivery time of goods due to the
removal of state barriers and similar rules in all the states for the
movement of goods. The introduction of the e-way bill is expected to act
as a catalyst for the even smoother movement of goods between states.
This reduction of delivery time and the logistics cost will have a
far-reaching impact on the startups which involves delivery of goods.

Anything, which brings a change along with the benefits, brings a lot of
other difficulties and problems which affected them adversely. Earlier,
manufacturing units having a turnover of less than 1.5 crore did not
have to pay any duty or get registration under excise. Now, under GST
this threshold is drastically reduced to as low as 20 lakhs. This has
brought many small start-ups under the tax net, thereby impacting their
bottom-line. The startups that are into e-commerce are required to get
registration even if their turnover is less than Rs 20 lakh, which is
creating a need of more compliance startups.

With the GSTroll out, it has become mandatory to upload invoices and
make an e-way bill on a real-time basis which has overburdened the
startups to focus on the tax compliance regularly which ultimately
affects their innovational capability. These compliances also mandate
the requirement of extra manpower which ultimately leads to leakage of
money from already financially poor startups.

On a conclusive note, we can conclude that the GST has far-reaching
impacts on the startups and the benefits certainly outweigh the negative
impacts it has caused to the startups. Further, it is recommended that
the Government should take more steps with the introduction of various
special measure or exemptions for the innovative startups and the young
entrepreneurs doing their business on an e-commerce platform. A
relaxation in GST rate can also be provided for start-ups like
area-based exemptions existed in Excise to boost innovation in the
country. The government can also make simpler rules for audit, accounts,
tax deposition and return filing of the startups to boost the startup
ecosystem and reduce the failure rate of the startups.

Which airlines launched, failed or merged in 2021?

Body

One of the most counter-intuitive things about the pandemic for the
airline sector has been that during the worst crisis the industry has
ever faced, relatively few carriers have collapsed.

The safety blankets governments wrapped around their national carriers,
together with the focus airlines have had on securing liquidity, have
largely ensured operators have been able to survive the crisis. Where
such support was not available, airlines have embarked on formal
restructurings to gain the necessary breathing space.

Source: ShutterstockAlitalia, which ceased operations in October after
many years of financial struggles, was the biggest airline to fail in
2021

Yet such has been the levels of network cuts and restructuring during
the crisis, that the door has been left open for new entrants. While the
pandemic has lowered some of the barriers to entry, namely accessing
markets and resources, in most instances the new players were already
projects in development, or emerged as direct replacements for failed
operators.

Alitalia finishes Italian job

The biggest airline failure and start-up during 2021 is one such
example. In October Alitalia finally took its final drink in the
last-chance saloon, to be replaced by ITA Airways.

Alitalia had spent much of the last decade struggling for sustainability
since it last needed restructuring. Having relaunched in 2009 as a
privately-owned carrier merged with Air One and with Air France-KLM as a
strategic investor, it later ran aground when Etihad called time on its
attempt to revamp the Italian carrier.

Source: ITA AirwaysIn December ITA Airways debuted its new livery on an
ex-Alitalia Airbus A320

The airline’s challenges were underscored by it spending its last four
years in administration, failing to secure new investment even before
the pandemic rocked the airline sector.

Alitalia ceased flights on 15 October and was immediately replaced by
ITA Airways. The latter marked a new slimmed down national carrier,
complete with ambitions to reach breakeven by the third quarter of 2023
and to completely revamp its fleet with new Airbus aircraft. It had by
the end of October joined SkyTeam, the global alliance Alitalia had been
in for the last 20 years.

Crucially, European regulators ruled that Italy had demonstrated “a
clear break” between Alitalia and ITA, and was also acting as a private
investor in providing €1.35 billion ($1.53 billion) in capital
injections over the next three years. It did though attach a number of
conditions restricting the scope of ITA’s activities.

While ITA secured breathing space from European regulators, low-cost
carriers – which did so much to keep the pressure on Alitalia over the
last two decades – have further stepped up their presence in Italian
markets during the pandemic.

Alitalia’s suspension of flights came after 70 years of operations. The
brand itself could yet reappear, after ITA acquired the Alitalia name in
October from administrators. At present that appears to be more of a
defensive move to prevent others utilising the brand, rather than part
of a plan to revive the Alitalia branding itself.

Replacing failed carriers

Likewise, the focus for many other new launches in Europe has been
seeking to fill a gap left by a fallen operator. That is evident in
Ireland, where Aer Lingus franchise carrier Stobart Air was forced to
pull the plug on operations in June after the collapse of a proposed
acquisition of the airline.

Stobart Group had been seeking a buyer for the regional carrier after it
had itself last year bought the operator back from Connect Airways
administrators as a means of managing outstanding financial commitments.

However, it subsequently faced a further blow when Aer Lingus, for whom
it had been operating flights as Aer Lingus Regional under a long-term
franchise, awarded a new 10-year deal starting from 2023 to Irish
start-up Emerald Airlines.

The latter carrier is run by Dublin Aerospace executive chairman Conor
McCarthy, the former Ryanair executive who was a co-founder of AirAsia,
and who began his career as chief executive of Aer Lingus Commuter.
Emerald, which will operate ATR turboprops, has now agreed to bring
forward the launch of operations by nearly 10 months to March 2022.

Airlines

Air Montenegro, which launched scheduled flights in June, was a
successor carrier to replace Montenegro Airlines. The latter had been
forced to suspend operations on 26 December last year after the
government ruled out further support for the debt-ridden airline.

The launch in June of Icelandic airline Play also had its origins in
replacing a previous operator. The airline is following the playbook
– the early chapters at least – of Wow Air. The Icelandic carrier had
developed a niche linking low-cost services from Reykjavik to European
and US east coast destinations.

Play employs a similar initial network and fleet as Wow, and features a
number of former executives from the airline. Chief executive Birgir

What casualties there have been in the US market have largely been among
regional airlines. One such operator, ExpressJet Airlines, which ceased
operations last year, resumed flying in October, operating
leisure-focused routes in the western USA under the brand Aha.

Moves are also underway to revive operations of two of the biggest
airline casualties of recent years: Flybe and Jet Airways.

While the pandemic proved the final straw for Flybe, the UK regional
carrier was already on the brink of failure. Plans for a resurrected
operation moved closer in November when the successor carrier took its
delivery of its first aircraft. The De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400
twin-turboprop, leased from Nordic Aviation Capital, was in service with
the previous iteration of Flybe from 2007 until the carrier ceased
operations in early 2020. 

Flybe plans to launch flights early in 2022 from Birmingham.

Indian carrier Jet Airways was the biggest airline collapse of 2019.
Since suspending operations in the spring of that year, there has been
constant talk of restoring operations. That moved closer to fruition
when a resolution plan from the Jalan-Kalrock consortium received court
approval in June. The airline has indicated plans to restart operations
in the first quarter of 2022 and has also said it is in talks with
Airbus and Boeing about a major aircraft order.

Moves are also reportedly also under way for Mexican low-cost operator
Interjet to return to the skies next year. The airline suspended flights
in late 2020.

Even within an airline group, start-up moves are sometimes driven by
replacing lost capacity. In the UK, for example, British Airways’ plans
for a new lower-cost subsidiary to be called BA Euroflyer, which it aims
to launch in the summer of 2022, are a means of finding a more
sustainable way of restoring short-haul flights from London Gatwick.

Neeleman start-up takes fresh breath

Probably the highest profile launch during the year was David Neeleman’s
Breeze Airways. Plans for the US start-up first emerged in the summer of
2018, including an order at that year’s Farnborough air show for Airbus
A220s. Despite the obvious challenges presented by the pandemic,
Neeleman launched Breeze – his fifth airline – in late May.

champagne ahead of Breeze Airways’ inaugural flight from Tampa to
Charleston, South Carolina, on 27 May 2021.

Breeze launched using Embraer 190 and 195 regional jets, but added its
first A220 – leased from AerCap – in December.

Speaking in London at the World Aviation Festival in early December,
Neeleman struck a positive tone – even with the impact of the Delta
variant on demand in late summer.

”Our business started late for the summer because the whole
certification process took a little longer than we hoped because of
Covid. Then we started selling, which was two weeks’ notice. So the
summer was pretty good for our first summer ever, but we launched a lot
of cities – 16 cities, 39 routes and 13 airplanes. But our RASM and
revenue was higher in October than July, so we are doing well,” he said.

”One of the things I learnt at Azul is that it’s sure much better to be
the only flight on a route, and that’s what we are on 98% of our routes.
You can stimulate new traffic and build new travel patterns,” he says.

A month earlier another US start-up, Avelo Airlines, had launched
operations. The ultra-low-cost carrier, founded by former Allegiant Air
and United Airlines executive Andrew Levy, is based at Los Angeles-area
Burbank Hollywood airport. Cirium fleets data shows it now has six
Boeing 737-800s in service.

Other North American carriers are lined up for next year. These include
AirBahn, which aims to launch flights from Los Angeles suburb Irvine,
and which at the end of November disclosed details of its first A320.

Northern Pacific Airways, headquartered in Anchorage, Alaska, plans to
introduce transpacific flights modelled after Icelandair’s transatlantic
operations: low-cost fares with the option of stopovers. Northern
Pacific has acquired its first 757 for the missions, and is looking to
launch in the third quarter of 2022.

Over the border, Canadian start-ups Lynx Air and Jetlines are both
targeting launches in the first quarter. Lynx Air is a rebranding of
Calgary-based charter operator Enerjet, which aims to begin
ultra-low-cost services, initially using three Boeing 737 Max jets. 

Meanwhile Jetlines, which has promised to launch a low-cost airline for
years, has set its sights on beginning flights by the second quarter of
2022. The Vancouver-based company, which has gone through numerous top
management changes since coming onto the scene in 2015, in December said
it has identified its first aircraft, a used Airbus A320.

Canadian carrier Sky Regional Airlines though became another North
American regional carrier casualty during the crisis, as it ceased
operations in March. That followed Air Canada’s move to consolidtate its
Air Canada Express flights under one operator, transferring 25 Embraer
175s from Sky Regional to Jazz Aviation.

In Latin America, Mexican carrier Volaris in September launched an El
Salvador operation. However, two new airline start-ups planned in
Ecuador have been pushed into 2022.

Equair, which was aiming to launch flights on 22 December, had its
launch pushed back to 10 January, while a move to restart Ecuatoriana –
almost a decade after the collapse of the carrier – is now planned for
2022.

In the Dominican Republic, AraJet, formerly Flycana, plans to introduce
operations in early 2022 as well. 

New entrants outweigh failures

Across regions plans for start-up carriers outpaced the airlines leaving
the market. 

In Europe, Air Antwerp and Great Dane Airlines were among carriers
forced to call time on operations during 2021. But opportunities in
Norway, resulting from cutbacks at restructuring Norwegian, has prompted
two new entrant projects in the country.

First to reach market was Flyr, which launched operations in June,
initially on domestic routes. It has since begun short-haul flights
within Europe. Cirium fleets data shows it operates five Boeing
737-800s, while it has also agreed to lease 737 Max 8s from Air Lease
next year.

Low-cost long-haul start-up Norse Atlantic Airways took delivery of its
first aircraft in December, as it prepares to launch transatlantic
flights in spring 2022. It aims to fill a gap left by Norwegian after it
ceased its long-haul operation across the Atlantic. Norse Atlantic plans
to operate a fleet of a dozen 787-9s and three 787-8s by summer 2022.

Elsewhere in Europe, Italian start-up Ego Airways launched operations in
April using a leased Embraer 190. However there is uncertainty over
another Italian carrier, Blue Panorama Airlines, after it suspended
operations and filed for bankruptcy protection in late October. 

In Asia-Pacific, new start-ups include Korean pair Aero K and Air
Premia. Low-cost carrier Aero K launched scheduled domestic flights in
April, becoming the country’s eighth low-cost carrier. Air Premia
secured its AOC in July ahead of launching operations using Boeing 787
Dreamliners in August.

Super Air Jet, a new Indonesian carrier with links to Lion Group founder
Rusdi Kirana, launched flights in the summer. The carrier began flying
from Jakarta to Medan and Batam in August, operating a daily service
with Airbus A320s. 

Hong Kong start-up Greater Bay Airlines secured its AOC in October, but
is still to firm a launch date. The airline is headed by Algernon Yau –
formerly head of Cathay Dragon, the leisure unit shuttered by the Hong
Kong carrier when the pandemic hit – and is backed by Donghai Airlines
owner Bill Wong Cho-bau.

Ambitious Indian start-up also progressed moves to enter the market
when Akasa Air signed an order for 72 Boeing 737 Max aircraft at
November’s Dubai air show. Akasa, which is led by Vinay Dube, is a brand
of SNV Aviation and has been targeting a launch in summer 2022. The
airline in December debuted its branding.

Also on the horizon for next year is a new Australian low-cost carrier
named Bonza, which aims to begin services with Boeing 737 Max aircraft
in early 2022. Bonza is backed by Miami private equity firm 777
Partners. Pending regulatory approval, Bonza expects to launch in early
2022.

Japanese start-up, Toki Air, emerged in November when ATR during the
Dubai air show disclosed it had signed a letter of intent for two of its
in-development ATR 42-600 short take-off and landing (STOL) versions.
That aircraft is not due for first flight until 2023, but Toki is to
lease two ATR 72-600s to enable it to launch services in 2022.

One airline name in the region that disappeared during 2021 was
Singapore Airline’s brand Silk Air. The latter’s operations were folded
into the SIA in January, including the Boeing 737 Max originally
destined for Silk Air.

Nigerian operator Green Africa Airways launched flights in August using
ATR-72 turbopops, while in December Zambia Airways began domestic
flights linking the capital Lusaka to the city of Ndola. The latter
carrier has been set up in partnership with Ethiopian Airlines, which
has a 45% share in the venture.

flights using ATR turboprops

However Air Namibia was an African operator which ceased flights during
the year. The carrier, which suspended flights in February, was formally
liquidated in late March.

In the Middle East, central European budget carrier Wizz Air at the
start of 2021 launched its Abu Dhabi joint venture carrier. Cirium
schedules data shows it operating to 17 destinations from Abu Dhabi. It
comes after last year’s launch of Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, a joint venture
between Etihad and Air Arabia.

The latter is also working on a further joint venture carrier in
Armenia. In September the partners identified the carrier would be
called Fly Arna, though launch details are still be confirmed.

Mergers struggle to get over the line

Airline appetite – or indeed resources - for mergers and acquisitions
remained limited in 2021.

Moves already in play before the pandemic became convoluted and have
either been dropped, parked or remain on the back burner.

European regulators ultimately put the kybosh on Air Canada’s proposed
acquisition of leisure operator Transat.

Source: Liner/Shutterstock.comAIr Transat resumed flights following the
pandemic in July

The Star Alliance carrier’s acquisition of its Canadian rival was first
agreed in the summer of 2019, but competition concerns in Canada and
Europe held up approval of the deal.

Fresh terms, under which Air Canada would acquire Transat at a
discounted price, were reached in December 2020. While Canadian
regulators finally cleared the deal in February, the carriers in April
abandoned the acquisition after conceding they were unlikely to secure
competition clearance from the European authorities.

Transat subsequently opted to go it alone, after takeover talks with
billionaire investor Pierre Karl Peladeau failed.

Canadian carriers had struggled amid particularly tight border
restrictions and, until funding was agreed in April, a lack of state
support. Transat ultimately resumed flights in late July.

“Honestly, we wish the government had shown more concern for the
industry from the beginning of the crisis, like we saw early on in
Europe and the USA,” new Air Transat chief executive Annick Guerard told
FlightGlobal in September. “But we are grateful for the financial
support that we got in the spring. It gave us the breathing space we
needed to move forward.”

Another on-off deal agreed before the pandemic, IAG’s acquisition of Air
Europa, remains in limbo. It does though at least appear to be reaching
the end game, after an end-of-January deadline was agreed to come up
with a new structure to revive the deal.

Iberia parent IAG first agreed to acquire Air Europa from Globalia in
late 2019 as part of moves to strengthen its Madrid hub, and to help
fill a gap left by the loss of its long-term partner LATAM Airlines
Group from Oneworld.

Terms were renegotiated after the pandemic hit, lowering the price of
Air Europa and pushing back payment. However, IAG has grown less
optimistic about completing the deal, which among others things involved
agreeing conditions to meet competition concerns, and in December the
purchase agreement was terminated. European regulators subsequently said
IAG’s proposed remedies were “not able to adequately address the
competition concerns identified”.

The deal though could yet happen if IAG and Globalia can agree a new
structure by the end of January. “We have committed to analyse
alternative arrangements with Globalia that could deliver significant
benefits,” says IAG chief executive Luis Gallego.

Another proposed acquisition involving a Spanish operator, Air Nostrum,
was also put on hold by the crisis. The regional carrier was exploring a
tie-up with Irish wet-lease specialist CityJet prior the pandemic.

But the focus shifted as the crisis struck. Notably, CityJet underwent a
formal restructuring, which it completed in August 2020. 

However, comments from Air Nostrum’s chief financial officer Jose Manuel
Gamir, reported by Spanish news site El Economista in December,
indicated the deal was still alive.

This is echoed by CityJet. “We paused discussions during the pandemic as
both airlines faced challenges which took priority over the
co-operation, with the intention of picking up again at an appropriate
time,” says a company spokesman. “This is still the case but we
obviously have remained in regular contact with Air Nostrum and will
re-engage on discussions in due course.”

One merger does remain on course. Korean Air agreed to acquire rival
carrier Asiana Airlines last year. It has since been ticking off various
regulatory approvals in the region,

”We expect the approval process to be completed by the end of this
year,” Korean Air chief executive Walter Cho told FlightGlobal in
August. ”After the approval, Asiana will become a subsidiary of Korean
Air. Both airlines will work closely to integrate all the operational
areas – including processes and systems – to create synergy.”

Cho points out that the two airlines have been competitors for 30 years,
and have developed “very different cultures”. He says: “It’s critical to
merge the two cultures based on understanding and harmony. We’ll make
this happen during the two years from when Asiana becomes a subsidiary
of Korean Air.”

Acquisition moves ahead

Arguably the most intriguing deals mooted in 2021 were opportunistic
moves which have yet to get beyond first interest. In September, UK
low-cost carrier EasyJet revealed it had rejected a preliminary takeover
offer from an undisclosed party.  EasyJet added it was not further
considering the offer, which it said undervalued the company.

approach in September

While neither party confirmed the identity of the bidder, it was widely
reported to have come from fast-expanding European low-cost rival Wizz
Air. A deal would have raised plenty of questions, not least around
bringing together carriers at opposite ends of the low-cost carrier
spectrum.

But it did serve as a reminder of the extent to which low-cost carriers
in Europe have used acquisitions as a way of expansion, albeit they have
usually focused on smaller and often failing operators.

In Brazil, David Neeleman’s Azul also put its hand up for LATAM Airlines
Group, pending the outcome of the latter’s financial restructuring. “The
macroeconomic situation promotes consolidation in this space,” Azul’
chief executive John Rodgerson said in a November earnings call. 

Azul subsequently stepped away, at least for now, citing the high
valuation of LATAM. The latter has now filed its restructuring plan
aimed at exiting Chapter 11.

One deal set for completion early next year, and which will have a
consolidation impact, is Tata Son’s acquisition of Air India. The deal
will bring to an end India’s drawn-out efforts to divest its debt-laden
national carrier. Tata emerged as the winning bidder for Air India in
October.

Air India will add to Tata’s existing airline portfolio. It also owns
51% in Indian carrier Vistara, a joint venture in which Singapore
Airlines owns the other 49%, and 84% of AirAsia India.

Though Tata has not disclosed its plans, analysts have long believed
that its ultimate intention will be to merge the full-service brands of
Air India and Vistara, while also merging the low-cost brands of Air
India Express and AirAsia India. This would create a powerful
full-service airline with a strong international network, as well as a
low-cost unit to tackle India’s tough domestic market.

Body

One of the most counter-intuitive things about the pandemic for the
airline sector has been that during the worst crisis the industry has
ever faced, relatively few carriers have collapsed.

The safety blankets governments wrapped around their national carriers,
together with the focus airlines have had on securing liquidity, have
largely ensured operators have been able to survive the crisis. Where
such support was not available, airlines have embarked on formal
restructurings to gain the necessary breathing space.

many years of financial struggles, was the biggest airline to fail in
2021

Yet such has been the levels of network cuts and restructuring during
the crisis, that the door has been left open for new entrants. While the
pandemic has lowered some of the barriers to entry, namely accessing
markets and resources, in most instances the new players were already
projects in development, or emerged as direct replacements for failed
operators.

Alitalia finishes Italian job

The biggest airline failure and start-up during 2021 is one such
example. In October Alitalia finally took its final drink in the
last-chance saloon, to be replaced by ITA Airways.

Alitalia had spent much of the last decade struggling for sustainability
since it last needed restructuring. Having relaunched in 2009 as a
privately-owned carrier merged with Air One and with Air France-KLM as a
strategic investor, it later ran aground when Etihad called time on its
attempt to revamp the Italian carrier.

Source: ITA AirwaysIn December ITA Airways debuted its new livery on an
ex-Alitalia Airbus A320

The airline’s challenges were underscored by it spending its last four
years in administration, failing to secure new investment even before
the pandemic rocked the airline sector.

Alitalia ceased flights on 15 October and was immediately replaced by
ITA Airways. The latter marked a new slimmed down national carrier,
complete with ambitions to reach breakeven by the third quarter of 2023
and to completely revamp its fleet with new Airbus aircraft. It had by
the end of October joined SkyTeam, the global alliance Alitalia had been
in for the last 20 years.

Crucially, European regulators ruled that Italy had demonstrated “a
clear break” between Alitalia and ITA, and was also acting as a private
investor in providing €1.35 billion ($1.53 billion) in capital
injections over the next three years. It did though attach a number of
conditions restricting the scope of ITA’s activities.

While ITA secured breathing space from European regulators, low-cost
carriers – which did so much to keep the pressure on Alitalia over the
last two decades – have further stepped up their presence in Italian
markets during the pandemic.

Alitalia’s suspension of flights came after 70 years of operations. The
brand itself could yet reappear, after ITA acquired the Alitalia name in
October from administrators. At present that appears to be more of a
defensive move to prevent others utilising the brand, rather than part
of a plan to revive the Alitalia branding itself.

Replacing failed carriers

Likewise, the focus for many other new launches in Europe has been
seeking to fill a gap left by a fallen operator. That is evident in
Ireland, where Aer Lingus franchise carrier Stobart Air was forced to
pull the plug on operations in June after the collapse of a proposed
acquisition of the airline.

Stobart Group had been seeking a buyer for the regional carrier after it
had itself last year bought the operator back from Connect Airways
administrators as a means of managing outstanding financial commitments.

However, it subsequently faced a further blow when Aer Lingus, for whom
it had been operating flights as Aer Lingus Regional under a long-term
franchise, awarded a new 10-year deal starting from 2023 to Irish
start-up Emerald Airlines.

The latter carrier is run by Dublin Aerospace executive chairman Conor
McCarthy, the former Ryanair executive who was a co-founder of AirAsia,
and who began his career as chief executive of Aer Lingus Commuter.
Emerald, which will operate ATR turboprops, has now agreed to bring
forward the launch of operations by nearly 10 months to March 2022.

Airlines

Air Montenegro, which launched scheduled flights in June, was a
successor carrier to replace Montenegro Airlines. The latter had been
forced to suspend operations on 26 December last year after the
government ruled out further support for the debt-ridden airline.

The launch in June of Icelandic airline Play also had its origins in
replacing a previous operator. The airline is following the playbook
– the early chapters at least – of Wow Air. The Icelandic carrier had
developed a niche linking low-cost services from Reykjavik to European
and US east coast destinations.

Play employs a similar initial network and fleet as Wow, and features a
number of former executives from the airline. Chief executive Birgir
Jonsson, who had a year at Wow but was a relatively latecomer to the
project, points to the success of the Wow model before it over-expanded
its fleet and network. 

Since launching on European routes in the summer, Play has now detailed
plans to begin transatlantic flights next spring, serving Baltimore and
Boston.

What casualties there have been in the US market have largely been among
regional airlines. One such operator, ExpressJet Airlines, which ceased
operations last year, resumed flying in October, operating
leisure-focused routes in the western USA under the brand Aha.

Moves are also underway to revive operations of two of the biggest
airline casualties of recent years: Flybe and Jet Airways.

While the pandemic proved the final straw for Flybe, the UK regional
carrier was already on the brink of failure. Plans for a resurrected
operation moved closer in November when the successor carrier took its
delivery of its first aircraft. The De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400
twin-turboprop, leased from Nordic Aviation Capital, was in service with
the previous iteration of Flybe from 2007 until the carrier ceased
operations in early 2020. 

Flybe plans to launch flights early in 2022 from Birmingham.

Indian carrier Jet Airways was the biggest airline collapse of 2019.
Since suspending operations in the spring of that year, there has been
constant talk of restoring operations. That moved closer to fruition
when a resolution plan from the Jalan-Kalrock consortium received court
approval in June. The airline has indicated plans to restart operations
in the first quarter of 2022 and has also said it is in talks with
Airbus and Boeing about a major aircraft order.

in early 2022. Bonza is backed by Miami private equity firm 777
Partners. Pending regulatory approval, Bonza expects to launch in early
2022.

Japanese start-up, Toki Air, emerged in November when ATR during the
Dubai air show disclosed it had signed a letter of intent for two of its
in-development ATR 42-600 short take-off and landing (STOL) versions.
That aircraft is not due for first flight until 2023, but Toki is to
lease two ATR 72-600s to enable it to launch services in 2022.

One airline name in the region that disappeared during 2021 was
Singapore Airline’s brand Silk Air. The latter’s operations were folded
into the SIA in January, including the Boeing 737 Max originally
destined for Silk Air.

Nigerian operator Green Africa Airways launched flights in August using
ATR-72 turbopops, while in December Zambia Airways began domestic
flights linking the capital Lusaka to the city of Ndola. The latter
carrier has been set up in partnership with Ethiopian Airlines, which
has a 45% share in the venture.

flights using ATR turboprops

However Air Namibia was an African operator which ceased flights during
the year. The carrier, which suspended flights in February, was formally
liquidated in late March.

In the Middle East, central European budget carrier Wizz Air at the
start of 2021 launched its Abu Dhabi joint venture carrier. Cirium
schedules data shows it operating to 17 destinations from Abu Dhabi. It
comes after last year’s launch of Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, a joint venture
between Etihad and Air Arabia.

The latter is also working on a further joint venture carrier in
Armenia. In September the partners identified the carrier would be
called Fly Arna, though launch details are still be confirmed.

Mergers struggle to get over the line

Airline appetite – or indeed resources - for mergers and acquisitions
remained limited in 2021.

Moves already in play before the pandemic became convoluted and have
either been dropped, parked or remain on the back burner.

European regulators ultimately put the kybosh on Air Canada’s proposed
acquisition of leisure operator Transat.

pandemic in July

The Star Alliance carrier’s acquisition of its Canadian rival was first
agreed in the summer of 2019, but competition concerns in Canada and
Europe held up approval of the deal.

Fresh terms, under which Air Canada would acquire Transat at a
discounted price, were reached in December 2020. While Canadian
regulators finally cleared the deal in February, the carriers in April
abandoned the acquisition after conceding they were unlikely to secure
competition clearance from the European authorities.

Transat subsequently opted to go it alone, after takeover talks with
billionaire investor Pierre Karl Peladeau failed.

Canadian carriers had struggled amid particularly tight border
restrictions and, until funding was agreed in April, a lack of state
support. Transat ultimately resumed flights in late July.

“Honestly, we wish the government had shown more concern for the
industry from the beginning of the crisis, like we saw early on in
Europe and the USA,” new Air Transat chief executive Annick Guerard told
FlightGlobal in September. “But we are grateful for the financial
support that we got in the spring. It gave us the breathing space we
needed to move forward.”

Another on-off deal agreed before the pandemic, IAG’s acquisition of Air
Europa, remains in limbo. It does though at least appear to be reaching
the end game, after an end-of-January deadline was agreed to come up
with a new structure to revive the deal.

Iberia parent IAG first agreed to acquire Air Europa from Globalia in
late 2019 as part of moves to strengthen its Madrid hub, and to help
fill a gap left by the loss of its long-term partner LATAM Airlines
Group from Oneworld.

Terms were renegotiated after the pandemic hit, lowering the price of
Air Europa and pushing back payment. However, IAG has grown less
optimistic about completing the deal, which among others things involved
agreeing conditions to meet competition concerns, and in December the
purchase agreement was terminated. European regulators subsequently said
IAG’s proposed remedies were “not able to adequately address the
competition concerns identified”.

The deal though could yet happen if IAG and Globalia can agree a new
structure by the end of January. “We have committed to analyse
alternative arrangements with Globalia that could deliver significant
benefits,” says IAG chief executive Luis Gallego.

Another proposed acquisition involving a Spanish operator, Air Nostrum,
was also put on hold by the crisis. The regional carrier was exploring a
tie-up with Irish wet-lease specialist CityJet prior the pandemic.

But the focus shifted as the crisis struck. Notably, CityJet underwent a
formal restructuring, which it completed in August 2020. 

However, comments from Air Nostrum’s chief financial officer Jose Manuel
Gamir, reported by Spanish news site El Economista in December,
indicated the deal was still alive.

This is echoed by CityJet. “We paused discussions during the pandemic as
both airlines faced challenges which took priority over the
co-operation, with the intention of picking up again at an appropriate
time,” says a company spokesman. “This is still the case but we
obviously have remained in regular contact with Air Nostrum and will
re-engage on discussions in due course.”

One merger does remain on course. Korean Air agreed to acquire rival
carrier Asiana Airlines last year. It has since been ticking off various
regulatory approvals in the region,

”We expect the approval process to be completed by the end of this
year,” Korean Air chief executive Walter Cho told FlightGlobal in
August. ”After the approval, Asiana will become a subsidiary of Korean
Air. Both airlines will work closely to integrate all the operational
areas – including processes and systems – to create synergy.”

Cho points out that the two airlines have been competitors for 30 years,
and have developed “very different cultures”. He says: “It’s critical to
merge the two cultures based on understanding and harmony. We’ll make
this happen during the two years from when Asiana becomes a subsidiary
of Korean Air.”

Acquisition moves ahead

Arguably the most intriguing deals mooted in 2021 were opportunistic
moves which have yet to get beyond first interest. In September, UK
low-cost carrier EasyJet revealed it had rejected a preliminary takeover
offer from an undisclosed party.  EasyJet added it was not further
considering the offer, which it said undervalued the company.

approach in September

While neither party confirmed the identity of the bidder, it was widely
reported to have come from fast-expanding European low-cost rival Wizz
Air. A deal would have raised plenty of questions, not least around
bringing together carriers at opposite ends of the low-cost carrier
spectrum.

But it did serve as a reminder of the extent to which low-cost carriers
in Europe have used acquisitions as a way of expansion, albeit they have
usually focused on smaller and often failing operators.

In Brazil, David Neeleman’s Azul also put its hand up for LATAM Airlines
Group, pending the outcome of the latter’s financial restructuring. “The
macroeconomic situation promotes consolidation in this space,” Azul’
chief executive John Rodgerson said in a November earnings call. 

Azul subsequently stepped away, at least for now, citing the high
valuation of LATAM. The latter has now filed its restructuring plan
aimed at exiting Chapter 11.

One deal set for completion early next year, and which will have a
consolidation impact, is Tata Son’s acquisition of Air India. The deal
will bring to an end India’s drawn-out efforts to divest its debt-laden
national carrier. Tata emerged as the winning bidder for Air India in
October.

Air India will add to Tata’s existing airline portfolio. It also owns
51% in Indian carrier Vistara, a joint venture in which Singapore
Airlines owns the other 49%, and 84% of AirAsia India.

Though Tata has not disclosed its plans, analysts have long believed
that its ultimate intention will be to merge the full-service brands of
Air India and Vistara, while also merging the low-cost brands of Air
India Express and AirAsia India. This would create a powerful
full-service airline with a strong international network, as well as a
low-cost unit to tackle India’s tough domestic market.

Longest semi-automated rotor spinning machine

Indian Textile Journal

January 18, 2018 Thursday

Copyright 2018 IPFOnline Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 1122 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, Jan. 18 -- The R 36 with the new S 36 spin box is a smart tool,
which enables users to reach excellent productivity in line with high
yarn quality from a wide range of raw materials. The new optional
function Automated Spinning-In (ASI) allows higher machine productivity
due to rapid spinning start-up after a machine stop.

The new semi-automated R 36 rotor spinning machine with 600 spinning
positions is already successfully running in the field. The R 36 is a
smart and economical solution for producing high quality yarns from Ne 2
to Ne 40 with state-of-the-art technology. With up to 600 spinning
positions and maximum 200 m/min delivery speed, it stands for better
yarn quality and higher productivity compared to its predecessor. The
improved AMIspin and the new AMIspin-Pro technology secure excellent
piecing quality. The optional AMIspin-Pro with new ASI function
simplifies piecing and allows a rapid start-up of the machine after a
power interruption by just pressing a button.

Highest productivity in its class

The longest 600 spinning unit semi-automated rotor machine provides
maximum productivity in combination with modern, very energy efficient
drives and frequency converters. Thanks to the latest spinning
technology with the S 36 spin box and the resulting perfect spinning
stability, a rotor speed of 1,20,000 rpm can easily be applied. The
delivery speed of 200 m/min for full machine length is supported by
electronically controlled yarn traverses.

In addition to innovations in spinning and piecing technology, latest
technology of motor manufacturers for energy saving was applied to
update the drive concept. Compared to older machine models, the more
energy efficient main drives reduce the energy consumption per kg of
yarn by up to 10 per cent.

Benefits for all applications

The R 36 achieves high productivity, lower energy consumption and good
quality with all rotor yarn applications. Customers additionally profit
from the following advantages:

Quality Spinning-In (QSI) allows a rapid start-up after power failure
with 100 per cent AMIspin piecing quality, and that with all
applications. The yarn ends to be pieced can be optimally prepared
during the machine downtime. This standard function offers additional
power saving during the machine start-up.

Even at maximum speed, perfect package quality during piecing is
guaranteed. To this end, the R 36 is equipped with an electronically
regulated loop compensator that takes up the surplus feed yarn at the
moment of piecing.

Machine operation is made easy by the graphic touch screen. Graphic
visualisation helps with setting the quality channels for the proven Q
10 quality sensor.

Thanks to improved spinning technology the new S 36 spin box is able to
handle an extraordinarily wide range of materials and yarn counts from
Ne 2 to Ne 40. The economic advantage of the semi-automated rotor
spinning technology is intensified by greater flexibility in terms of
raw material selection.

The S 36 spin box ensures optimised fibre flow to the newly designed
rotors. In doing so, sensitive fibre opening is retained which leads to
excellent raw material yield and brings benefits in yarn quality and
spinning stability. The gentle opening and the innovative fibre guidance
are the basis for fewer yarn imperfections, increased yarn strength and
perfect evenness.

The raw materials to be processed range from high quality raw fibres and
man-made fibres to blends from waste and regenerated fibres. The R 36 is
the most efficient answer to the current market requirements - spinning
of cotton, waste materials, viscose, polyester, and recycled fibres and
their blends. Special applications, like wool, linen and linen blends,
are also fully covered.

Easy piecing with AMIspin

AMIspin continues to ensure optimal piecing at consistently high
quality. The individual motor for sliver feed ensures that only
undamaged fibres are used for piecings. For feeding optimal fibre mass,
the controls profit from Rieter know-how of the fully automatic machine.
The operators have long since enjoyed the simplicity of the AMIspin
piecing process, thanks to which the spinning positions can continue to
create excellent yarn piecings in the shortest time possible.

Uniform piecing with AMIspin-Pro

As a new option, the R 36 is available with the AMIspin-Pro function
using a single delivery drive for the take-off. AMIspin-Pro adds a
further AMIspin advantage by means of more precise, intelligent
controlling of the piecing process. This provides more uniform piecing
strength. The manual handling of the yarn for piecing became even easier
with this option, increasing the success rate.

The new option AMIspin-Pro includes the new function ASI (Automated
Spinning-In). This allows a rapid machine restart after a power failure.
A simple push of a button is enough to get the machine up and running
again.

Renowned machine concept

In addition to the innovations mentioned, all the known outstanding
advantages of the Rieter concept for semi-automated rotor spinning
machines have been adopted by the R 36:

Low machine height and ergonomic accessibility for easy and time saving
machine operation.

Full flexibility with independent machine sides.

Yarn quality control using modern Q 10 sensor concept.

This secures the outstanding position of the R 36 with its well-known
sturdy machine concept for easiest and cost saving operation and
maintenance.

Initial reactions from the field

The first R 36 machines are already operating in various spinning mills.
The feedback given by these spinning mills in India, China and other
Asian countries, as well in Europe and America, is very positive: Yarns
from waste and recycled fibres achieve better yarn strength and fewer
imperfections with the R 36 when compared to other spinning machines.

The longest R 36 with 600 spinning units is in full production. The
customer, who also has experience with competitor machines, is going to
order more R 36. A customer manufacturing Ne 20 yarns from cotton waste
on the R 36 was able to save 10 per cent energy per kg of yarn compared
to its R 923 model.

Denim yarn produced on the R 36 for the local Indian market is used by
one weaver. He prefers this yarn from our customer to the yarns from
competitor rotor spinning machines. ASI makes it easier for the customer
to deal with frequent power failures. This customer has also placed
another order.

Jeff Bezos and Sir Richard Branson hit the headlines over the summer as
they vied to become the first tourists to take a suborbital leisure
ride. But there's more to the space race than a clash of billionaires
and their towering egos. Across the globe there are hundreds of
start-ups looking to tap into the commercial potential of outer space.

Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire, has pulled ahead of the pack with his
SpaceX venture. Founded in 2002, the company has built rockets capable
of shuttling satellites and other cargo into orbit and, crucially, has
worked out how to land and reuse the hardware after flight. It has
lucrative contracts with Nasa and the US military and was valued at a
reported $74 billion when it last raised capital in the spring. SpaceX
aims to become the workhorse of nascent space by drastically reducing
the cost of launching satellites into space. In the 1980s, satellite
operators would pay $85,000 a kilogram to get their kit into orbit.
Thanks to SpaceX they're now paying less than $1,000 a kg, according to
Mark Boggett, the managing director of London-listed Seraphim Space
Investment Trust. Satellites, too, have become much more affordable.
Nowadays they're smaller, lighter and cheaper to build, and the
investment needed to create a constellation of satellites covering all
corners of the earth is much lower than before. The data collected has
myriad commercial uses, from enabling driverless cars and delivery
drones to predicting the weather and combating climate change. But the
history of space start-ups is littered with failures. OneWeb, the
satellite broadband company, fell into administration in March last year
and was subsequently rescued by the UK taxpayer and the Indian
billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal.

Govt lines up series of workshops to resolve regulatory concerns faced
by innovator companies

To provide an in-depth understanding of the regulatory pathways and
drug-medical device approval process via its Sugam portal, the
Department of Biotechnology (DBT) along with the Central Drugs Standard
Control Organisation (CDSCO) has lined up a series of six national
workshops facilitating the resolution of regulatory concerns faced by
innovator companies in the country. BIRAC and CDSA too chipped in its
expertise.

The workshops are being organised by the government to spur its Make in
India programme in sectors of pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical
devices, in-vitro diagnostics, phytopharmaceuticals and vaccines as the
government is of the view that it is critical for innovator companies
and start-ups to interact with regulatory authorities directly to
clarify issues that hamper their growth and development.

At a day-long session at the national workshop held in the C-CAMP
(Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platform) campus in Bengaluru, around
100 participants had intensive deliberations to accelerate innovations
across companies and start-ups in the sector.

Going by India's capability in innovation which is set to transform drug
delivery, manufacture of biologicals and new medical device development,
Amaresh Tumbagi, drugs controller (in-charge), government of Karnataka
said that taking a research from discovery to development spanned 10
years of time and investments. Therefore, it is important for the
regulatory authorities both at the state and centre to guide and discuss
with innovator companies and start-ups to prevent a failure during a
regulatory submission.

"Selection of a drug target to lead optimisation takes anywhere from 1
to 5 years and we do see and hear of companies facing insurmountable
stumbling blocks. This is where consultations between companies and
regulators could offset much of the crisis", he added.

Karnataka drugs control department has put in place a rigorous drug
approval system. It has also 22 services coming under the 'Sakala' which
mandates timelines for services and penalises its officers for failing
to stick to the stipulated deadline. This augurs well for the growing
innovative companies in the state which is a hub for pharma, biotech and
medical device manufacture, said Tumbagi.

"Even if any product that is developed did not come under the ambit of
regulation, efforts would be made by our state drugs control department
to understand the novel technology process and discuss with the central
drugs & devices regulatory authority on its importance. We would also
work together with the CDSCO to introduce a clause in the existing
regulatory note to ensure that such an innovation comes under the
regulatory pathway for approval," said Tumbagi.

Providing a peek into the drug regulations in India along with an
overview of the CDSCO structure, approval process, checklist for
application submission via Sugam online portal and fee structure, Dr. B
Kumar, deputy Drugs Controller General of India, CDSCO, Sub-Zonal
office, Bengaluru said that the aim was to strengthen the regulations,
remain updated and move towards a PIC/S regime for India.

Dr. Taslimarif Saiyed, CEO and director, C-CAMP said that since its
campus houses several start-ups, it was a mediator airing concerns of
the innovators to the regulatory authorities. A decision to have a
portal with queries from the innovators to the regulator was on the
cards.

Decoding the failure of Indian startups - the scale problem

India has been a great success story, especially in IT, post the
liberalization of the economy. However, failure continues to plague a
large percentage of new startups and enterprises launched in Indian IT.
We can look at the Indian IT sector's evolution in comparison to the way
Indian cricket has also evolved. For example, the new T20 game format is
akin to a startup.

A predominantly services-based company trying to produce products and
build competencies is not a joke. The fundamental problem that needs to
be addressed here is education. Are we getting the right skill set of
people? The university-corporate relationship in India is an evolving
entity. It's like the Indian cricket team missing that one all-rounder
who can solve that critical balance problem.

If you can, as a startup, decode this, you have the technology in place.
However, technology alone will not solve the problem; you need to finish
the game and you need a Dhoni. When we get lost in the passion of
exploring technology, sometimes we forget we still have to do business,
and evolving the right business model is critical.

Indian cricket and Indian IT have evolved together, and for that matter,
so has the Indian economy. But Indian startups are struggling today, viz
they are not able to solve the scale problem. If you are going to
achieve scale, the question of "Is there a market for your technology?"
is something you need to address at the very beginning, and timing is
very critical.

Take the case of the IPL format of cricket. India wins the T20 World Cup
and BCCI starts the IPL. Similarly, with building scale in a startup
too, you need to start at the right time. Google, Apple, Amazon, and
Facebook are oft-quoted and admired US startups which succeeded. How
many do we have?

The me-too syndrome is admittedly a big problem. We try to emulate
US-based startups or are happy providing services rather than building
products. If you don't focus on providing hyperlocal solutions, building
scale in a market like India is going to be difficult.

A strange pattern that is emerging is that non-local founder companies
are succeeding in the same areas where their local counterparts are not
able to crack the market.

This is an interesting phenomenon and needs introspection. One could
even call this a mindset issue, like in Indian cricket, where the team
needed a foreign coach - be it, a John Wright or Gary Kristen - to solve
the problem.

Dattatri Salagame, Digital Head and Vice President at Bosch Engineering
and Business Solutions Pvt Ltd, says, "For a consumer, be it when he is
at his home or using mobility for leisure or work...where convenience is
needed - and when - is at a retail outlet, where 'needs' are important.
We are moving towards an 'Internet of Living'. Making 'choices at the
right time' is important, and this will enhance the quality of living
going forward."

As millennials of the post-liberalization and startup era, one hopes
that the next generation of entrepreneurs will be able to find solutions
to the problem of scale for Indian startups. When they do, we should
start seeing true success stories, and probably see the next Apple or
Google born in India.

Hemanth Sheelvant and Pavan Govindan are founders in an intrapreneurial
venture in Bosch called IERO.

It's time to change the way India does business

The Financial Express

By Sumita Kale

& Rishi Agarwal

In her Budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman put a greater spotlight on Ease
of Doing Business through many measures-simplifying GST process,
e-assessments for tax, interchangeable Aadhaar and PAN, etc. The
government's intent to further simplify procedures, reduce red-tape and
make the best use of technology was clearly set out. However, there was
no reference of a refreshing, revolutionary move that is already on the
cards. A draft Cabinet note has reportedly been circulated last month on
the National Ease of Doing Business Policy, where, for the first time,
we see the government holding the bureaucrats accountable for the
compliance requirements they place on businesses.

The details are not out yet in the public. According to media reports,
ministries and departments must measure the time and cost of compliance
requirements. The rationale behind licensing to be explained, as
departments are being asked to replace licences where possible with
simple registration processes or simplify process where the removal of
licences is not possible. Departments also have to justify the frequency
of renewals they demand.

Holding bureaucrats accountable for the pain they inflict through
compliance marks a structural break in the way India regulates and
controls businesses. There is a three-vector framework that is key to
Ease of Doing Business-rationalisation (rationalising the 1,100+ Acts
and 58,000+ compliances that govern businesses), simplification
(reducing the 3,100+ filings and 2,500+changes every year), and
digitisation (using the GST template of an API architecture that allows
straight-through-processing of filings from external systems, instead of
uploading documents to a government website with passwords). Viewing
compliance within this framework will facilitate the re-engineering that
the government is targeting.

Once you set in force a mindset change, and control the controllers,
there will be significant productivity gains for firms. One of the
biggest constraints to scale currently is the exponential increase in
compliance as a firm grows. Actual client data from Avantis Regtech
shows that a mid-sized manufacturing company spread across six different
states is regulated by over 5,000 compliances, approximately 100
licences and registrations-making for an average of two filings a day. A
small firm is faced by around 10 filings a month-not an easy task. The
proposed policy has suggested that the compliance burden should be
capped at an hour per month for start-ups. Our submission is that a
similar benchmark should be placed for micro and small firms.

The government has recognised the vision and passion of start-ups to
scale up, yet treats them on par with larger businesses when it comes to
compliance. Typically, start-ups are run by young, first-time
entrepreneurs, who have no idea what hits them when they are faced with
the heavy compliance requirements-a start-up working from a home
office/shared space, in its first year, needs to obtain registrations
under at least seven regulators and file a minimum of 18 returns to a
maximum of 69 returns. Not surprisingly, regulatory cholesterol is one
of the reasons for start-ups to lose heart-the failure rate of start-ups
is quite high, but closure can take more than two years!

The proposals regarding the vexatious angel tax issue are steps in the
right direction. Yet, so much more can be done to make it easy for a
start-up to begin operations, grow or exit if needed. Some compliance
requirements can be removed, for example, mandate only one board meeting
a year, instead of two, implement single window NOC clearances for
closure, have a single annual return for MCA instead of 4-5 now and an
annual TDS return instead of quarterly, etc. These are simple steps that
will make a world of difference to the life of a young entrepreneur, who
is out to take on the world.

Over the past five years, India's ranking has risen dramatically in the
World Bank Ease of Doing Business index from 130 to 77. But this
achievement has not really meant much for businesses in India struggling
under the weight of 58,000+ possible compliances and 3,100+ possible
filings annually. The government has now finally come through, and taken
on board the pain and stress of the compliance burden. The proposed
National Ease of Doing Business Policy can be a game-changer, making a
greater impact on growth and formal employment, than government
programmes and subsidies. It is time to remember the spirit and intent
of a regulatory framework-effective regulation need not be complicated,
control need not be cumbersome. It is time to bury the license raj and
inspector raj forever.

StartUp: Managing your startup's cash flow during a crisis

CIOL

July 1, 2020 Wednesday 6:30 AM EST

Cash has always been the blood of any successful business. Managing cash
for a startup efficiently has always been a pathway to create a
prosperous business. But like any business, start-ups also have issues
in managing cash in its initial years. However, in the times which we
are witnessing due to COVID-19, the entire economic system and supply
chain is paralyzed. The acute cash crunch has become a concern for every
next startup.

As per Crunchbase, 29% of startups have shut down had run out of cash.
And that's the second most common reason for failure in start-ups. Mind
it that this startup shut down due to cash flow issues only, and nothing
else.The times when businesses are down or even shut for months, it's
hard to pay off the liabilities, meet other expenses that are to be
incurred even if the operations are restricted for the time being.

There are no recoveries, monetizing the assets is tough, and liquidating
the investments is at times done at loss. The demand problem which
already existed in the Indian Economy since the previous 4 quarters has
further worsened. The supply chains are affected since there is no sync
in processes involved due to overall uncertainty. At such testing times,
start-ups need to be conservative with their cash as it is still
uncertain when things will get back to normal or precisely the new
normal will be adopted.

Following are some ways to efficiently work out cash woes in this phase
of the crisis:

1. Watch your expenses and look for substitutes

The discretionary spends must be avoided and the priorities must be
planned. Typically, expenses that directly result in immediate/short
term revenues are only to be continued until the situation improves.
Calculate and work out a reasonable pay for all the employees for the
time being. In these testing times, instead of laying off the employees,
it will be better to pay less than take off their source of livelihood.

Instead of increasing the people on your payroll/fixed costs, hiring
interns or contract basis professionals or even outsourcing a certain
job will be an economic option to get things done for the time being,
wherever possible. Or, the marketing techniques can move from other
mediums to more of organic marketing without any budget.

2. Keep looking for funding sources

Having a war chest always helps in survival and competing in turbulent
times. It's complicated to raise funds at the moment but take the time
to arrange cash for current as well as future business prospects.
Typically, the market observes correction in value to the affected
business and a bit of flexibility can be a better option in valuation if
the business is affected by the lockdown. There are different schemes
announced by the governments that should be taken benefit of, as and
when a start-up is eligible. Keep in touch with your consultants to be
aware of or obtain any guidance about any schemes and eligible benefits
which you can avail.

3. Manage the Receivables and Payables of your startup smartly

Give out offers and discounts to your debtors to release their payments
in time. B2C startups can give freebies to get more business until
normalcy returns. You could get discounts for making early settlements
or take some extended credit period if necessary. Make use of invoice
financing methods like purchase financing, factoring of receivables,
discounting of bills, etc.

4. Make use of your assets

Sell off assets which are not very useful as of now or shortly.
Rent/lease out the assets which are not in use now and can be rented or
leased out in the market. In extreme cases, the assets like buildings/
land are also sold to make up for the cash Even sale and leaseback of
assets can be done to financially support the start-up. Liquidate the
investments if necessary.

5. Pivot and grab available opportunities

If the startup is in the non-essential category, look for pivots into
essential categories for temporary use of available resources and to
keep the company floating. For e.g: A medical equipment startup has
started the sale of sanitizers, PPE and other hygiene products on the
website. These alternatives can be a good source to make some extra cash
and reduce the financial burden for the time being. However, make it a
point that the extra money which you are supposed to be earning doesn't
call for an undue amount of investments and it has to be done from the
existing available resources.

6. Be conservative with your upcoming plans

If the market is not favourable be conservative with your plans. Hold on
to the plans and execute them in time where they are more likely to
execute successfully. In this way, you won't end up spending your money
while there are no returns against it. Invest the time in researching
and analysing the correct time and techniques to adapt to the new normal
and make wise decisions. Make it a point to save cash as much as
possible, now and even for times to come. Take this crisis as a lesson
to realize how important it is to maintain sufficient cash balance at
all the points of time for emergencies and contingencies.

These were very few tips based on my personal opinions and observations.
There can be more ways depending upon your start-up model and nature of
business. However, the key is to observe the inflows and outflows
vigilantly. Keep adapting with times to ensure that the goals are met
without incurring excess financial obligations.

Someone said it right, business, growth, market penetration is all
superficial, but cash is real. It can't be more important than in this
situation!

DENVER, Aug. 3 -- The Environmental Protection Agency Region 7 office
issued the following news release:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today that it
issued seven Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Administrative Orders
between April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020. These Orders ensure public
health protection through compliance with drinking water standards at
public water systems located in Wyoming and on Region 8 tribal lands.

"Public drinking water systems must meet federal Safe Drinking Water Act
requirements that keep drinking water safe," said EPA Regional
Administrator Gregory Sopkin. "Through these seven orders, EPA is
helping ensure that public water systems protect the health of their
users."

EPA issued the seven orders to drinking water systems for violations of
the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations. These orders addressed
different violations at each facility and include orders to monitor lead
and copper, nitrate, total coliform bacteria, inorganic contaminants,
synthetic organic contaminants and volatile organic contaminants;

4 Common Mistakes Most SME's Do And How To Avoid Them

Business World

January 3, 2020

Body

SME's have a significant contribution to the Indian GDP and growth and,
as per a GoI report 'MSME At A Glance', SME's account for around 6.11%
of the manufacturing GDP and 24.63% of Service sector GDP. The sector
accounts for 45% of the total Indian manufacturing output and 40% of
India's total exports and currently employs about 106 million people -
amounting to 40% of India's workforce, which is second only to the
agricultural sector.

Despite the mammoth contribution and significance of the SME's and
MSME's in the Indian economy, the sector has been struggling with a lot
of challenges. Lack of an organised business structure and mentorship
remain the highest challenge. While MNC's and larger conglomerates
operate with a set of business advisors, financial and business analysts
and life coaches for varied aspects of business, SME's generally lack
the insight, resources and inclination to reach out and seek external
advice from a professional. As a result, there are some very common
mistakes that SME's and MSME's continue to make, impacting their growth.

In recent years, however, there has been a steady rise in the number of
mentors and business consultants specifically catering to Start-up's,
SME's, MSME's and first-generation entrepreneurs, helping them navigate
through complex challenges of 21st-century global marketplaces.

Listed here are the 5 key mistakes most SME's and MSME's make and how
these can be avoided with the help of a business consultant or mentor:

Lack of long term vision:

Most SME's start with a long term vision but in the course of time,
after managing daily challenges and internal bottlenecks etc., somewhere
lose themselves in basic survival. Others may become too engrossed or
even satisfied with their state of business, getting comfortable with it
and losing sight of growth and expansion. This can be addressed with the
help of an external consultant or a mentor, who can help to not only
draft a systematic long term growth chart but also work together to
ensure the same is followed. Through consistent follow-up and support, a
mentor or consultant help address short term challenges and neutralise
set-backs by devising a strategic growth trajectory that is practical
and achievable.

Lack of Focus on core competencies:

With the increasing competition and volatility in the market, several
entrepreneurs and SME's have taken to the diversification of business or
have added new services and products to their portfolio, so as to remain
relevant to the consumers. While this is a good strategy, it can often
lead to lack of focus on the core competency. Having started with a
focused approach with a product or a service, which was the flagship
initiative of the company, most SME's and MSME's tend to lose their edge
while trying to accommodate or adapt to newer, diversified businesses.
This could spell doom for the business, leading to diminished chances of
growth and also, finally, failure. Start-up consultants and mentors can
extremely help here to strategize a growth plan that involves healthy
diversification while retaining a clear focus on the core competencies
and enhancing them, in the face of the dynamic market scenario.

Hesitant to learn and upgrade skills:

Every business in the 21st century is evolving at a rapid pace, thanks
to the consistent innovation in business processes and the ever-changing
consumer landscape. This makes it almost inevitable to escape these
changes, and staying away from them or not upgrading the skill sets as
an entrepreneur, may result in an eventual failure in business. While
most SME's and MSME's look at skill up-gradation, training of staff and
team and continuous learning as an investment burden, if done right, it
has the potential to not only ensure they continue to remain in business
but can also grow exponentially and thrive by weeding out the
competition. These insights and also guidance on cost-effective ways of
skill up-gradation can be brought to the table by a mentor and business
coach, who can help break down the pro's and con's while showcasing the
big picture.

Slow adoption of technology:

Technology today has become an inevitable aspect of every area of life,
from healthcare, entertainment, leisure, and wellness to business
processes across sectors. The recent start-up wave brought in a new
level of technology-enabled business and personal lifestyle disruptions
that have transformed the way we live and work in the 21st century.
Despite this, a large number of SME's and MSME's continue to shy away
from adopting cost-effective, and efficient technology solutions and
continue to rely on manual labour. Sometimes this is due to lack of
awareness, while at other times it could purely be a case of perceptions
or sceptical outlook to technology. Through positive counsel, showcasing
success stories and effective hand-holding, external business
consultants and mentors can help identify and implement effective
technology solutions for SME's and MSMSe's, which can be beneficial for
them in the long run.

Way Forward:

Apart from the above-mentioned points, some basic factors like
effectively leveraging government policies, efficient financial planning
and revenue generation, smart marketing techniques and tools and
adequate focus on collaboration are some of the other areas where SME's
and entrepreneurs can seek help and benefit. The growing number of
Millennial entrepreneurs are turning out to be business savvy and are
seeking help and support of external business mentors, thereby ensuring
they can make the best of the economic and financial opportunity in the
market.

The Innovation & Entrepreneurship Lab ("the Lab") by the African
Development Bank (AfDB) is part of the Boost Africa initiative that aims
at creating quality jobs and enhancing innovation on the African
continent by supporting start-ups. The Lab strengthens the local
entrepreneurial ecosystems necessary for start-ups to grow and become
successful.

Background The creation of quality jobs is crucial to absorb Africa's
rapidly growing population. The number of African start-ups with
innovative and successful business approaches has been increasing in
recent years. However, they face considerable challenges in growing
their businesses, such as the lack of financing and capacities.
Experience to date has shown that success and failure of start-ups also
critically depend on their entrepreneurial ecosystem. A strong ecosystem
enables collaboration and thereby enhances knowledge sharing, investment
opportunities and innovation among the various actors.

Objectives Boost Africa aims to create quality jobs and enhance
innovation on the African continent by supporting start-ups and early
stage, innovative businesses.Its Innovation and Entrepreneurship Lab,
managed by the African Development Bank, strengthens the entrepreneurial
ecosystem needed for start-ups to grow. It improves the capacities of
enterprise-supporting organizations (ESOs), such as incubators and
accelerators and strengthens the collaboration of regional and local
networks. It facilitates linkages between the various actors in an
entrepreneurial ecosystem, for example between investors and incubators,
accelerators and start-ups.

Medium-term outcomes The Lab targets three main outcomes:1) an
increasing number of start-ups have access to and make use of quality
services offered by enterprise-supporting organizations (ESOs)-2) the
entrepreneurial ecosystems are improved and foster linkages, innovation
and knowledge sharing3) more start-ups have access to financing

Corporate connect: Success mantra for startups

Startups are new avenues for creating wealth, while generating
employment. Indian startups are deploying unique business models,
converging market acumen with technological expertise. Some operate on
new service delivery models, directly catering to users, others target
niche tech areas, such as new medical devices, algorithms for improving
diesel engine efficiency, design and fabrication of small satellites,
and so on. They have also emerged as the top career option for many
graduates from leading business and tech schools.

The success of startups depends upon a 'complete' innovation and
financing ecosystem, comprising of incubators providing appropriate
technology and hardware systems, effective mentoring, access to easy
finance, assistance in the marketing of products and services, etc. Such
ecosystems have played a crucial role towards creating startup havens in
Silicon Valley, Cambridge (the UK), Tel Aviv, and Bengaluru.

In order to leverage our 1.3 billion minds, we need myriad startups
spawning from a multitude of ideas for every conceivable service,
application or social benefit. The PM's clarion call of 'Start-up India,
Stand up India' highlights the multiplier effect startups can have for
the economy and also their direct impact on fostering creativity and
innovation.

Many startups have succeeded in e-commerce and IT-based applications of
the services sector. But they are yet to take off in a big way in the
manufacturing sector. We need to accelerate the spread of the startup
movement in agriculture, manufacturing, education, healthcare, and other
areas. Under 'Start-up India', 12,298 startups have been successfully
recognised by DIPP. The scheme provides incentives such as tax exemption
for three years, benefits for IPR, relaxation in public procurement
norms, and faster exit options, among others.

As of August 2018, there are more than 260 unicorns-or companies
reaching $1 billion valuation-around the world; India has 13 of them,
including Ola, Hike, InMobi, Quikr, One97 and ReNew Power. However,
given the nature of entrepreneurship, nearly 90% startups are seen to
fail within the first 3-5 years (as many as 1,000 startups closed down
in 2016). The highest number of failures were recorded in the logistics,
e-commerce and food technology sectors. The major factors for failure
include lack of market need, shortage of funding, gaps in the team,
competitiveness, poor marketing, or product mistiming.

Corporate connect: A novel approach

The high rate of startup failures calls for newer strategies for
improved success rates. Mentoring by external experts or providing easy
finance may not prove beneficial in the long run-understanding market
needs is more important.

To address this issue, a novel approach is to link them with large
corporate houses in allied business areas. In our new initiative to
facilitate this 'corporate connect', startups are nurtured with specific
knowledge inputs and also supported with adequate financing by large
corporates. In the process, the startups develop products or services
catering to the needs of large corporates. Thus, they are quickly
becoming an integral part of the supply chain or devising newer
technologies for better efficiency or productivity.

In due course of time, corporates may also invest substantially in these
startups, helping them stand on their feet. Such a dedicated corporate
connect with the startups will go a long way in helping ideas germinate
into appropriate end-uses and ensuring the success rates of
startupreneurs. On an encouraging note, many companies have already
signed on to such a programme to strengthen the startup ecosystem.

Promising startups must be recognised for excellence in cutting-edge
technology and innovation, wealth creation, and employment generation.
Financial support and mentorship for startups with the point of view of
potential business partnership will aid them in scaling up their
businesses.

Chandigarh [India], May 10 (ANI): Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra
Modi-led government, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that
while China provides its people 50,000 jobs in 24 hours, the Indian
government had snatched jobs from 24,000 youth.

"India needs employment. The country is suffering because of
unemployment. China government gives 50,000 jobs in 24 hours while
Indian government snatches jobs from 24,000 youth at the same time.
Narendra Modi said Make in India, Start up India but the employment is
at an all-time high in 45 years," Rahul said at an election rally here.

Elaborating his poll promise about entrepreneurs not needing permission
to run business for the first three years, the Congress president said:
"I want to tell youth, especially those in Chandigarh, we have to
compete with China. Not only Made in India, we have to print 'Made in
Chandigarh' on cellphones. Startup India is a failure."

"Today, if an entrepreneur wants to start his business, he has to seek
permission from the government. When we come to power if someone wants
to start his business, compete with China and give employment to Indians
then he will not need any permission from the government for the first
three years," he said.

Campaigning for party candidate Pawan Kumar Bansal here, the Congress
leader said, "It is said that Chandigarh is a planned city. It will
become the international centre. People of Haryana and Punjab want to
see an international airport in Chandigarh. Permission has been sought.
Narendra Modi did not want to give an airport to this city."

Bansal won three times in a row from Chandigarh but in 2014 BJP's Kirron
Kher had wrested the constituency from him.

Chandigarh will go to polls on May 19 in the last phase of the election.
The counting of votes will take place on May 23. (ANI)

AHMEDABAD: To encourage entrepreneurs and enable them to grow, experts
at a panel discussion organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Gujarat, emphasized creating a healthy
startup ecosystem. The discussion was held in Ahmedabad on Saturday.
Experts said that startups are centres of innovation with potential to
enhance employment generation in any economy.Parag Amin, co-founder and
chief mentor of iCreate, who was a panellist, said, "India is adding
roughly a million jobs a month to the workforce which will continue for
the next 25 years. India is the global buying class of the future and in
the coming years a lot in the sectors of manufacturing will look towards
India. It is important that startups here focus on innovation and have
the hunger to disrupt."About a good ecosystem, Chirag Patel, former
president of TiE, said, "If you create the right ecosystem, talent gets
moulded the proper way which is crucial to a startup. One must learn to
address problems and add value, as it will determine success or
failure."On the IT start-up scenario, Akash Bhavsar, a panelist, said,
"There are lot of opportunities in IT and Internet of Things
(IOT)-driven startups. In five years, more activities will happen in
sectors like pharma and healthcare, engineering, chemical and
petrochemicals." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

When a major machinery breaks down because of electrical issues or
component failure, you lose money every hour! This requires scalable,
sustainable, and cost-effective monitoring to maximise runtime
productivity and reduce expense on maintenance. Industry 4.0 is
revolutionising manufacture and maintenance with the help of
sensor-based technology that can help save time, prevent costly
downtime, and increase profits.

MachineSense, headquartered in Baltimore (Maryland, USA) with R&D
offices in Kolkata, focuses on predictive maintenance and machine
analytics for infrastructure systems, industrial machinery, and
components including pumps, electrical supply, and compressors. They
specialise in IoT solutions for pumps and machines, electrical IoT
solutions, vertical OEM solutions, and public safety solutions.

Their detection technology for vibration, temperature and electrical
power is offered at a price point affordable for every industrial unit.
Their platform offers 24/7 availability for online monitoring.

Vibration analysis assesses health of the rotational components of
machines for issues in a bearing, blower, or a broken tooth in gearbox.
Electrical characteristics are used to analyse electrical sub-systems to
understand specific power quality anomalies within industrial and
commercial power settings.

In this technology, the MEMS-based wearable sensors can be easily
attached to the outside of the machine or components to automatically
monitor their condition on a regular basis. The sensor data is
transmitted to an easy-to-install gateway, from where it is further sent
to a cloud-based server running powerful analytic software. The server
transmits results to a user-friendly app, where one can view real-time
machine condition to give maintenance advice when required.

The software packages installed across all industrial machinery provide
a status dashboard of all connected assets such as analytics,
histograms, and maintenance, repairs and operational advice. Local
machine intelligence is allocated to mobile apps to provide gauge
visualisations and maintenance corrective action alerts.

The Wi-Fi- and Ethernet-enabled data hub can connect with multiple
sensors that enable edge computing for at-site storage and analytics.
Its advanced meta-data analytics engine provides deep machine learning
and statistical analysis. It never records process data, and never takes
control of the machine or components, to avoid potential security
threats.

Along with strong analytics and trusted data sources, there are also
industrial IoT (IIoT) tools for downtime reduction of sensors, edge
devices, or sensor connectivity.

The scalability of the product or system becomes an issue when the
number of sensors and devices exceeds, say, 250 in an IIoT system. As
every device has to be brought up to the same firmware or middleware
version, connectivity becomes a major challenge in that case. To
mitigate these challenges, one has to update the algorithms in the
device as well, using OTT (over the top) architecture.

Only 25 per cent of start-up companies reach a meaningful scale: Vani
Kola

The Founder of Kalaari Capital Advisors shares her thoughts on start-up
firms and India's current position in the ecosystem  

In 2006, Vani Kola returned to India after a successful career as an
entrepreneur in Silicon Valley and started Indo-US Venture Partners,
which was re-named six years later as Kalaari Capital Advisors. The
re-branded firm started operations as a $150-million fund in 2012, and
has made more than 30 investments across e-commerce, gaming, digital
content and healthcare sectors and its success is synonymous with names
such as Dream11, Myntra and Snapdeal among others.

A proponent for India's digital opportunity to create next-generation
large-scale companies, Kola's investment philosophy is derived from her
entrepreneurial ventures. In an interview with BusinessLine, Kola, the
Founder and Managing Director of Kalaari Capital, equates start-ups with
extreme sports that are prone to failures, and talks about the new
₹1,700-crore fund. Excerpts:-

To begin with, how has Covid-19 impacted the industry on the funding
front?

The pandemic has accelerated the digital signature, and companies
dependent on the digital economy have significantly benefited. In the
first few months of this year itself, we have seen about $6.5 billion of
growth investments come into these firms. The digital acceleration
favours the start-up community because they are the 'disruption
economy'.

The new companies focused on technology 'enablement' can get Seed and
Series-A funding, as those two volumes on the barbell have stayed
strong. The middle-child problem is for companies scouting for Series B
and C funding, while that in Seed and Series A space are vibrant, and
the digital-first firms are also doing fine. The crisis is also
sometimes an opportunity, as the startup ecosystem has been vibrant in
the first quarter, with close to 300 companies getting funds. There is
definitely sunshine on this industry.

On the start-up front, we are only seeing the bright side of the story
like India already has 40 Unicorns? What about the failures?

A start-up is like an extreme sport. You should expect significant
failures, which is the name of the game, not just in India but globally.
Idea-to-execution, and founder-to-leader are journeys, and the
fascination is because it is a great story - a David and Goliath story.
It is about human triumph and human vulnerability. At least 50 per cent
of the companies will not even get any funding, and of the remaining
that get funding, maybe 25 per cent will reach a meaningful scale, of
which only 10 per cent will hit home-runs.

Also Read: Indian companies raise ₹31,265 cr through 30 IPOs this
financial year

The IPO market was vibrant, with Indian companies raising over ₹31,000
crore in FY21, while M&A deals at 161 in April, was the highest in the
last decade. Comments?

I wish we were in this place five years ago. I think companies have
achieved a particular scale, and there is also maturity in the market to
embrace these firms; a better understanding of what these companies are
and how to value them. As a country, we have been used to asset-heavy
industries at one level. We are also a country that has claimed its
place in IT services, which is a knowledge economy, where assets were
human resources. We haven't focused on how these knowledge economy
companies should be evaluated.

What is Kalaari Capital's strategy on investments going forward?

We are passionate about early-stage investing and the early-stage
economy. For us, the privilege is discovering that founder who has a
great idea, potential and needs to be supported and then deliver
extraordinary value. We want to be the lead investor in those companies
with first-time founders looking to raise risk capital, who have great
ideas and who want to build great companies. That hasn't changed in the
last 15 years.

So new markets keep emerging, and we will continue to build to those
themes, but being a lead investor in Seed or Series-A from
technology-leveraged opportunities with the right founders will not
change in the next decade for Kalaari. Typically, we invest in about ten
companies a year.

Kalaari Capital is believed to have roped in Jio Platforms as an LP for
its fourth fund?

I am proud of the returns we have generated to date, and even in Fund-I
(2006), we returned 2.7 times, which is high even by global standards.
We have already returned all the invested capital from our Fund II and
our opportunity fund, and both those funds are tracking to four times
return.

With the fourth fund, we want to do better than that in the past. This
is a ₹1,700-crore fund, of which we have closed about ₹800 crore. The
rest we are not actively raising funds due to the pandemic, but it will
be raised within the stipulated time.

You invested in companies that were almost written off and turned them
around. How would you explain that?

Maybe, we see something that others don't see when it comes to
investment. We spend a lot of time understanding a company, and if we
develop the conviction for the company and the person, then we invest in
them and stay invested for a long time. We also look at all other stuff
that might have happened before, not just the Cinderella becoming the
princess story.

Why hasn't India developed a strong Limited Partners (LP) base?

The first cycle of Venture Capital exits were relatively slow, hence
returns were quite low and LPs had a lot of concern. A group of North
American LPs had invested along with the first wave of fund-raising.
India has a vibrant domestic market from a startup perspective but no
domestic investors. So developing a strong Indian LP base is not
happening because capital doesn't exist in India. Having LPs that are
domestic LPs supporting domestic funds is just a smart strategy from a
country perspective, which is growing now.

IIM Bangalore's incubator NSRCEL looks to enhance its footprint, first
in Mumbai and then in New Delhi

Bangalore, Jan. 13 -- NSRCEL, the innovation and entrepreneurial centre
at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, launched its 20-year
celebrations of nurturing entrepreneurs across industries, with The
Dialogue, a panel discussion on 'Bootstrapped vs Funding: what's best
for your startup?', in Mumbai, this afternoon.

According to Prof. Venkatesh Panchapagesan, Chair, NSRCEL at IIMB, "The
idea is to bring together bright minds to share experiences that are
idea-focused and relevant to the entrepreneur, to foster learning and to
provoke conversations that count."

Prof. Suresh Bhagavatula, Chair, Entrepreneurship area at IIMB and
Program Director for several entrepreneurship programs run by the
school, said: "The founder-patron of NSRCEL, Mr. N.S. Raghavan, always
wanted us to grow our presence, as an early-stage incubator, outside of
Bangalore and, thanks to support from our partners and alumni, we have
made a beginning here in Mumbai."

Describing the journey of IIMB's open, early-stage incubator, Prof.
Panchapagesan said: "When IIMB set up NSRCEL 20 years ago, we were the
only game in town. Now, there is a proliferation of players. But we
stand apart not only because we provide a safe space for entrepreneurs
but also because we build a body of research, build a community that
supports entrepreneurs and mentor sticky stakeholders. Only a public
institution like IIMB can do this."

In his keynote address, Karthik Reddy, Co-founder and Managing Partner
at Blume Ventures, one of India's early stage Venture funds, offered a
framework of funding for start-ups and shared examples of companies that
have tread both paths. "The existential question for entrepreneurs, when
they must choose a route, remains, 'is this what I am signing up for?'
Entrepreneurs must ask themselves what kind of capital should be taken
for what kind of outcome. They must ask themselves what is the market
size and opportunity they are chasing." He also urged entrepreneurs to
evaluate their ability to scale before taking institutional capital.

The keynote was followed by a panel discussion featuring Imran Jafar,
Managing Partner at Gaja Capital, Vineeta Singh, CEO of SUGAR Cosmetics,
Poyni Bhatt, Founding team member of SINE, the technology business
incubator at IIT Bombay, and Deepa Krishnan, Founder of Magic Tours of
India. The discussion was moderated by Prof. Suresh Bhagavatula.

On how to get talented young people take the entrepreneurial route in
the face of the lure of big pay checks, Poyni suggested that a few
successes (role models) often pave the way for more risk takers. She
recalled the days when she faced irate parents of IIT-ians who demanded
to know how their wards would find marriage proposals if they traded the
security of a pay check for the adrenalin-rush of a start-up! "In order
to stay relevant, an

academic incubator must play to its strength, strengthen its offerings
by way of its infrastructure and funding, and extend its networks," she
observed. Adding to Poyni's views, Imran said: "For instance, IIMB can
be the custodian of Indian stories of entrepreneurship. Top B-schools
should also tweak the admissions criteria to choose risk takers rather
than the risk averse."

Deepa Krishnan spoke of her motivators - job creation, wealth
distribution and social impact, and explained why bootstrapping works
for her as in all her decisions about money, she asks herself what
brings her joy.

Imran argued that there is no right or wrong as long as entrepreneurs
know their risk appetite and ability to scale. He called for tech and
product innovation, which needs extremely patient capital - for which,
he said, the ecosystem still does not exist in India.

"Scarcity of money (read capital) does not build character - contrary to
what we Indians are taught to believe," he declared, adding that the top
reasons for failure of a start-up is that their product or service is
not a validated by market need, they run out of cash, and/or they have
no teams apart from the founder(s).

The rise of mega-rockets, such as SpaceX's Starship, could make or break
the 'New Space' industry, according to experts.

Countries including South Korea, Japan, India and UAE are planning to
launch their first missions the Moon, which will require the use of
so-called mega-rockets.

"Public enthusiasm for space will remain high with the launch of new
mega-rockets in the coming year," CEO of Seraphim Space, Mark Boggett
said. "This includes NASA's giant moon rocket and SpaceX's
next-generation Starship, to return humans to the moon and some day to
Mars."

Such missions have captured not only starry-eyed investors' hearts, but
also their wallets.

The space economy has breezed through yet another record year for
private capital investment, swallowing $12.4bn in 2021 - an increase of
more than 60 per cent from the year before, London-listed Seraphim Space
found.

And Boggett expects this momentum to continue, though the industry
currently at an "inflection point".

Risky business

As Elon Musk's space company scrambles to patch-up production issues on
Starship's Raptor engines ahead of its orbital test flight early this
year, the future of the company and the wider space economy hangs in the
balance, research and analytics firm GlobalData has cautioned.

"SpaceX has made great strides in making space commercially viable, but
Starship is by far its most ambitious and risky project," associate
analyst Francesca Gregory explained.

"Operating at the edge of the laws of physics, the launch vehicle's
unrivaled payload and turnaround time will see space assume a similar
business model to commercial aviation. If Starship can operate
effectively, it will be a watershed moment. Access to space will be
unparalleled, unlocking the potential for a commercial space boom."

If the ambitious Starship falters, however, it could spook investors out
of the sector and curb increasing levels of SPAC activity among the
sector's start-ups.

"A critical failure from Starship will shake confidence in the industry,
stifling investors' appetites for risky bets," she explained, adding "It
is clear that the outcome of the orbital test flight has repercussions
for wider space economy funding."

However, Boggett noted that while SPACs will be "more challenging" this
year, the pipeline remains strong for communications and
climate-focussed firms.
