Between juggling multiple dream projects and managing investors as well
as consumer expectations, startup founders have a tough job. But is it
easier for second-time entrepreneurs? This week on YourStory UNCUT,
seasoned entrepreneur Brijraj Bhuptani answers this question.

Between juggling multiple dream projects and managing investors as well
as consumer expectations, startup founders have a tough job. But is it
easier for second-time entrepreneurs?

This week on YourStory UNCUT, seasoned entrepreneur Brijraj Bhuptani
answers this question.

Former Chief Product and Technology Officer at Ola, Brijraj shares his
entrepreneurial journey so far from founding Ridlr, to working at Ola,
and then starting Spry in May last year, which he runs currently.

While Brijraj and his team at Ridlr worked on several cool projects in
the early years of his entrepreneurship journey, he also had to learn
some tough lessons.

Looking back at the hurdles today, Brijraj believes that hard work is
not always the way out of challenging times.

"During childhood, we are taught that 'mehnat karo, kuch na kuch ho
jayega' (work hard and you will figure something out), but that is not
always the case," he says, adding that there should be deep
introspection about what one does, and how they do it. Read more.

The Interview

Suhani Shah is a mentalist who has been ruling the internet with her
tricks and performances. In this episode of #InfluencersInc by
YourStory, Suhani talks about her journey in the world of magic and
discusses future plans.

In this week's App Friday, we looked at the Neend app, which is
currently available free of cost on the Google Play Store. It offers
stories, sleep sounds, and meditation techniques in English, Hindi, and
Marathi.

The app aims to add more regional languages so users can consume
relatable content. Read more.

A Bijliride to success

Bijliride is a Hyderabad-based electric scooter rental company
addressing both climate control and economical travel options.

It offers daily, weekly, and monthly rental subscription services for
electric vehicles across Hyderabad. The startup also offers 24X7
customer service, on-road battery swapping within 30 minutes and minimal
recharging costs at stations. Read more.

Billionaire Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share,
in an all-cash deal, according to the US SEC filing. Musk bought a 9.3
percent stake in the company earlier this month, becoming the largest
shareholder in the social media platform.

Kotak Bank has temporarily halted payments to and from their exchange
partner CoinSwitch Kuber. While there has been no official communication
on halting financial services for crypto exchanges, the current
regulatory environment has encouraged caution.

space, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) told WhatsApp
it could roll out its UPI payments service to 60 million additional
users, taking the total number it can cater to 100 million total users.

Ethereum scaling project Polygon announced its partnership with tech
upskilling startup AlmaBetter to offer blockchain and Web 3.0
development courses. The collaborative programme aims to assist young
professionals, and AlmaBetter plans to utilise Polygon's resources to
produce training modules for its students to establish a foothold in the
rapidly increasing Web 3.0 upskilling sector.

Nearly a year after it announced the acquisition of a significant
majority stake in indigenous app store Indus OS, Walmart-backed payments
company PhonePe has reached an out-of-court settlement with investors in
the company blocking the deal.

Entrepreneur Pavan Reddy Appakonda tells us the reasons for the failure
of most Indian start-ups

As an entrepreneur, I'm familiar with the concept of failure. I've made
mistakes in the past; some are big blunders. At the same time, however,
I've been lucky enough to be successful on several occasions. Along the
journey, I've understood some of the lesser-known reasons for start-up
failure and, more significantly, why a few flourish, says Pavan Reddy
Appakonda, an Indian entrepreneur, software engineer, and investor.

India has the third-largest start-up environment in the world. As a
result, it takes a significant amount of effort for a business to break
into the market. However, we can see how Indian companies fail at a
higher rate than any other country.

India is still a developing country, but the government is coming up
with big names like "Vocal for Local" and "Made in India". It could be
the ideal opportunity to take a shot. But first, let us examine why
Indian companies fail at such a high rate. Last week, I talked with a
couple of start-up Founders, we discussed different reasons for the
failures.

Wrong Market

Too many people attempt to establish a business to reach everyone as
customers. This is not going to turn out nicely. Following that, they
try to target everyone in their town. Once again, the scope is too
broad. Your niche will be easier to market to if you narrow it down even
more.

Inadequate Research

Entrepreneurs must understand the needs of their target market. Too many
would-be entrepreneurs enter the market believing that they have
superior service or product, only to discover that no one is interested
in their service or product. They will know precisely how to address the
wants of their potential clients if they have done their homework and
researched their market thoroughly.

Market shifts

People who start a business sometimes have a good idea of the market,
but then the market changes before they have time to adapt to those
changes. The coronavirus pandemic was a great example of how the market
changed, making many businesses struggle or fail. Shutdowns and capacity
restrictions made many companies and restaurants lose a lot of business,
and it took a long time for some customers to feel safe enough to come
back.

Failure of a business concept

A strong product, an eye-catching website, and hefty advertising
budgets-many entrepreneurs believe that these qualities will be
sufficient to attract clients and business. However, attracting new
customers and retaining existing ones are expensive endeavours, and
start-ups must have a failsafe business plan to succeed.

Leadership gaps

The majority of start-ups are propelled forward by the vision of their
founders and core team members. On the other hand, having a solid idea
is considerably less critical than knowing how to lead a brand, a
company, and a team. Another frequent factor for start-ups failure is a
lack of vision and effective leadership.

Bad Partnership

A business partner is frequently required when launching a new company.
One of you knows a lot about one thing, and there's another who knows
plenty about something else. Internal discord will ensue if you disagree
on how to proceed with the company. Your partner feels they are working
harder than you, even though you are working more. Due to the failure of
the cooperation, the company is eventually shut down. You may avoid most
disagreements by establishing a clear company strategy that lays out the
responsibilities of each partner.

Problems with finances

Another common reason for start-up failure is a lack of funding.
Investors and venture capitalists fund most businesses until their
product or service generates revenue. If that does not happen quickly
enough, investors often baulk at continuing to invest in it.

If the start-up fails to secure additional money as the old capital runs
out, it will soon find itself unable to meet operating expenses. Cash
flow issues are a significant cause of start-up failure. Even if
investors don't leave, new enterprises can fail if they don't match
client needs or charge too much or too little.

Incapability to grow from blunders

There will be errors, miscalculations, and failures in any start-up.
Most start-ups have numerous ups and downs on their journey to success.
Start-ups often fail because they cannot learn from their mistakes and
modify their strategy to become more successful.

Ignoring clients

Often, start-up founders have too much on their plate. They have to deal
with funding, hiring new employees, managing the whole company, etc.
Customers may not even be on their lists of things to do. Many people
don't think about this, which can be the root of many start-up failures.

Loss of enthusiasm towards the venture

Many business founders have a short attention span: they fall in love
with a concept but are tired of it before it reaches its full potential.
A start-up's leadership will fail if they lose passion for the idea or
product too early. For example, founders can sell their start-up to
someone else to run with it or incorporate it into their vision. Sadly,
few entrepreneurs who lose their passion ever regain it. Many business
founders' creative and restless temperament has long been a factor in
start-up failure.

Pavan says, around nine out of ten firms fail. That is a prominent
figure, showing that numerous factors must align for a business to
prosper. There are thousands of start-ups in India, and some will
succeed in the following years. Any start-up with a creative idea,
thorough research, and capable leaders may succeed anywhere globally.

New Delhi, Dec. 7 -- Read a biography charting Mamata Banerjee's rise
from a student leader to the first woman Chief Minister of West Bengal
and how she could be a possible "kingmaker" after the 2019 general
elections; take in a novel set against the backdrop of old Punjab, early
California and revolution-torn Mexico; read a fictional tale that pits
debt-laden farmers against the political forces at work; and finally,
get a peek into the world of start-ups in India.

For the weekend, we have these four amazing paperbacks by debut authors
to suggest to our dear readers for a delightful read!

Author: Shutupa Paul |Titled "Didi", as West Bengal Chief Minister
Mamata Banerjee is often referred to, the book explores her struggles
and achievements, and opens a window to the life and times of Banerjee,
described by the author as "one of the most dynamic politicians of our
country." It looks in detail at "her unique style of politics", which
enabled her to defeat the formidable Left Front government in the state
in 2011.

selfless love, fortitude, friendship, and the quest for land and
identity. It is set against the backdrop of old Punjab, early California
and revolution-torn Mexico.

Author: Namita Waikar | This novel weaves a story around Vidarbha's
farmer suicides, where yet another farmer commits suicide, and is
survived by his son Vikram Sonare. The book unfolds the "epic mission"
he undertakes to draw attention to the plight of farmers and other
underprivileged sections of society, and finally mobilise millions of
people to march into the major cities of India. After the success of the
march, the group transforms into a revolutionary political party.

Author: Shabnam Aggarwal | As the author believed that every
entrepreneur could be successful, so she left her cushy job, find her
passion and make a difference in the world. She moved to India to start
a company. In "Freedom to Fail", she tells the story of her brush with
success: Raising her first round of venture capital; hiring a
hardworking team of millennials; growing her start-up to multiple
cities... and then finding it all come to a bitter end.

Biggest startup failures till date you can learn from

Failure in any startup, mobile app or even a project is dreaded from the
core. In this piece, I am going to discuss some of the biggest failures
in the tech industry.

Success of a start-up is never certain. As a matter of fact, 90% of the
startups fail before they could shine under the sun. However, the
optimism in the UpStarts has still managed to create companies and
products all the times in the history.

People always come up with some great and unique ideas for their
start-ups. But unfortunately, there are some start-ups which face a
massive failure despite a great idea behind it. Even the most useful and
seemingly revolutionary of the ideas eventually turn out to be a failure
due to many reasons.

While there is a myriad of factors as to why startups and mobile apps
fail, there are a lot of factors which just cannot be attributed as the
element of failure. Here in this article, we will look at some of the
biggest start-up/mobile app failures, the idea behind them and what
could be learned from their failure stories.

1. HAILO

Let us see what the basic idea behind Hailo was. Hailo is a mobile
application used for calling cabs using your smartphone. It is similar
to Uber but instead of having black cars with drivers, it connects you
to the network of yellow cabs. It came into existence in 2011 in London,
and was doing really great until 2013 with over $100 million invested in
it. But by the end of 2014, it crashed down. Despite having such a great
and useful idea, it broke down due to following reasons:

There was intense competition in the market. With Uber coming up with
new market strategies, it made things difficult for Hailo. When in New
York the decision was made to legalise the e-taxi service, Ubers and
other similar services tried to grab the opportunity. With such tough
competition, Hailo could not cope up.

Another reason for failure was their flawed business model. As Hailo was
a London based start-up where there are luxury cabs and confusing
streets. People are dependent on them for their up and down. But as far
as New York is concerned, the taxi drivers are less trained, and many of
them do not carry a smartphone. The owners did not do much market
research and suffered a failure.

Seeing the story of Hailo, it can be concluded that you need to keep in
mind that somebody out there might be having the same idea as yours. Two
things that the Hailo ignored was marketing and targeting the correct
audience. They failed in their marketing strategy and secondly, targeted
the inappropriate audience. They offered a solution for a problem the
people are not even facing. To sum up, they failed to adapt.

2. GOOGLE WAVE

Released on May 27 way back in 2009, Google wave was supposed to be a
game changer but unfortunately it failed to do so. The main idea was to
let you communicate and collaborate in real time. This means that using
Google Wave you multiple users can edit a same document at the same
time, or maybe for a group discussion. This seemed on papers but
practically it was a failure.

The Google Wave failed due to multiple reasons:

People could not really understand what it was. Google failed at
explaining the purpose it served and how it is useful to them. No one
actually knew what it was.

It could not meet the expectations of the people. Even if people didn't
know much about it, then also they gave it a try but the soaring
expectations could not be met. They considered it to be kind of
new-Gmail which it was not.

Even if some used it, the product was really complex to use. There was
too much of confusion and hustle while using it at the user end.

From this failure, it is a message for those dreaming of their start-up
to make sure to explain your product and idea well. What your product
it, what problem does it solve or in simple terms paint a picture of
what you are offering to the people. And one more thing; keep things
simple. Initiate with a few useful features which serve your purpose
well. And then gradually add on new features.

3. Govworks.com

Founded way back in 1998, Govworks.com was help to connect the
government with their clients. The idea was to facilitate the users with
the payment and use of government's producers and regulations. Using
this, clients can keep track of their contracts, apply for jobs, pay
tickets or look up for city information. The company was doing fine and
grew from 8 to 250 employees in 2 years.

But it too encountered failure. There were some issues amongst the
founders, who were actually childhood friends. Also they offended some
of the government officials and released the information about not yet
official statements. Their company software had few bugs which they were
not able to fix. Due to all this the company was sold in January 2001.

This start-up failure is a good example of "Never letting your ego come
in-between your business". You need to treat your customers and partners
well for your business to grow. And if you believe that they need to use
your service anyhow then you are surely in some misconception. Also, a
good start-up idea won't be successful unless it is backed up with a
good business model and practice.

4. DOORMINT

India has a huge population of 1.2 billion people. It is definitely a
great market for a laundry business. This was the idea behind the start
of Doormint. They served on demand laundry services to 1.2 people of
Mumbai, Bangalore and Gurgaon. The start-up was doing fine in the
initial stage but soon things became unmanageable.

There were many reasons for the failure. So of them are:

Many of the middle class people have a housemaid who along with washing
clothes performs other household chores in a much lesser time as
compared to Doormint.

Also there were issues like low ticket size, pickup delivery cost and
quality management. They were unable to perform a good budget
management.

Damage or defect in the garment which was not seen during pickup
resulted in mismatch of expectations during delivery.

The founders did not consider all the factors before releasing their
product in the market. Or rather they ignored the factors like household
maid or the local dhobi. They made several assumptions about the problem
which went wrong during execution. So it's an advice to do a complete
research beforehand.

5. EVERPIX

Everpix came up with an idea to sort and organize your photos in online
storage. You need not trawl through hundreds of photos to look up for a
particular shot. They used a certain algorithm to sort and organize your
pics. Started in 2009, it managed around 55,000 users by 2012 but broke
down by 2013.

It failed due to 2 major problems:

1. Although the app was easy to use, had a clean design with lots of
functionalities, but great products don't come at cheap rates. By the
time it entered in the market, the company was out of money as well as
time to raise the capital. Due to this, they could not manage a
sustainable number of users.

2. Due to this shortage of capital, they needed to sell their app to the
users to raise funds but they decided not to.

From their failure, others need to understand that you need to market
your product. Although the purpose is to deliver product to the users,
but you also need to money to run your business. In such a competitive
world, you need to serious marketing backing your product.

So, these were one of the biggest mobile app and startup failures that I
find quite interesting. Do you have any other interesting stories that
need to be shared? Hit me up and I'll add it here.

April 19 -- Kumar was in the city recently to unveil STPI incubation
facility.

Any NGO registered as a private limited company with a novel idea that
meets the set criteria can be taken up as a startup.

Interacting exclusively with IANS, he said, "Currently, around 10,000
startups are being supported by us, and these entities have been
instrumental in creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs. In the
long run, they are going to create a very large volume of jobs, he
added.

In Rajasthan, there are around 80-85 startups being supported by his
technology park, he said.

To a question on fear of slowdown and startup failure, he said, "Startup
failure is gradually reducing in India. Startup itself means a new idea
which needs to find acceptance in the market and hence there are chances
of failure and hence comes its name as start-up which means you don't
have hundred per cent chances of success. However, these days, we are
working on an idea to bring in the problem statement from industry, so
that there are less chances of failure and more chances of acceptability
and adaptability, he added.

"We have started doing industry collaborations so startup failure has
reduced. Now, there are Industry and academy partners as well and we are
also providing administrative support to them," said Kumar.

He further said that failure is a part of the startup ecosystem not just
in India but also in the developed part of the world. "Our country has
just embarked on the journey of startups, so naturally failures will be
little more compared to those countries which started it some three
decades back," he said.

In developed countries, the success rate may be more because India has
the first generation of start-ups compared to the US and other such
countries which have third generation of startups. "We are at an
evolving stage of startups", he added.

On the challenges, he said, "Earlier, getting funds was one of the
challenges. However, now since NRIs want to come back to India and
become angel investors, funds are not as much of an issue as it was 20
years back."

Meanwhile, another challenge is the market, so startups are now being
connected with the state govt for ease of business.

Startup ecosystem is now working on networking and it has to be
increased, he suggested further.

Networking can help them to get to market and to find market problems as
well, he added.

Jaipur, April 19 (IANS) Startups in India are contributing towards

Institutions that support incubation not only provide this requisite
support but act as the bridge between startups, incubators, corporate
entities, investor communities, academia, and the government so as to
create the most supportive environment for business nurturing and
growth.

Today, India is the third largest startup ecosystem in the world. Does
that reflect a global leadership position in creating financially viable
business entities? No, not yet. Many young entrepreneurs are fuelling
this passion for startups but more than 90 per cent them in the country
fail, according to a new study by IBM.

This may come as a surprise, especially in the era of Startup India and
Standup India. This study was based on interviews with more than 1,300
Indian executives; including 600 start-up entrepreneurs, 100 venture
capitalists, 100 government leaders, 500 leaders of established
companies and 22 educational institution leaders.

'Startup' is a venture working towards innovation, development or
improvement of products or processes and services, or a scalable
business model with a high potential of employment generation or wealth
creation.

The Government of India launched the Startup India action plan in
February 2016. This embraced a national policy framework for startups
and provided ease of setting up and doing business, promoting foreign
investment, job creation and skill development. Further, under this
plan, the startup can avail various tax benefits. The Finance Act of
2016 provides an exemption of income tax for three years in a block of
seven years from the time of incorporation.

Entrepreneurship needs innovation as much as it does resources, but
perhaps what it needs most of all is access to support functions,
mentorship and resources that would provide new enterprises a
springboard to stability. It is true that there is no dearth of unique
ideas that may solve a problem, target a certain market segment or
create a successful and profitable business, but the journey on that
path is long and arduous.

A helping hand is welcome and often the only means of survival. This is
where the role of incubators comes in. Institutions that support
incubation not only provide this requisite support but act as the bridge
between startups, incubators, corporate entities, investor communities,
academia, and the government so as to create the most supportive
environment for business nurturing and growth.

The role of incubators, while explored to some length in India, has not
yet reached the maturity of international models and 'for-profit'
incubation is an initiative that is still in a nascent stage yet to take
firm root in Indian industry. Business incubation has been globally
recognised as an important tool for job creation and economic
development.

India now has the third-highest number of startup incubators and
accelerators in the world after China and the US, says a report by IT
industry body National Association of Software and Services Companies
(NASSCOM) . With 140 incubators and accelerators, India has inched past
Israel, whose count stands at 130. However, the gap between the top two
is still wide - China and the US have over 2,400 and 1,500 incubators
and accelerators, respectively. Incubators are responsible for providing
support across a startup's life cycle, while accelerators are focused
more towards growth and acceleration of the startup (NASSCOM). The
business incubators offer affordable working spaces, communication and
media resources, mentoring and advisory services. Technology business
incubators, which are mostly associated with universities or corporates
offer access to advance tech laboratories, equipment and libraries. A
vital contribution of business incubators to entrepreneurship lies in
the opportunities they provide to interact and develop relationships
with other entrepreneurs, mentors and other resource persons. Incubators
play the role of an aggregator and bring all the components together to
provide support to start-ups to grow at an accelerated pace and increase
their overall chance of survival.

National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board of
the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India is supporting
Technology Business Incubators (TBI) primarily in and around academic,
technical and management institutions to tap innovations and
technologies for venture creation by utilising expertise and
infrastructure already available with the host institution.
Technology-based new enterprises are high risk and high growth ventures,
and require an enabling environment like TBI to enhance the prospects of
their success. There are different variants of incubators like -
Technology Business Incubators (TBIs); Innovation Hubs; Centers for
Innovation & Entrepreneurship; Virtual Incubators and Seed Accelerators.

The objectives of the technology business Incubators are to nurture
technology-based startups in the following thrust areas: Information &
Communication Technology, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Agriculture and
allied fields, Energy, Water, Services etc.

Gujarat has been a pioneer in building a strong ecosystem for nurturing
innovation and startups in the state that drives economic growth and
large-scale employment opportunities. The government of Gujarat has an
ambitious plan to establish around 100 Incubators and to develop two
million sq ft of "Incubation Space" and support at least 2,000 startups
in the coming years. This will facilitate investment (VC Funding of $ 1
billion for startups by 2021).

As on date over 267 startups/innovations have been supported by 33 nodal
Institutions in Gujarat. There are several startups and scale up success
stories of Innovators incubated from leading Academic Institutions -
IIM- A, IIT -Gandhinagar, MICA, Entrepreneurship Development Institute
of India, Ahmedabad University, NID, GLS University , Gujarat
Technological University, iCREATE, PDPU, Gujarat University etc.

The real-life scenario

Like any other enterprising business teams, the startups go through many
struggles. All of them do not have the expert knowledge in all the
relevant areas. Therefore incubators must evaluate the management
capability of the entrepreneurs and assist in finding the right talent
for these companies. Especially when the entrepreneur is a technologist
lacking business skills, it is critical that the incubator assists the
innovator in finding managers that have the necessary skills to manage a
successful entity and take it to the next level. Two things determine
whether a business can get off the ground successfully and sustainably:
a validated market opportunity with customers willing to pay for an
innovative product or service or process; and a product or service or
process that addresses such an opportunity. The incubators that can
mentor and guide potential startups on the above parameters can ensure
that the startups are not aborted or stunted in their growth.

There is a lot more toincubator success metrics than funding!

Most incubators use funding as a success metric, which is a somewhat
flawed criterion. Over 99 percent of companies should operate as
organically grown, self-sustaining businesses - bootstrapped, without
external financing.

For them, the goal is to achieve customer validation, product, service,
process innovation and not just financing. Yet if the incubator uses
only financing as its success metric, it will persuade inexperienced
entrepreneurs into an unnecessary financing round. And more often than
not, this strategy may fail in the long term.

Mentoring and Networking are the critical skills that will ensure the
success of startups in India.

Of course, where funding is appropriate and relevant, helping
entrepreneurs connect with angel investors and venture capitalists is an
important service. Equally important is to provide insights into what is
and isn't a marketable product or service from a customer's perspective.

Founding a startup is a highly risky venture. The high failure rates
should not be a deterrent for the entrepreneurial spirit. Business
incubators have a long calendar of activities comprising of seminars,
capacity building, investor meets, road shows, network expansion
workshops, demo pitching sessions and business competitions.

As the startup crosses certain milestones they need subsequent funding
to scale up. Incubators syndicate the round of investment through
various agencies including government, corporate and angel investors.

The business incubators have a systematic action plan to ensure
graduation of at least 80 percent of the incubatees to a promising stage
that can attract Venture capital funding and holistic venture success.

The success of the startup is the success of the business incubator -
'responsible business incubation' is the need of the hour!

Agri-tech start-up funding: Ngetich's secret to wooing investors time
and again

Business Daily(Nairobi ANPAK)

March 19, 2023 Sunday

Copyright 2023 Business Daily All Rights Reserved

Length: 788 words

Body

Taita Ngetich, the CEO of Synnefa, an agri-tech startup that provides
farmers with smart sensor-installed greenhouses, has managed to attract
six rounds of funding, raising to the tune of $1.6 million (Sh208
million).What is his secret of survival as many tech start-ups struggle?
"Re-invention, embracing failure, and resilience," he says.

Before Synnefa, an idea that was conceived in a hostel room at the
University of Nairobi (UoN) grew to attract huge funding, Mr Ngetich
went through many hitches.First, he tried his luck in farming in
Oloitotok and the land flooded, washing away his and his friend's
investments.

Then he talked his mother into another business idea--to finance his
dream of building a greenhouse from scratch and installing it on a piece
of land in Kericho.He had saved S0,000 and his mother gave him an
additional Sh100,000. At the end of that season, his neighbours saw his
harvest and asked him to build them similar greenhouses.

Birth of an ideaHe later joined the UoN-based acceleration centre Fablab
where the idea of starting Synnefa was birthed. Synnefa is a Greek word
for cloud.

"Clouds are important to farmers for the rains and the data storage
cloud that Synnefa has built is equally as important," he
says.Read:Synnefa charts a food security path with smart greenhousesTo
raise funds, the textbook model, the Silicon Valley model for start-ups
dictates you get an idea, pitch it to investors and if they like it, you
get funding.

Some techpreneurs get the money, others do not. But Mr Ngetich says
raising funds is not the most important thing in the circulatory system
of tech start-ups.

Refashioned idea"Start-ups are 90 percent failure and 10 percent
success. What we--the brains behind start-ups--don't tell you is that
the build-p is laborious.

It is not as glamorous as we make it appear. You will introduce a
product or a service that looks good on paper but the implementation
becomes problematic.

So, you must refashion your product or service to suit the target as
many times as demand dictates. Boardroom solutions do not at times
reflect the solutions required by your target consumer," he says.

Learning from the processWhen Synnefa started, they had big ideas about
installing greenhouses for farmers targeting the export market.Soon, Mr
Ngetich says, they learned that there was more to farming than just
installing greenhouses: soil health, crop history traceability, and much
more.

"We had to build co-tech hardware and software that went beyond the
solutions of a greenhouse. The hardware is called smart farming
irrigation, which doesn't require on-site supervision.

It is an automated irrigation system that saves the farmer on the cost
of human supervision while creating efficiency and proper management of
water resources.It comes with soil health testing technology that
informs the farmer on the needs of the soil for a better crop and a
better harvest.

It's called FarmCloud, a record-keeping mini-ERP [enterprise resource
planning] solution that is linked to our agronomist for expert analysis
of the crop data," he adds.Re-invent and embrace failureRe-invention, he
says, must be a tentpole that start-ups erect to ensure their initial
ideas do not become obsolete or redundant.

Read:Taita Ngetich - Business Daily Top 40 Under 40The anchor idea has
an affinity to mutate, sometimes even change completely. Looking at ways
these ideas can be enhanced or adjusted to fit reality is key.

Embracing failure and learning from it is another of Mr Ngetich's most
priced secrets."The boldness you have in the ideas you put down in your
proposals should be the same boldness you have in the face of failure.

You must always remember that you can either learn from failure or you
can fold up. Both choices come with their ramifications.

But the mind of a start-up leader should be above giving up," he
says."You must be the cockroach that refuses to die.

The start-up ecosystem is either a place of birth or a deathbed. You
should promise yourself to push limits to the very end," he adds.

Big growthHis business has grown over the years. Mr Ngetich works with a
team of 22 people, 15 of those based in Kenya and seven in India for
software building support.

On how long a start-up should consider itself a start-up, Mr Ngetich has
an interesting way of looking at it."Uber has been a start-up or is
still called a start-up 19 years after it opened shop.

They now have products such as Uber Eats, UberBoda Uber delivery, etc.
Re-invention and resilience.

These new products are smart creations of what the market demanded and
not in their original vision. They are still a start-up because there is
no cutline to how long you should identify as one," he says.

Startup failure: Why do startups fail and how to avoid it

Yourstory.in

April 19, 2018 Thursday 6:30 AM EST

Body

Every year startups fail, even with VC backing and support. But with
each of these failures, we learn something. Most important is to test
your idea before you start up. Often aspiring entrepreneurs are so in
love with their idea that they fail to look at it from a 360-degree
perspective and skip the tough questions they should be asking
themselves.

There are multiple reasons why startups find themselves in the Valley of
Death. A CB Insight report did a post-mortem on 101 startups and found
out 20 reasons for the failure of startups.

If you feel that these reasons touch a chord then you know you are
treading on a thin line and it's time for you to take action to ensure
that your labour of love sees the light at the end of the tunnel. Here
are some reasons that drive startups to fail:

There is no market need

The report found out that almost 42 percent cases failed because they
were solving an interesting problem, but not one which plagued the
market. They didn't resolve an important problem the market was facing.
With Uber and ridesharing, commuting has become easy; Amazon changed the
e-commerce game. Hence, it is important for startups to understand what
the market needs, and if they are really resolving that problem. However
wonderful the idea might be, if it does not address a real pain point in
the right manner, it is doomed to fail.

Run out of cash

This is the second most important reason why startups fail. Almost 29
percent startups claimed that they failed due to fund crunch. This could
be because of multiple reasons - the startup failed to raise funding,
and/or the initial investment that was supposed to last didn't due to
poor planning of resources at one's disposal, or poor allocation of
resources based on the startup's requirement.

"I was blindly consumed by the big picture of how successful my tech
company (Sharingear) would become, and made all the classic
leap-of-faith mistakes first-time entrepreneurs make. Today we parked my
beloved startup in the graveyard of bad ideas. Six months ago, we simply
crashed and burned due to a number of incidents and aspects..." wrote
Mircea Gabriel Eftemie in a post on Medium in 2015. The reasons he cited
were "crash and burn". The company burnt out cash, and was also not able
to find the right market, crashing out.

The team is not right

A good team can make or break a startup. Almost 23 percent startups
claimed that they failed because of the team. In an interview, David
Beaton, the Founder of Sharkius Games, a London-based company, shared
that one of the reasons he had to shut down was because of the lack of a
good team. "Running a team has so much more complexities than a
single-person project. I made mistakes in people management, hiring too
fast, firing too slow. I made mistakes in project management, and on and
on! The inexperience showed at many levels. I was young and
over-confident to the extent I was no longer on Planet Earth. Success
had launched me far into space when I needed to keep my feet firmly on
the ground."

Get outcompeted

If a startup does not know its competition and what they are up against,
then they will eventually find themselves in hot water. 19 percent of
startups told CB Insights that not taking competition seriously led to
their demise.

Cost issues

The CB Insights report says that, "Pricing is a dark art when it comes
to startup success, and startup postmortems highlight the difficulty in
pricing a product high enough to eventually cover costs but low enough
to bring in customers." 18 percent of surveyed startups claimed pricing
and cost issues as the reason for their failure.

Product is not user-friendly

You build a product and realise that it's not something the user enjoys
or wants to use. That's the death knell for your startup. In his book
Alibaba's World, author Porter Erisman - the former VP of Alibaba -
talks about the 'Jack Ma dummy test'. Any new tech product at Alibaba is
first run by Jack Ma, and if he can't (because of his non-tech
background) understand it, then it's a given that no one else will,
especially people with no tech background.

That's how you test your product. If it's not easy for the user to
understand, grasp, or use, then it is not going to be bought or used.
Almost 17 percent of startups shared that this was one of the main
causes for failure.

Product without a business model

A popular Israeli app launcher, EverythingMe, had to close down. Though
the company raised funds and had 15 million downloads, it could not
settle on a working business model, and that's where it failed. Startups
that failed because of the lack of a business model constituted almost
17 percent, out of the 101 startups whose postmortem was done.

Poor marketing

Money does not convert into good marketing. There are a lot of factors
involved in good marketing, including good understanding of the market
and how the product caters to the market. Knowing who your target
audience is is another important factor. 14 percent of startups stated
this as a cause of failure.

Ignore customers

The customer is the centre of the startup universe and 14 percent
startups claimed ignoring this inescapable fact was the cause of
failure. VoterTide told CB Insights, "We didn't spend enough time
talking with customers and were rolling out features that I thought were
great, but we didn't gather enough input from clients. We didn't realize
it until it was too late. It's easy to get tricked into thinking your
thing is cool. You have to pay attention to your customers and adapt to
their needs."

Customer and product are the two things a startup must focus on. The
minute you turn your focus from these, things begin to change.

Product mistimed

Timing is everything. "You could do everything perfectly. You could have
a few paying customers to validate your work. But if the market is not
ready, it doesn't matter. PoliMobile was ahead of the curve. We launched
when mobile was in heavy use with consumers. Some enterprising campaigns
had great success with mobile tools like we offer. Most campaigns today
are still not ready for what we offered in 2011," writes Curt Prins, who
started PoliMobile to provide marketing tools for political campaigns.

Disharmony among team and investors

Another important reason for startup failure is losing focus, and this
could happen due to a number of reasons, from losing focus on the
primary goal to branching out into multiple things so that you lose
sight of the main goal.

Some of the other reasons that are on the list include a pivot gone bad.
Startups often pivot to capture new markets and/or diversify, but the
pivot does not always work out, and almost 10 percent claim this was the
reason for their failure. Then there is the lack of passion, which also
counts for startup failure, and 9 percent of startups attribute their
failure to it.

9 percent of the startups also claimed that expansion to new markets or
new geographical areas didn't materialize and ended up in startup
failure.

According to the report, the other reasons that lead to the failure of a
startup are lack of investor interest, legal challenges, and burn out.

Sustainable funding and the Indian start-up ecosystem

Hindustan Times

December 9, 2022 Friday

Copyright 2022 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 829 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, Dec. 9 -- India saw a staggering jump of 15,400% in the number of
start-ups in just six years, going from 471 in 2016 to 72,993 in 2022.
With more than 100 unicorns, the Indian start-up ecosystem is still
expanding. Despite the advancements made, India's businesses still face
enormous obstacles that must be overcome if India is to become the
world's leading start-up destination.

People beginning their start-up journeys frequently face challenging
decisions, such as leaving their familiar environment and venturing into
uncharted waters. An enterprise cannot be launched with just an idea and
passion for success. A high degree of leadership ability, a clear
understanding of the market, excellent communication skills, and
maturity to see things from the right perspective, along with the
capacity for calculated risk-taking, is required on the part of the
entrepreneur. But the founders still face a lot of difficulties.

The firing of employees by major tech companies like Meta and Twitter
has shocked the entire world, but bad news has also hit the Indian
start-up scene. A growing number of top tech unicorns, valued at over $1
billion each, are laying off staff to save money and concentrate on
profitability amid this year's funding winter. As the world prepares for
yet another recession, Indian start-ups are currently having trouble
raising money. According to a recent report, venture capital funding in
India fell to a 21-month low in the July-September quarter, with just
$2.8 billion raised in 387 deals, as opposed to $9.8 billion raised in
525 deals during the same period last year.

Incubators, science and technology parks and business development
centres are just a few of the support systems that are essential to the
success of start-ups. Failure risk increases when these support systems
are unavailable. India currently has issues with an unorganised and
fragmented market in most sectors. The economy can grow faster if the
infrastructure is built properly and with the start-up ecosystem in
mind.

One of the biggest issues in the Indian start-up ecosystem is a lack of
appropriate mentoring and guidance. The majority of start-ups have
fantastic concepts and products, but they lack the market, business, or
industry experience to bring their goods to consumers. The growth of the
startup ecosystem has largely concentrated in large Tier 1 cities and
states with a strong economy, particularly in IT-enabled industries like
e-commerce, transportation, and finance. Beyond the metro areas, small
businesses are not fully informed of or included in programmes that
offer incentives and tax breaks.

Through its flagship Start-up India initiative, which came into effect
in 2016, the government, for its part, is fostering an environment that
is favourable to entrepreneurs. The government of India is working to
establish ICT infrastructure and offer policy support for improved
e-governance, investments, and technology innovation through research
and higher education to support entrepreneurship and promote economic
growth. India is working to become a knowledge-based and digital economy
with the aid of tech-enabled startups. However, a lot of work still
needs to be done to improve the ease of doing business and to make India
the top choice for fostering small businesses.

The start-up ecosystem needs to create solutions that help companies in
the infrastructure, manufacturing, health care, and education sectors
achieve important national objectives. Even though it may be difficult
for the time being, a funding winter can be beneficial for India's
start-ups. It might put an end to the recent irrational overvaluation of
emerging companies and frenetic over-investing that has been going on.
In addition, the nation's start-ups will have a more ethical, effective,
and sustainable funding process and system with lower hyped valuations
than in the past when the funding winter ends, which may take some time.

The growth of the start-up ecosystem will depend on proactive measures
like improving physical infrastructure, enabling technology adoption for
blended learning/skilling, speeding up policy implementation, and
streamlining the skilling ecosystem. While much has been accomplished,
there is a need to put more emphasis on business accessibility so that
entrepreneurs can concentrate on their core businesses rather than the
bureaucracy that surrounds them. There is also a need for enhancing the
use of VCs, banks, and other domestic financial institutions. Last but
not the least, allowing domestic companies to list abroad, lowering the
burden of compliance with domestic tax, labour laws and corporate laws
will help the start-up ecosystem flourish.

India may be the third largest start-up ecosystem in the world with
respect to the number of start-ups, but it lags behind in churning out
impactful ones. The time has come for it to identify and commodify
high-potential technologies that would drive growth of non-linear
enterprises, according to experts at a Startup Conclave here. This will
help Kerala bolster its own start-up ecosystem, said Saji Gopinath,
Vice-Chancellor, Digital University Kerala, while inaugurating a
conclave organised by the CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary
Science and Technology (NIIST) in association with the Kerala Startup
Mission as part of the 'One Week One Lab' programme.

SVB fallout spreads around the world from London to Singapore

The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is beginning to
spread around the world.  Start-up founders in California's Bay Area are
panicking about access to money and paying employees. Fears of contagion
have reached Canada, India, and China. In the UK, SVB's unit is set to
be declared insolvent, has already ceased trading and is no longer
taking new customers. On Saturday, the leaders of roughly 180 tech
companies sent a letter calling on UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to
intervene. "The loss of deposits has the potential to cripple the sector
and set the ecosystem back 20 years," they said in the letter seen by
Bloomberg.

"Many businesses will be sent into involuntary liquidation overnight."
This is just the beginning. SVB had branches in China, Denmark, Germany,
India, Israel, and Sweden, too. Founders are warning that the bank's
failure could wipe out start-ups around the world without Government
intervention. SVB's joint venture in China, SPD Silicon Valley Bank Co.,
was seeking to calm local clients overnight by reminding them that
operations have been independent and stable. Also read: Silicon Valley
Bank's fall widens systemic cracks as cheap money vanishes "This crisis
will start on Monday and so we call on you to prevent it now," UK
start-up founders and CEOs said in the letter to Hunt. The companies
listed in the letter include Uncapped, Apian, Pockit, and Pivotal
Earth.  Hunt spoke with the Governor of the Bank of England about the
situation on Saturday morning, and the Economic Secretary to the
Treasury was holding a roundtable with affected firms later in the day,
the Treasury said.  Also read: SVB Securities Management exploring
buying firm back Underscoring the challenge governments face in getting
a handle of the full extent of the fallout: The UK Treasury has begun
canvassing start-ups, asking how much they have on deposit, their
approximate cash burn, and their access to banking facilities at SVB and
beyond, two people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be
identified. Treasury declined to comment on the survey.   Founders were
anxiously awaiting the outcome of the roundtable and any information
about how their deposits at the bank would be handled. Toby Mather, CEO
of UK-based education software start-up, Lingumi, has 85% of his
company's cash in SVB. He tried to transfer some of his accounts, but as
of Saturday evening, he wasn't sure whether that worked. "This is life
or death for us," he said. "These things seemed so mundane before." Jack
O'Meara, Founder of the London genomics start-up, Ochre Bio, spent the
weekend trying, unsuccessfully, to move deposits out of SVB. "If there
is no intervention," he said, "it could really wipe out a generation of
entrepreneurial companies." Also read: SVB shutdown sends shockwaves
through Silicon Valley as CEOs race to make payroll As in the US, some
SVB deposits in the UK are insured, but it was unclear when those funds
would be available. A deeper concern among start-up leaders is that the
SVB collapse would throttle future funding from venture capital into the
UK, where businesses are already hobbled by Brexit. Asia's tech leaders
are scrambling to assess the potential ramifications too. In Singapore,
financiers and entrepreneurs at a Wharton alumni gathering in Shangri-La
shared news about the fallout, while start-up founders and investors at
a conference in Mumbai talked about nothing else. Also read: Indian SaaS
and YC-backed start-ups may feel the heat of SVB shutdown "The impact of
the SVB incident on the technology industry should not be
underestimated," analysts led by Liu Zhengning at China International
Capital Corp. said in a note. Deposits are crucial for tech start-ups
because they generally require a lot of cash to pay for hefty
expenditures, including R&D costs and staff salaries, they said. "If
these cash deposits finally have to be impaired in the process of
bankruptcy or restructuring, some tech firms may face high cash flow
tension," they said. "The risks of bankruptcy should not be excluded."
Back in Silicon Valley, US Congressman Ro Khanna from Santa Clara held a
town hall late Friday that was attended by more than 600 people,
including start-up founders, tech leaders, and SVB employees. It went on
for more than 2.5 hours with the primary focus on small businesses
trying to make payroll across the nation come Monday. SVB customers in
California, many of them start-up founders, stood outside of the bank's
branch on Silicon Valley's famed Sand Hill Road in the cold and rain on
Friday, knocking on the locked glass doors and trying to get
representatives of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to answer
their questions.  Also read: SVB chief sold $3.6 million in stock days
before bank's failure A drones start-up founder there said a withdrawal
she made on Thursday hadn't gone through and that she was concerned
about making payroll for her 12 full-time employees. She had tried
calling the FDIC multiple times, "but the number doesn't answer," she
said. Another customer remarked that he should have brought a bottle of
whiskey to pass around as they waited. In trying to get more information
from an FDIC representative, he said, "Put yourself in our shoes." The
representative apologised before closing the glass door once again. Some
in the VC and start-up world are trying to come up with temporary fixes.
Uncapped, a UK fintech start-up that lends to other start-ups, said it's
launching an emergency funding program to help companies meet payroll
and other obligations, as well as longer-term bridge loans to help with
working capital.  Also read: Silicon Valley Bank races to prevent bank
run as Funds advise pulling out cash Alexander Fitzgerald, Founder of
broadband start-up, Cuckoo, and a former Treasury official, noted that
the finances of British start-ups are already stretched due to a
slowdown in the venture capital funding market. "British start-ups need
the Treasury to step in fast," he said.  In Canada, SVB Financial
Group's unit in the country reported $314 million in secured loans last
year, double the $153 million a year earlier, regulatory filings show.
Its customers include e-commerce software provider, Shopify Inc., and
pharmaceutical company, HLS Therapeutics Inc., according to a previous
statement by the bank.  Toronto-based advertising-tech firm, AcuityAds
Holdings Inc., revealed on Saturday it had $55 million in deposits at
SVB, amounting to more than 90% of its cash. The firm had halted trading
of its stock on Friday after a 14% slump, citing the "unfolding
situation" with Silicon Valley Bank.

not just any other name in the global start-up market. It's a venture
that had only a while ago raised $118 million from a bunch of
high-profile investors including Google.

This setback mirrors 2017, when wearables start-up Jawbone, that had
raised $1billion and had a peak valuation of $3billion had closed down.
Experts say start-up shutdowns are becoming increasingly prevalent and
lack of funding no longer holds much weight in this.

Data shows that in Silicon Valley, 10 start-ups that had raised $1.695
billion collectively in venture capital funding had failed in 2017, with
Jawbone being the most prominent example. In India, over 270 start-ups
failed last year including Stayzilla, Yumist, Kaaryah as per Tracxn
data.

"There are multiple reasons why start-ups fail and lack of funding is
just one of them," say experts.

A study by IBM Institute for Business value and Oxford Economics shows
that 90% of Indian start-ups fail, with lack of innovation cited as the
most common reason.

But failure to excel in R&D is again not the chief reason, believe
certain experts, who cite examples of successful Indian start-ups such
as Ola, Flipkart, Gaana.com that carry cloned business models of Uber,
Amazon and Spotify. "Ola and Flipkart have thrived and become unicorns
despite having no clear and distinct innovation in their business and
service models," say experts.

There are a great number of other reasons why start-ups fail, says
investor and techpreneur Nilesh Jain who feels the failure to engage
strongly with investors and mentors is a crucial factor. "It is
important to be involved with investors in the early phase of the
business as investors bring experience, connects and are more capable in
designing effective business plans as compared to budding entrepreneurs
who can then focus on R&D.; Start-ups should not shy away from engaging
investors in their plans and should not be afraid to seek help."

Another big reason for start-up failure is poor financial management.
Jain says many start-ups with great products and vision have failed due
to mismanagement of funds, as they focused more on product promotion
than on product development, consumer needs and competition assessment.
"It is imperative for the founder(s) to plan and execute activities that
provide long-term gains. The two most important things that founders
need are product and team. It is the reason customers love you and
ultimately why people come to work."

Overconfidence in customer acquisition is another key reason for
failures. Arunprasad Durairaj, CEO and co-founder, Flinto Learning
Solutions, says often founders assume their product/service will become
a hit the moment it launches. "The first few customers might show
interest, but eventually the process of attracting customers becomes an
expensive task. "

Furthermore, product-market fit, growth challenges based on product
need, pricing are other common reasons, believe experts, for start-up
failures, as not finding the right product-market fit before the funds
dry up can cause shutdowns in the start-up world.

Start-up failure should be perceived in the right manner. Hitesh Ahuja,
founder and CEO of Yumlane says start-up failure indicates there is room
for risk-taking, which is being encouraged by the system.

To curb chances of failure, entrepreneurs need to be agile, advise
experts. Harsh Dhand, CEO of RentSher, says agility in both pivoting, as
well as business models, can help in periods where the start-up has to
sustain on low funds. "We realised that the peer-to-peer model is good
on paper but takes a lot of funds to execute at scale. The asset led
model in rentals gives short-term profits but is costly in the long
term. After a couple of pivots, we finally selected a more scalable
model around events, electronics and equipment rentals as a
marketplace."

SVB fallout spreads around the world from London to Singapore

The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is beginning to
spread around the world.  Start-up founders in California's Bay Area are
panicking about access to money and paying employees. Fears of contagion
have reached Canada, India, and China. In the UK, SVB's unit is set to
be declared insolvent, has already ceased trading and is no longer
taking new customers. On Saturday, the leaders of roughly 180 tech
companies sent a letter calling on UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to
intervene. "The loss of deposits has the potential to cripple the sector
and set the ecosystem back 20 years," they said in the letter seen by
Bloomberg.

"Many businesses will be sent into involuntary liquidation overnight."
This is just the beginning. SVB had branches in China, Denmark, Germany,
India, Israel, and Sweden, too. Founders are warning that the bank's
failure could wipe out start-ups around the world without Government
intervention. SVB's joint venture in China, SPD Silicon Valley Bank Co.,
was seeking to calm local clients overnight by reminding them that
operations have been independent and stable. Also read: Silicon Valley
Bank's fall widens systemic cracks as cheap money vanishes "This crisis
will start on Monday and so we call on you to prevent it now," UK
start-up founders and CEOs said in the letter to Hunt. The companies
listed in the letter include Uncapped, Apian, Pockit, and Pivotal
Earth.  Hunt spoke with the Governor of the Bank of England about the
situation on Saturday morning, and the Economic Secretary to the
Treasury was holding a roundtable with affected firms later in the day,
the Treasury said.  Also read: SVB Securities Management exploring

beyond, two people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be
identified. Treasury declined to comment on the survey.   Founders were
anxiously awaiting the outcome of the roundtable and any information
about how their deposits at the bank would be handled. Toby Mather, CEO
of UK-based education software start-up, Lingumi, has 85% of his
company's cash in SVB. He tried to transfer some of his accounts, but as
of Saturday evening, he wasn't sure whether that worked. "This is life
or death for us," he said. "These things seemed so mundane before." Jack
O'Meara, Founder of the London genomics start-up, Ochre Bio, spent the
weekend trying, unsuccessfully, to move deposits out of SVB. "If there
is no intervention," he said, "it could really wipe out a generation of
entrepreneurial companies." Also read: SVB shutdown sends shockwaves

UK, where businesses are already hobbled by Brexit. Asia's tech leaders
are scrambling to assess the potential ramifications too. In Singapore,
financiers and entrepreneurs at a Wharton alumni gathering in Shangri-La
shared news about the fallout, while start-up founders and investors at
a conference in Mumbai talked about nothing else. Also read: Indian SaaS

because they generally require a lot of cash to pay for hefty
expenditures, including R&D costs and staff salaries, they said. "If
these cash deposits finally have to be impaired in the process of
bankruptcy or restructuring, some tech firms may face high cash flow
tension," they said. "The risks of bankruptcy should not be excluded."
Back in Silicon Valley, US Congressman Ro Khanna from Santa Clara held a
town hall late Friday that was attended by more than 600 people,
including start-up founders, tech leaders, and SVB employees. It went on
for more than 2.5 hours with the primary focus on small businesses
trying to make payroll across the nation come Monday. SVB customers in
California, many of them start-up founders, stood outside of the bank's
branch on Silicon Valley's famed Sand Hill Road in the cold and rain on
Friday, knocking on the locked glass doors and trying to get
representatives of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to answer
their questions.  Also read: SVB chief sold $3.6 million in stock days
before bank's failure A drones start-up founder there said a withdrawal
she made on Thursday hadn't gone through and that she was concerned
about making payroll for her 12 full-time employees. She had tried
calling the FDIC multiple times, "but the number doesn't answer," she
said. Another customer remarked that he should have brought a bottle of
whiskey to pass around as they waited. In trying to get more information
from an FDIC representative, he said, "Put yourself in our shoes." The
representative apologised before closing the glass door once again. Some
in the VC and start-up world are trying to come up with temporary fixes.

the Treasury to step in fast," he said.  In Canada, SVB Financial

year, double the $153 million a year earlier, regulatory filings show.
Its customers include e-commerce software provider, Shopify Inc., and

Certain people used BSNL as 'cash cow' during UPA rule: Ashwini
Vaishnaw; When Congress MP Jasbir Singh Gill asked about "theft of data
''from BSNL connections, the Communications Minister said data was much
costlier during UPA's time.

When Congress MP Jasbir Singh Gill asked about "theft of data ''from
BSNL connections, the Communications Minister said data was much
costlier during UPA's time.

The Question Hour in Lok Sabha continued to be politically volatile, as
Commerce and Industry Minister Piysuh Goyal slammed the Congress-led UPA
government for what he called its failure in taking measures to promote
start-ups and unicorns and Communications Minister Ashwani Vaishnaw
accused them of "diverting funds from BSNL", amid loud protests from
Congress and other Opposition MPs.

"Those times have gone when certain (former) ministers, people sitting
on the other side of the aisle, used BSNL as a cash cow," Vaishnaw said,
pointing towards the Opposition benches, even as Opposition members rose
in protest.

The blame game began when Congress leader Manish Tewari asked Goyal
about steps the government has taken to help start-ups graduate to the
unicorn grade.

Tewari pointed out that India does not figure in the start-ups ranking
and said: "Obviously there is still a long road to travel. What exactly
is the government doing to ensure that our start-ups, which are
deserving, can actually be financed to an extent where they can graduate
to the unicorn grade as quickly as possible?"

Asserting that the start-up schemes started only in 2016, Goyal said,
"You should look deeply at what and when the UPA did something for
start-ups or unicorns. The party (Congress) was in power for so many
years; why did you not begin work on the start-up scheme and promote
them? You had left that work for (Narendra) Modi-ji..."

He added, "Start-ups are prone to failures is a very high probability,
though I must say (their) success rate in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world..."

Tewari and other Congress MPs stood up and protested that Goyal did not
reply to the question, but tried to politicise the issue, as BJP benches
backed him by thumping desks.

The Start-up India Seed Fund Scheme has been approved for four years
starting from 2021-22 and is being implemented with a corpus of Rs 945
crore. It is aimed at providing financial assistance to start-ups for
proof of concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry
and commercialisation.

Similar scenes were repeated when BJP member G M Siddeshwara asked why
BSNL services continued to be poor in both rural and urban areas.
Vaishnaw said, "BSNL went through a very bad phase of its life,
primarily because of certain political parties, especially during the
UPA government, when a lot of funds from BSNL were diverted..." But, he
added the Modi government has approved a "very large package of Rs
1,64,000 crore" for BSNL's revival.

Congress MPs protested and Tewari asked the minister to "substantiate"
his statement, but Vaishnaw went on explaining how the package will
"totally transform BSNL".

When Congress MP Jasbir Singh Gill asked about "theft of data "from BSNL
connections, Vaishnaw said data was much costlier during UPA's time.

ANALYSIS: Airline start-ups and failures 2018; A round-up of 2018's
start-up carriers and those airlines that suspended, ceased operations
or entered formal restructuring during the year

A round-up of 2018's start-up carriers and those airlines that
suspended, ceased operations or entered formal restructuring during the
year

This year began with a number of new players optimistic of making their
mark in the airline sector. But, against a backdrop of rising fuel
costs, the second half of 2018 was to prove challenging. And by the time
oil prices eased, the damage for many was done and a number of carriers
had been forced to halt flights.

While there was no repeat of the big-name casualties of 2017, and most
of the failed operators were small or new players – including several
that launched and collapsed or scaled back their scheduled ambitions
within the year – there were still several high-profile groundings.

EUROPE

In Europe, there were several insolvencies as higher fuel prices took a
toll in the tougher winter months.

The year began with airlines jockeying for the space vacated by Air
Berlin and its Austrian unit Niki, in some cases using the assets of
those carriers.

At the start of the year, EasyJet started operating at Berlin Tegel,
where it was joined in the summer season by Laudamotion – established
from the assets of Niki by that carrier's founder, Niki Lauda. Ryanair
later acquired a 75% stake in the unit

Despite boosting its presence in leisure markets from Austria and
Germany, Laudamotion is forecast by Ryanair to lose money this year and
not reach breakeven until its third year of operations.

IAG, which had also been in the running to acquire Niki, in July
established a new Austrian-based low-cost carrier under its Level brand.
IAG also moved Level into Paris Orly, taking over the air operator's
certificate of long-haul premium unit OpenSkies. The last flights under
that brand took place in September.

While not a new name or carrier, Meridiana relaunched in February under
the old Air Italy name. The revamp follows Qatar Airways' 49% investment
in the airline.

Air Nostrum's owners outlined plans to create a new carrier in Ireland
called Hibernian Airlines, which will specialise in European wet-lease
operations. The Spanish carrier, which in July announced a tie-up with
CityJet, has been aiming to have the new airline operational by
year-end.

Ukrainian budget carrier SkyUp began operations in May, with services to
resorts in Egypt. Having launched with a pair of 737-800s, SkyUp has
also reached a deal with Boeing to take up to 10 737 Max jets.

Romanian operator Just Us Air added an A321 shortly after launching in
April with an A319.

Air Albania's creation was cleared by the national competition authority
at the end of September. The regulator was notified of plans for Air
Albania by Albcontrol, a state company that manages national airspace
and will own 10% of the carrier. Turkish Airlines is to hold 49% and MDN
Investment 41%.

Georgian carrier Myway Airlines and Air Belgium each launched during
2018, though both have scaled back their scheduled operations over the
winter. Myway suspended all but one of its scheduled services as the
Georgian carrier dealt with a number of number of issues, including
renewed tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

Air Belgium launched flights in June, initially operating Airbus A340
services from Brussels Charleroi to Hong Kong. It pulled this service at
the end October, however, citing a contractual dispute with a commercial
partner, and is focusing for now on wet-lease services. It recently
reportedly secured fresh financing from Belgium-based investment fund
Sogepa.

Another Belgian operator, the relaunched VLM, had been revived by SHS
Aviation in 2017. But its re-emergence proved short-lived as it was
placed into liquidation in September.

Russian carrier Saratov Airlines was grounded at the end of May, just
months before a newly developed airport for its home city was due to
open. That came less than four months after a fatal accident involving
one of Saratov's Antonov An-148s. One of its shareholders, Russian
entrepreneur Arkady Evstafiev, began work on a successor carrier –
although the project has yet to formally emerge.

Come the winter, Cobalt, Primera, PrivatAir and Small Planet Airlines
were all among carriers forced to halt flights.

Lithuania's civil aviation authority suspended the operating licence of
restructuring leisure carrier Small Planet Airlines in late November.
The carrier had begun a formal restructuring, which it said had become
necessary to protect it from the "negative impact" of the financial
fallout from its Polish and German sister companies. Both of these units
had earlier filed for restructuring

Cypriot carrier Cobalt Air suspended operations in October, having
emerged just two years ago as one of several start-ups in the wake of
flag carrier Cyprus Airways' collapse in 2015.

Swiss premium charter specialist PrivatAir filed for insolvency, along
with its German subsidiary, in November. PrivatAir stated that a number
of events had had a "significant impact" on the companies' future
business forecast and viability.

PrivatAir, which was established more than 40 years ago, specialised in
all-business transport using aircraft such as Boeing 737s and A319s
configured with premium cabin layouts. It also operated long-haul types
such as the 767 and was a customer for the 787.

The highest-profile of the European airline failures during 2018 was
Primera. The leisure carrier had taken its first steps in the long-haul,
low-cost segment – and had just rolled out ambitious plans to spread its
presence to points across mainland Europe – when it was forced to halt
flights after planned investment failed to materialise. That it should
collapse a year to the day after Monarch Airlines merely underscored the
challenges that European winters can hold for struggling operators.

NORTH AMERICA

JetBlue and Azul founder David Neeleman cemented his plans for a new US
start-up by striking a tentative deal at July's Farnborough air show for
60 A220-300s.

With his launching of JetBlue in 2002, Neeleman had been responsible for
one of the last major new US entrants, and his plans for a new carrier
dominated headlines when they first emerged in June.

While initial reports suggested that the airline would be called Moxy,
Neeleman said this was just a working name. The carrier is aiming to
launch in 2021.

Elsewhere in the USA, Great Lakes Airlines – a turboprop operator with a
network that connected cities in western USA – suspended all scheduled
flights on 26 March. The company has long said that a 2013 pilot hiring
rule created a shortage of flightcrew that particularly impacted small
regional airlines.

A new regional operator launched in November when California Pacific
Airlines began services from the McClellan-Palomar airport near
Carlsbad, California, operating to San Jose and Reno using a 50-seat
Embraer ERJ-145.

Across the border in Canada, WestJet's ultra-discount unit Swoop began
operations in June and quickly expanded into cross-border flights. Swoop
added US flights in October and plans to start services to Mexico and
the Caribbean in early 2019.

A number of new players have emerged in the Canadian low-cost market.
Flair Airlines launched last summer, and Jetlines is aiming to launch
next year. In September, Jetlines promoted Javier Suarez to chief
executive, its third leadership change in the past two years. "The
market will be super-stimulated as soon as low fares get into the
market," says Suarez. "Things are going well for us to get the [AOC] by
May 2019."

ASIA-PACIFIC

High-profile Vietnam start-up carrier Bamboo Airways spent much of the
year eyeing the launch of operations.

The carrier had planned to start services on 10 October, but this date
passed without a launch, apparently owing to hold-ups with its AOC. It
is now targeting a 29 December start, parent FLC Group said in a
statement related to an agreement between it and state-owned companies
under the Petrolimex banner.

The statement adds that Bamboo will start operations with 10 aircraft,
growing to 20 in the first quarter of 2019. Bamboo Airways received its
air transport business licence in early November, but still needs an AOC
before launching services. The ambitious start-up also signed letters of
intent to take 20 787-9s and 24 A321neos.

Air Astana aims to launch its new low-cost unit FlyArystan in the first
half of 2019, operating from multiple bases in Kazakhstan with a view to
reaching a fleet of at least 15 aircraft by 2022.

Planned start-up Starlux Airlines in May received a permit from
Taiwanese regulators for its establishment. It was aiming to complete
the licensing work by the end of this year with a view to launching in
early 2020. The airline is leasing 10 A321neos from the end of 2019.
Starlux also committed to taking 17 A350s, including the -1000 variant,
giving it a fleet of 27 aircraft in 2024.

Chinese start-up carrier Genghis Khan Airlines placed an order for 25
Comac ARJ21-700 aircraft in August. Genghis Khan was rebranded from
Tianjiao Airlines, which had been granted preliminary approval in
February by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

Cambodian start-up KC International Airlines received its first aircraft
at the end of June, an A320. The carrier was established in Phnom Penh
with $100 million in launch capital as a joint venture between Cambodian
and Chinese investors. It secured its AOC in August.

Maldivian start-up Manta Air is taking a pair of new ATR 72-600s from
European regional aircraft lessor Nordic Aviation Capital. Based at
Velana International airport in Male, the aircraft will be used to serve
Kudahuvadhoo, Dharavandhoo and Thimarafushi, respectively located in the
Dhaalu, Baa and Thaa atolls. Another carrier in the region, Mega
Maldives Airlines, had suspended operations in summer 2017.

Indian carrier Star Air had been aiming to start operations in September
but is still to launch. The airline has been due to operate a pair of
ERJ-145s on domestic routes operating under India's regional
connectivity scheme from its base at Bengaluru's Kempegowda
International airport.

South Korean start-up Air Pohang began services on 7 February using two
Bombardier CRJ200s, but it suspended operations at the start of
December, with a view to restarting services in early 2019 with A319s.

Similarly, the resumption of services by Air Mandalay proved
short-lived. The airline resumed services early in 2018 after several
months on the ground. But the operator was forced to suspend operations
again in early September amid reports of a further restructuring.

Regional carrier JetGo Australia suspended its scheduled services after
entering voluntary administration on 1 June.

Elsewhere, Indonesia AirAsia X will cease scheduled operations in
January 2019 and operate as a non-scheduled commercial airline
thereafter. The carrier's only scheduled operation – a
seven-times-weekly service between Denpasar and Tokyo Narita using an
A330 – will be suspended in January,

LATIN AMERICA

Avianca Brazil became the biggest carrier of the year to run into formal
troubles, when it filed for the Brazilian equivalent of bankruptcy in
December. The carrier, which is owned by Synergy Group but is a separate
company in all but name from Colombia's Avianca, sought court protection
following an unsuccessful effort to renegotiate aircraft leases with
lessors.

Aircastle was among lessors that moved to repossess at least 13 aircraft
on 10 December – representing around one-quarter of its fleet. The
carrier is continuing to operate flights.

Conditions have become more challenging in the region, notably amid weak
local currencies against the strong US dollar.

Argentina, which has seen a string of start-ups of late amid the
liberalisation of the country's aviation market, is another market that
has been affected.

Regional airline LASA, which only began operations at the start of
November, within a month "suspended temporarily" all flights as it tries
to find investment. The Neuquen-based ERJ-145 operator cited currency
issues, rising fuel costs, the recent abolition of the minimum air fares
and low load factors for forcing the move.

Ironically, minimum air fares ruled were removed in part to help fuel
low-fare travel in the country. The likes of Flybondi, which launched
flights in January, Norwegian's new Argentinian unit that followed in
October, had been pressing for the rule change.

Flybondi, which operates 737s out of Buenos Aires' new El Palomar
low-cost airport, in December launched its first international services
flying to Asuncion in Paraguay and Punta del Este in Uruguay.

Argentinian regional carrier Flyest also began scheduled flights in
October, while Jetsmart is planning to start domestic Argentinian
flights in 2019 after reportedly acquiring Cordoba-based start-up
airline Alas del Sur Lineas Aereas during the summer.

Grounded Venezuelan carrier Aserca Airlines at the end of May
acknowledged that it was unable to resume operations and requested that
Venezuela's civil aviation authority INAC cancel its AOC. Aserca is the
third and last of the airlines owned by Venezuelan businessman Simeon
Garcia that have gone out of business in months. His Dominican
Republic-based PAWA and Caracas-based Santa Barbara Airlines had gone
into liquidation earlier this year.

But another Venezuelan carrier Aeropostal resumed commercial flights
with flights to Havana in August, after it was grounded for almost a
year. Aeropostal resumed service with a single Boeing MD-82 from its
fleet of eight, which had been grounded as a result of the economic
crisis in the country.

AFRICA

Nigerian government efforts to establish a new flag carrier for the
African state airline foundered just weeks after a high-profile launch.

Transport minister Hadi Sirika had unveiled details of the airline,
Nigeria Air, during an event at the Farnborough air show in July. But in
September, Sirika disclosed, via his social media feed, that the
Nigerian cabinet, the federal executive council, has "taken the tough
decision to suspend the national carrier project".

He did not specify reasons for the suspension and later hinted that the
project was still in play, and was quoted as saying that it would be
activated as soon as possible. But as the year closed, there was no firm
date for its launch.

But another Nigerian start-up burst onto the scene at the end of the
year, when Green Africa struck a tentative deal for up to 100 Boeing 737
Max 8 jets. Based in Lagos, Green Africa recently received its air
transport license and is in the process of obtaining an air operator's
certificate. It plans to operate within Nigeria, and has intentions to
build a pan-Africa network.

SA Express has slowly been resuming services since South African
regulators in July reinstated its AOC. The carrier was temporarily
grounded in May when its operating licences and the certificates of
airworthiness for nine of its 21 aircraft were suspended following a
safety audit.

Former chief Siza Mzimela has returned to manage the airline on an
acting basis. While services have resumed, SA Express faces financial
concerns and has required a further bail-out from the South African
government

Air Senegal began its first flights in May, launching with a domestic
service between Dakar and Ziguinchor. The carrier, which added
international flights in October, operates ATR 72-600s and A319s, and
has a pair of A330neos on order.

Chad's new Ethiopian Airlines-backed flag carrier began domestic
operations in October. Ethiopian has a 49% stake in the joint venture,
named Tchadia Airlines. The balance is held by Chad's government.

It is one of several African joint-venture carriers in which Ethiopian
has invested. Zambia Airways, in which Ethiopian holds a 45% share, is
planning to begin flights early next year, while the carrier has sealed
an agreement with the Ghanaian government to develop a new national
carrier for the country.

MIDDLE EAST

Kuwaiti carrier Wataniya Airways suspended operations in September, days
after receiving a grounding threat from the country’s regulator. The
airline had been struggling to deal with cancellations and flight
disruption.

Wataniya emerged with the same name, but a different operating model, to
a predecessor airline which collapsed in 2011. The carrier had appeared
to be embarking on a fleet-renewal programme, after Golden Falcon
Aviation unveiled an agreement to take 25 Airbus A320neos for Wataniya
during the Farnborough air show.

Royal Jordanian ended services of its charter operation Royal Wings at
the end of November, citing losses incurred by the unit, although talks
are being held with potential buyers of the airline.

Plans are under way for a new Aqaba-based airline to launch next spring,
as part of continued efforts to develop tourism in the Jordanian city.

Boeing 737 order.

with flights to Havana in August, after it was grounded for almost a
year. Aeropostal resumed service with a single Boeing MD-82 from its
fleet of eight, which had been grounded as a result of the economic
crisis in the country.

AFRICA

Nigerian government efforts to establish a new flag carrier for the
African state airline foundered just weeks after a high-profile launch.

Transport minister Hadi Sirika had unveiled details of the airline,
Nigeria Air, during an event at the Farnborough air show in July. But in
September, Sirika disclosed, via his social media feed, that the
Nigerian cabinet, the federal executive council, has "taken the tough
decision to suspend the national carrier project".

He did not specify reasons for the suspension and later hinted that the
project was still in play, and was quoted as saying that it would be
activated as soon as possible. But as the year closed, there was no firm
date for its launch.

But another Nigerian start-up burst onto the scene at the end of the
year, when Green Africa struck a tentative deal for up to 100 Boeing 737
Max 8 jets. Based in Lagos, Green Africa recently received its air
transport license and is in the process of obtaining an air operator's
certificate. It plans to operate within Nigeria, and has intentions to
build a pan-Africa network.

SA Express has slowly been resuming services since South African
regulators in July reinstated its AOC. The carrier was temporarily
grounded in May when its operating licences and the certificates of
airworthiness for nine of its 21 aircraft were suspended following a
safety audit.

Former chief Siza Mzimela has returned to manage the airline on an
acting basis. While services have resumed, SA Express faces financial
concerns and has required a further bail-out from the South African
government

Air Senegal began its first flights in May, launching with a domestic
service between Dakar and Ziguinchor. The carrier, which added
international flights in October, operates ATR 72-600s and A319s, and
has a pair of A330neos on order.

Chad's new Ethiopian Airlines-backed flag carrier began domestic
operations in October. Ethiopian has a 49% stake in the joint venture,
named Tchadia Airlines. The balance is held by Chad's government.

It is one of several African joint-venture carriers in which Ethiopian
has invested. Zambia Airways, in which Ethiopian holds a 45% share, is
planning to begin flights early next year, while the carrier has sealed
an agreement with the Ghanaian government to develop a new national
carrier for the country.

MIDDLE EAST

Kuwaiti carrier Wataniya Airways suspended operations in September, days
after receiving a grounding threat from the country’s regulator. The
airline had been struggling to deal with cancellations and flight
disruption.

Wataniya emerged with the same name, but a different operating model, to
a predecessor airline which collapsed in 2011. The carrier had appeared
to be embarking on a fleet-renewal programme, after Golden Falcon
Aviation unveiled an agreement to take 25 Airbus A320neos for Wataniya
during the Farnborough air show.

Royal Jordanian ended services of its charter operation Royal Wings at
the end of November, citing losses incurred by the unit, although talks
are being held with potential buyers of the airline.

Plans are under way for a new Aqaba-based airline to launch next spring,
as part of continued efforts to develop tourism in the Jordanian city.

Amid funding winter, Indian tech industry begins to feel heat of Silicon
Valley Bank collapse; The tech industry is the biggest customer of the

especially in the SaaS (software as a service) sector that service US
clients, having accounts at the bank.

The tech industry is the biggest customer of the Silicon Valley Bank
(SVB), with a large number of Indian start-ups, especially in the SaaS
(software as a service) sector that service US clients, having accounts
at the bank.

Late Friday night, it was a long wait for several Indian start-up
founders who had accounts at the troubled Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and
had a lot more than $250,000 parked there. That is more than what US
regulators - who shut the bank down - said would be insured by them,
with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) asking companies
with accounts containing more than $250,000 to contact a toll-free
number.

Panic had set in. The tech industry is the biggest customer of SVB with
a large number of Indian start-ups, especially in the SaaS (software as
a service) sector that services US clients, having accounts at the bank.

"It is 4 am now and we have been on hold at the toll-free number given
by the FDIC for over half an hour. We have around $2 million in our SVB
account and need that to create payroll," a founder told The Indian
Express early Saturday morning.

As of December 2022, SVB had $209 billion in total assets and about $175
billion in total deposits. In a press release, FDIC said that depositors
will have access to their insured deposits - capped at $250,000 - by
Monday (March 13). However, data submitted to the FDIC by the bank at
the end of 2022 showed that 89 per cent of its $175 billion in deposits
were uninsured. The bank's crisis set off a turmoil in global markets,
including in India.

Depositors with funds exceeding insurance caps will get receivership
certificates for their uninsured balances, meaning businesses with big
deposits stuck in the bank are unlikely to get their money out soon.
This is where the real problem lies.

For, aside from being a banking partner, SVB had also been an important
lender to several Indian start-ups when the sector in India was starting
to take shape around 2010-11. Among its most notable bets was an
investment of a total of $1.7 million in One97 Communications, the
parent company of Paytm, which it later sold. Other start-ups that had
received funding from SVB include Bluestone and Carwale.

While the impact of SVB's failure on Indian start-ups will only start
becoming clear from Monday, many founders said that not being able to
take out more than $250,000 from their accounts will hit them hard.

Amid a funding winter, where availability of funds for start-ups is
dwindling, this could prove to be a major roadblock, especially to young
businesses.

"We might face issues with even preparing payrolls for our employees if
this persists for more than a few weeks," said a founder with more than
$250,000 in the bank.

In a poll run on the WhatsApp group of Indian founders whose start-ups
were incubated by the US-based technology start-up accelerator
YCombinator (YC), a majority of the founders said they had more than
$250,000 with SVB, with some having parked more than $1 million in their
SVB accounts. SVB was also a preferred personal banker for several ultra
high net-worth individuals in the technology space.

On Saturday, people from several venture capital firms including Accel,
B Capital, Ribbit Capital, and Lightspeed Venture met to discuss the
aftermath of SVB's failure which they called "deeply disappointing and
concerning".

In a joint statement, they said that in the event that SVB were to be
purchased and appropriately capitalised, "we would be strongly
supportive and encourage our portfolio companies to resume their banking
relationship with them".

Crisis at the bank began after it sold substantially all of its
available-for-sale securities at a $1.8-billion loss, mostly in the form
of US Treasury securities.

SVB had received a massive volume of deposits during the 2020-2021 tech
boom and invested the proceeds into long-term Treasury bonds while
interest rates were low. However, with interest rates rising in the US,
the market value of these Treasuries became substantially lower than SVB
paid, triggering withdrawal requests from depositors.

While the bank's 52-week high was just shy of $600 per share, it was
trading for less than $40 in Friday's premarket session.

A founder explained that SVB had traditionally been the default banking
partner for most start-ups because of its legacy in technology and
experience of banking high-growth and high-burn companies.

Basically, it dealt with businesses that traditional banks typically
stay away from given the perceived risk of failure and lent to start-ups
when other sources of funding were hard to come by. "I'd say until a few
years ago, it was only SVB; only today have start-ups started to get
other funding options," the person quoted above added.

Kunal Bahl, founder of e-commerce site Snapdeal, said that in the early
days of the start-up, when it was faced with a cash crunch, SVB had
extended a small debt to the firm to keep it afloat. "In 2012, in the
midst of pivoting our business model from online coupons to e-commerce,
we found ourselves in a cash crunch as investors weren't convinced we
could pull it off. Silicon Valley Bank extended a small debt line to us
that kept us going," Bahl said on Twitter.

SVB offered an easy way for start-ups in India to park their cash as
firms could set up their bank accounts without needing a United States
Social Security Number or Income Tax Identification Number. Besides, as
a founder explained, SVB has a very strong network of lawyers and
accountants in the USA who, for a fee, actively recommend the bank to
high growth start-ups.

Jhunjhunwala portfolio stock falls to hit all-time low on SVB exposure

Body

New Delhi, March 13 -- Shares of Nazara Technologies Ltd, mobile gaming
company, plunged to hit low of Rs.483 apiece on the BSE in Monday's
trading session on worries of having exposure to the Silicon Valley Bank
(SVB). Two of its step-down subsidiaries hold cash balances of around
Rs.64 crore at the SVB.

Nazara Technologies, in a regulatory filing, said both subsidiaries -
Kiddopia Inc and Mediawrkz - continue to be well capitalised and are
generating positive cash flows along with profitability. Hence, Nazara
Technologies said, it expects no impact on its day-to-day operations,
business performance and growth plans due to the SVB event.

It further asserted that Nazara Group (Nazara Technologies Limited and
its subsidiaries) continues to maintain healthy reserves of cash and
cash equivalents in excess of Rs.600 crore excluding the SVB-impacted
funds.

As per the recent shareholding pattern on the BSE, Indian investor Rekha
Jhunjhunwala holds 65,88,620 shares that constitutes to 10% stake in the
tech company as of December 2022. Nazara Tech shares made stock market
debut in April 2021 and have fallen more than 39% since listing.

India's state minister for technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Twitter
said that he will meet start-ups this week to assess the impact on them
of Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) collapse, as concerns rise about the
fallout for the Indian start-up sector.

SVB's failure has roiled global markets as California banking regulators
shut down the bank on Friday after a run on the lender, which had $209
billion in assets at the end of 2022, with depositors pulling out as
much as $42 billion on a single day, rendering it insolvent.

A selection of the five best books in a year of start-ups and unicorns

Business Standard

December 25, 2021 Saturday 12:38 AM GMT

Copyright 2021 Business Standard Private Limited All Rights Reserved

Length: 858 words

Earlier this year, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway invested $500
million in a Brazilian fintech start-up called Nubank. This development
is noteworthy because Warren Buffett seldom invests in start-ups,
preferring to stick to his "circle of competence". Back in 2018, his
company had surprised the business community when it had placed a rare
bet in start-ups by investing $300 million in India's Paytm. Paytm was
listed last month and Nubank this month. As several other start-ups
queue up for IPOs, and record amounts of dollars flow into this
alternative investment space, one observes that the start-up activity
has truly turned mainstream. Entrepreneurship has become a popular
option for wealth creation.

Heroes and hustlers, celebrities and nerds, all have been drawn to this
century's gold rush and the excitement is palpable. Whether the
start-ups meet with unicorn endings or simply get slammed against the
hard wall of brutal commerce, one thing is certain - these businesses
have brought in their pickaxes to disrupt the status quo. As a
consequence, the tech and innovation landscape is changing rapidly. A
new cast of characters is taking centre-stage and neologisms and
portmanteau phrases such as decacorns, aquihires, and blitzscaling have
now seeped into current business lingo.

Looking back at 2021, we take note of the top start-up-related books
published this year that shed new light on this space. They range from
memoirs to self-help manuals and serve as readable guides not just for
entrepreneurs but for anyone with an interest in this domain.

Masters of Scale

This book is written by Reid Hoff­man, along with June Cohen and Deron
Triff. Hoffman, as you may be aware, is the founder of LinkedIn and an
investor at Greylock Partners. This book is based on the popular podcast
that he hosts. He has previously authored books such as The All­iance,
The Start-up of You and Blitzscaling.

In his current book, he has drawn on his conversations with successful
business leaders and distilled key insights into ten themes - "Do Things
That Don't Scale", "Learn to Unlearn", "Watch What They Do, Not What
They Say" feature among these themes. Leveraging entertaining anecdotes
and insightful takeaways (served up as Reid's theories and Reid's
analysis), this book offers sound counsel to the reader who is seeking
to take his start-up "from zero to a gazillion".

The Fail-Safe Startup

With this book, Harvard Business School professor Tom Eisenmann has
attempted to answer questions such as why do start-ups fail and what
aspiring entrepreneurs can learn from these failures. Drawing on
experience, interviews, surveys and case studies, the author casts aside
conventional wisdom and uncovers various factors contributing to
start-up failure.

Eisenmann argues that blaming the horse (opportunity) or jockey
(founder) for a venture's failure is a simplistic approach. Utilising
profiles of multiple unsuccessful start-ups such as Quincy, Triangulate,
Fab, and Better Place, the author identifies six failure patterns that
typically sink ventures.

The Ventilator Project

The Ventilator Project was for­m­ed in response to Prime Minister Modi's
call to develop indigenous solutions to battle against Covid-19. The
IIT-Kanpur team including a start-up called Nocca Rob­otics took on the
ambitious task of building a high-quality ICU grade ventilator in a
short span of time and delivered on its objective.

Project leads Srikant Sastri and Amitabha Bandyopadhyay have documented
the team's "race against time", and the outcome is an inspiring story
that showcases human grit and innovative spirit in the face of
adversity.

The Biography of a Failed Venture

There is much to be gained from reading this original memoir written by
Prashant Desai. Rising from humble beginnings, the author attempts to
convert Rs 20 crore into Rs 2,000 crore in 10 years by building a truly
Indian sports brand. But the effort goes belly-up. In the end, the
venture manages to suck in Rs 30 crore of investor funds, and decimates
much of Mr. Desai's personal wealth. What follows is an in-depth
examination of this entrepreneurial failure. The honest and crisp
narrative results in a captivating read.

Attention Factory

Matthew Brennan follows the rapid rise of ByteDance from being just
another tech co­mpany to the behemoth that it has become today. In
particular, he tries to demystify the success of TikTok. He identifies
and explores the two internet trends that have fuelled TikTok's success:
(1) the popularity of the short video format; and (2) the use of AI in
recommendation engines. Several anecdotes about ByteDance, TikTok and
the founders, while widely known in China, have eluded the
English-speaking world so far. The author's key motivation for writing
the book is "to shine a light on the extensive knowledge gap on
ByteDance between China and the rest of the world".

So, dear reader and potential start-up entrepreneurs, fill up your tote
bag with these parcels of knowledge to help you to survive and thrive in
this age of über-competitive business. As Reid Hoffman reminds us,
"We're all constantly learning. Or should be. We're in permanent beta."

7 famous Indian start-up shutdowns that happened last year

Sometimes having to close doors on your start-up may seem like a
'failure' of sorts but remember this, failure is only temporary but
giving up is permanent.

In the world of start-ups, a failure has never considered a failure but
an opportunity to learn. That's why you will always see mantras such as
'fail fast' or 'fail forward' hanging in the offices of most start-ups
worldwide. We do this in order to normalize failure, to see it as a
feather in the cap of its founder, as a steppingstone on the way to
greatness, blah, blah...

But a hard truth that nobody can ignore is that failure sucks and it
sucks very badly. Nobody starts a start-up thinking of failure in
his/her mind just as nobody walks down their wedding aisle thinking of
divorce. Yet the majority of start-ups end in failures. Why is so?

Well, the answer could be anything from no market need to running out of
cash to getting outcompeted to even poor marketing techniques. But
whatever the reasons, they are responsible for costing the lives of 90%
of start-ups within the first 3 years of their birth (I know, I know the
figure is close to 75% but shh.... I am trying to dramatize the effect
here).

Start-up shutdowns that happen in India last year were no different
(reasons may differ but their fates were identical) and it didn't help
either that they come from completely different backgrounds, be it
selling pre-owned furniture online to offering call center services to
even providing on-demand laundry. Enough said, let's have a look at some
such start-up failures.

1. Taskbob

Under the foundership of Assem Kheere, Taskbob, a Mumbai-based home
services start-up run out of its course in just 2 years after amassing a
whopping $5.7 million from external funding from three different
investors.

2. Fashionara

Cofounded by Darpan Munjal (formerly chief technology officer at Times
Internet Ltd.) and Arun Sirdeshmukh (former Reliance Trends CEO), this
Bangalore-based fashion e-tailer, Fashionara, burnt out last year even
after bagging $8 million in funding and running for 4 straight years.

3. Truckmandi

Founded in 2014 by former Snapdeal executives Anurag Jain and Ankit
Singh under Fixinnov Technology Pvt Ltd, Truckmandi also managed to
raise $2 million from Ritesh Dwivedy (founder of JustEat India) and
other investors but shut down in one and a half years due to poor
margins and cash burn.

4. Splitkart

Splitkart, a Gurgaon-based company whose mobile app allowed users to
split bills and plan outings, also ceased its operations in June 2017
due to undisclosed reasons. It was co-founded in 2015 by Sharique Khan
and Monajeet Sinha.

5. BuildZar

Another Gurgaon-based company named Glow Homes Technologies Pvt Ltd.
started BuildZar, a B2B marketplace for construction materials which
also managed to raise $4 million funds from Puneet Dalmia (managing
director of Dalmia Bharat Groups) but ran out of its juice in just 9
months, the reason given was demonetization.

6. FabFurnish

FabFurnish was a Mumbai-based online furniture store which was acquired
from Germany's Rocket Internet (as per Times of India) by Vikram Chopra,
Mehul Agrawal and Vaibhav Aggarwal in 2011. It also managed to die a
slow death in 2017 due to sluggish demand and the complexity of the
business.

7. Stayzilla

Stayzilla was a Bengaluru-based company that falls under the category of
hotel aggregator and was co-founded in 2005 by Yogendra Vasupal (Yogi),
Rupal Yogendra and Sachit Singhi. It also raised a funding of $33.5
million and was backed by Nexus Venture Partners and Matrix partners.
But even that could not save this company from shutdown in Feb 2017, the
reasons given were high costs and low revenues.

And the list goes on...

Here I have covered only 7 of the famous start-up shutdowns that
happened last year but believe me, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
Ideally, this list should have contained over a hundred entries, names
such as HotelsAroundYou, Finomena, Cardback, Genie etc. offering a wide
variety of services ranging from B2B logistics to outsource
telemarketing services to dating apps to even connecting celebs with
fans. But I suppose that would have made this list way too long.

I understand all this talk must have made you founders a little
disheartening (no, don't deny) but the important thing to remember here
is that, though we see failures everywhere, don't let them scare into
never trying. Instead, try to learn whatever you can from your mistakes
and carry it forward. And never forget the old saying, "try and try till
you succeed".

Biggest banking failure since 2008: Silicon Valley Bank collapses as
depositors pull cash

Millennium Post Newspaper

March 12, 2023 Sunday

Copyright 2023 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights

Length: 840 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi/New York: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized the
assets of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, marking the largest bank
failure since Washington Mutual during the height of the 2008 financial
crisis. The bank failed after depositors, mostly technology workers, and
venture capital-backed companies began withdrawing their money, creating
a run on the bank. FDIC said that depositors will have access to their
insured deposits - capped at $250,000 - by Monday (March 13). Silicon
Valley was heavily exposed to tech industry and there is little chance
of contagion in the banking sector as there was in the months leading up
to the Great Recession more than a decade ago. Major banks have
sufficient capital to avoid a similar situation.

The FDIC ordered the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and immediately took
position of all deposits at the bank Friday. The bank had $209 billion
in assets and $175.4 billion in deposits at the time of failure, the
FDIC said in a statement. It was unclear how much of the deposits were
above the $250,000 insurance limit at the moment. However, data
submitted to the FDIC by the bank at the end of 2022 showed that 89 per
cent of its $175 billion in deposits were uninsured. Notably, the FDIC
did not announce a buyer of Silicon Valley's assets, which is typically
when there's an orderly wind down of a bank. The FDIC also seized the
bank's assets in the middle of the business day, a sign of how dire the
situation had become. The financial health of Silicon Valley Bank was
increasingly in question this week after the bank announced plans to
raise up to $1.75 billion in order to strengthen its capital position
amid concerns about higher interest rates and the economy. Shares of SVB
Financial Group, the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, had
plummeted nearly...70 per cent before trading was halted before the
opening bell on the Nasdaq. CNBC reported that attempts to raise capital
failed and the bank was now looking to sell itself. Silicon Valley bank
was not a small bank, it's the 16th largest bank in the country, holding
$210 billion in assets. It acts as a major financial conduit for venture
capital-backed companies, which have been hit hard in the past 18 months
as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates and made riskier tech
assets less attractive to investors. Venture capital-backed companies
were being reportedly advised to pull at least two months' worth of
"burn" cash out of Silicon Valley Bank to cover their expenses.
Typically, VC-backed companies are not profitable and how quickly they
use the cash they need to run their businesses their so-called "burn
rate" is a typically important metric for investors. Diversified banks
like Bank of America and JPMorgan pulled out of an early slump due to
data released Friday by the Labor Department, but regional banks,
particularly those with heavy exposure to the tech industry, were in
decline. Moreover, depositors with funds exceeding insurance caps will
get receivership certificates for their uninsured balances, meaning
businesses with big deposits stuck at the bank are unlikely to get their
money out soon. This is where the real problem lies. While the full
scale of the impact of SVB's failure on Indian start-ups will only
become clear on Monday, several start-up founders said that not being
able to take out more than $250,000 from their accounts will severely
impact their runway. Amid a funding winter, where availability of funds
for start-ups is already dwindling, this could prove to be a major
roadblock for them, especially young businesses. On a poll run on the
WhatsApp group of Indian founders whose start-ups were incubated by the
US-based technology start-up accelerator YCombinator (YC), a large
numbers of founders said that a majority of them had more than $250,000
with SVB - the amount that will be insured by the US regulators - with
some of them having parked more than $1 million in their SVB accounts.
Not just start-ups, SVB was also a preferred personal banker for several
ultra-high net-worth individuals in the technology space. A founder
explained that SVB had traditionally been the default banking partner
for most start-ups because of its legacy in technology and experience of
banking high growth and high burn companies. Basically, it dealt with
businesses that traditional banks would typically stay away from given
the perceived risk of failure. For insured depositors, the funds will be
accessible by Monday morning, but the process could be long and
complicated for uninsured depositors, who will get a "receivership
certificate". The FDIC also said future dividend payments "may be made"
to pay off uninsured funds as the bank's assets are sold. This could
spark major concerns for thousands of uninsured depositors, who are
typically not individuals but companies that need cash on hand for
payroll and other expenses. So, even if the SVB crisis does not trigger
a full-blown financial crisis, it has definitely put the livelihoods of
many at risk.

Why Failing Fast Is Good Decoding The Lean Start Up Theory

Business World

It's thrilling to start a business; to watch your idea come to life and
years of hard work culminate into your own start-up. Unfortunately, the
"build it and they will come" approach holds little water, and those
sudden success stories you read about are usually the product of years
of hard effort behind the scenes. An IBM Institute study finds that 90%
of Indian start-ups fail within the first five years of inception1.
Simply said, because of diverse reasons, whether it's time, money, or
skill, start-up success eludes many. Failure has a negative connotation
in many contexts. But what if someone told you, not just failing, but
failing quickly, is the easiest and least expensive method to learn -
and, in many situations, the shortest road to success.

The Lean Start-up Theory is based on this very same foundation- created
by Eric Ries, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and author of "The Lean
Start-up." Lean emphasizes the creation of a product or service with the
fewest possible characteristics. The theory is that instead of spending
a lot of time and money to bring a product to market, it's preferable to
bring a minimal version to market, also known as the minimum viable
product, and analyse user feedback. It is an iterative improvement
approach with a continual feedback and improvement cycle. Rapid learning
can assist in identifying difficulties and help start-ups to fail
quickly and pivot to become more productive. Remember, learning occurs
in a variety of settings, not simply in formal courses. In a start-up
setting, failure is appreciated for the numerous lessons it teaches- it
is not about pointing fingers and assigning blame, but rather about
examining what went wrong and drawing lessons from it. There is no doubt
that we may learn from our mistakes. The challenge is how to learn
quickly so that we may learn when to alter course and pursue something
that will help us achieve greater success.

So, how do you deploy this methodology to reach the heights of success
that you have planned for? The lean start-up strategy is a three-step
process that helps businesses improve their decision-making in order to
reach a larger market. Let's deep dive into how this process can help
you decide whether your start-up has a marketable product from the idea
to the learning phase.

1. Build

Your start-up's aim during this phase should be to create or develop its
MVP - "minimum viable product," or the bare minimum product that can be
produced to test a number of assumptions. It should have a specific
level of quality and usefulness. As a budding entrepreneur, you must
move quickly and not waste time on lengthy development activities as
your MVP doesn't require advanced features and functions. This means
that a business in its early stages that hasn't yet achieved
product-market fit, you have the liberty to create something that isn't
very detailed and only for testing the market.

2. Measure

After you've created your MVP, you can present it to various target
groups, who will test it and provide feedback and thoughts. The lean
start-up process has now progressed to the second level. It is natural
that you probably had an idea about which client demands your product or
service solves before you even produced your MVP- this insight will help
you in comparing the statistics from your MVP to your original concept.
You may make modifications to your product based on the feedback and
experiences of your consumer- popularly termed as 'agile development'.
It is at this crucial stage that you decide if there isn't enough
interest in your MVP, it might be a hint that it isn't feasible, and
you'll struggle to create a long-term business - failing fast is not so
bad now?!

3. Learn

It's time to determine how to proceed with your business concept now
that you have your MVP, customer feedback, and data. Is there enough
demand for your concept that it makes sense to start a company and go
through the product development process? Or do you have to alter your
strategy and go through the process again? This is the lean start-up
methodology's third stage. It's here that you'll decide whether to
pursue your company concept or take a different path.

Ries' approach may be used to track progress as you proceed through the
build-measure-learn loop. Consumer feedback may be used to determine how
well your tweaks and adjustments are fulfilling customer demands - Ries
refers to this as "verified learning." We have witnessed several
startups fail and one of the primary reasons for it is the rush to
launch an untested product in the market, bringing about their demise.
Building an MVP would be ideal for any startup during the early stages
as well as testing it in the market.

Taking an example from the playbook of the technology sector, products
undergo beta testing not just to test its integrity but to also test its
acceptability. Several established organizations as well as unicorns
still test new products so that it is market ready and acceptable by the
customers. Thereby, the Lean Start-up Theory is not only viable but also
applicable in today's era. It is a methodology that can be utilized in
the early stages of a startup as well as for launches of a new product
or service for the market.

Author Tom Kelley once famously said, ''Fail often so you can succeed
sooner''- therefore, appreciate not just the finer points of product
development, but also the intricacies of the reason behind it. This will
be the most effective method for bringing your ideas to life.

ANALYSIS: Airline start-ups outweigh failures over summer months; After

period in which more attention has focused on start-up projects.

After a challenging first few months of the year in which a number of
high-profile carriers were forced to suspend operations amid mounting
financial problems, the summer months have largely proved a stable
period in which activity has focused on start-up projects.

It does, however, remain to be seen to what extent that proves a pause,
rather than a shift in the dynamic – notably in Europe where the busy
summer period is always kinder on airline cash-flows – while efforts to
revive some of the big-name casualties have struggled for momentum.

AIRLINE GROUNDINGS

India's Jet Airways is the largest airline failure of the year. The
carrier had been forced to ground an increasing portion of its fleet –
as its liquidity problems continued to mount – over the start of the
year before ultimately ceasing operations in mid-April.

Subsequent efforts to secure fresh investment in the airline have thus
far failed to secure concrete commitments.

A deadline for the latest expressions of interest initiative is the end
of August, under a process which envisages final bids submitted by
mid-October.

A teaser document released on 20 July to prospective applicants shows
that the airline still has 12 aircraft in its fleet, comprising six
Boeing 777-300ERs, three Airbus A330-300s and three 737s. The widebody
jets are under finance leases, while the 737s are owned by the company.
Most of its other aircraft have since been repossessed by lessors and
banks.

If a new investor and resolution plan can be found, it looks unlikely
that a revived Jet would be able to take back some of the route
authorities and slots that have been temporarily farmed out to other
carriers before the start of the northern winter scheduling season.

Brazil's aviation regulator meanwhile in May suspended Avianca Brazil's
authority to operate commercial flights, prompting the redistribution of
its take-off and landing slots. The move came after ANAC grounded
Avianca Brazil in May due to safety concerns.

Ocean Air, the airline company that operates Avianca Brazil, entered
bankruptcy administration in December 2018 with debt reportedly close to
$500 million.

The airline also formally leaves Star Alliance at the end of August –
proving third-time unlucky for the alliance in Brazil. Its first
alliance member from the country, founding member Varig, left in 2006
shortly before its collapse, while its replacement TAM was a member for
only four years before moving to Oneworld following its merger with LAN.

Elsewhere, Avianca's Argentinian affiliate has filed for bankruptcy
protection in an attempt to avoid liquidation and the cancellation of
its air operator's certificate as a potential consequence of its
prolonged grounding.

Avian Lineas Aereas, which operates under the Avianca Argentina brand
and is part-owned by Avianca's Colombian parent Synergy Group, had
announced on 9 June that it was suspending operations for 90 days, only
18 months after its launch in late 2017. It grounded its two ATR 72-600
turboprops, which were deployed on its two remaining domestic routes.

Chief executive Carlos Colunga says the airline will use the bankruptcy
process to "reformulate its business model" while attempting to keep
alive its only major asset, the AOC.

One brand in Europe to disappear over the summer was Air France's
short-lived millennial adventure Joon, which completed its last flight
on 26 June.

Unveiled as a "new-generation travel experience" in September 2017 and
undertaking its first flight in December of that year, Joon was
variously described as "a rooftop bar... an entertainment channel... a
personal assistant... a fashion designer", and "also an airline".

Plans for the unit had been drawn up in 2016 by Air France-KLM's
then-chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac amid a costly conflict between
the French flag carrier and aircrew that was stymieing expansion
ambitions.

The French flag carrier first said it would turn its back on Joon in
January 2019, when it acknowledged that the brand was "difficult to
understand from the outset for customers, for employees, for markets and
for investors".

European carriers had been among the hardest hit during first quarter of
the year, notably including the likes of Wow Air, Flybmi and Germania.

NEW ENTRANTS

But new – or in some cases familiar – entrants have taken to the skies
over the summer.

Uganda Airlines in late August completed a flight from Entebbe to
Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International. A previous incarnation of the
carrier ceased flights in 2001, following 24 years of operations. The
new Uganda Airlines operates two Bombardier CRJ900s, Cirium fleets data
shows, and has two Airbus A330-800s on order.

The carrier's booking engine on its website indicates it plans to fly to
several other countries in Africa, including Tanzania, South Sudan,
Somalia and Burundi.

Earlier in August, Ecuadorian start-up AeroRegional launched its
inaugural route, connecting Quito with Cuenca. The airline, which will
operate two Boeing 737-500s, obtained its air operator's certificate in
May and is based in Quito.

A month earlier in July, Chinese start-up carrier Genghis Khan Airlines
launched operations with the Comac ARJ21 aircraft. Genghis Khan Airlines
has received two ARJ21s and plans to operate 25 of the type by 2024.

New Japanese budget carrier Zipair Tokyo meanwhile is on track for a
2020 launch, having in July been granted an air transport business
license by Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism.

The budget arm of Japan Airlines will operate two Boeing 787-8 aircraft,
each with 290 seats, on two daily services: Tokyo Narita-Bangkok
Suvarnabhumi starting 14 May 2020, and Tokyo Narita-Seoul Incheon from 1
July 2020.

Dominican start-up Flycana plans to finalise its capitalisation and
recertification processes by year-end, as it also targets an operational
start next year. The carrier has aspirations to reach a 32-strong jet
fleet by 2025.

Chief executive Frederik Jacobsen says the airline has selected a
US-based investment bank to place Flycana shares worth $80 million with
both international and Dominican private and institutional investors.

"We will announce a lead investor soon," Jacobsen says. "Our
capitalisation will be sufficient to stem the financial burden of
quickly growing to a fleet size with a critical mass for a highly
profitable ultra-low-cost business model."

Another project in Latin America in July saw newly constituted company
Aerovias Internacionales del Uruguay file a request with national civil
aviation authority DINACIA to get certificated as a commercial airline.

The company plans to operate commercially under the Avinter brand.
DINACIA confirms only that the agency has "received the filing".

Start-up Great Dane Airlines has outlined plans for rapid growth, after
launching scheduled flights in the summer initially with one Embraer
195. Great Dane has already begun charter flights before inaugurating
scheduled services from Aalborg to Dublin, Edinburgh and Nice in June.
The nascent carrier intends to take one to two additional E195s each
year.

Nigerian start-up Ibom Air also began operating flights in June, across
a number of domestic routes. The carrier says its inaugural service took
off from Uyo's Victor Attah International airport, bound for Lagos.
Ibom's website shows that it offers multiple flights per day from its
Uyo base to Lagos and Abuja. The carrier is operating a pair of
Bombardier CRJ900s, of which it took delivery in February.

In September, start-up carrier Air Antwerp will operate its first flight
to London City airport, following the granting of its air operator's
certificate by Belgium's civil aviation authority.

The Belgian airline, a joint venture between KLM and CityJet, will use a
50-seat Fokker 50 turboprop to operate three return weekday flights plus
one Sunday evening service. KLM will be a codeshare partner on the
route.

Air Antwerp was created to fill the space left by the collapse of VLM,
which collapsed last autumn. The new carrier is 75% owned by Irish
operator CityJet and 25% owned by KLM.

Another new European operator flew its first commercial flight in May:
FlyBosnia launched initially from Sarajevo to Kuwait.

Air Astana's new budget arm operation, FlyArystan, also began operations
in May. It has been operating six routes from Almaty using a pair of
A320 narrowbodies, and has now identified Karaganda as a second base. It
will begin operations from Kazakhstan's fourth-largest city in the
second quarter of 2020.

Firm assists tech start-ups showing high-impact potential

The Sunday Independent (South Africa)

While multinationals such as Microsoft and Samsung are investing heavily
in start-ups on the African continent, an African player, Adanian Labs,
has entered the space with a warning for would-be entrepreneurs: it’s a
minefield out there with numerous pitfalls along the way.

If you’re looking to launch a greenfield business enterprise, you’re
likely under no illusion about the task that awaits you, even if it’s
not your first entrepreneurial venture, according to John Kamara, the
co-founder of Adanian Labs.

Warning of the tough road for tech start-ups as disruptors in the
holistic empowerment of the ecosystem, Kamara says that in 2020 the
average start-up failure rate in Africa was 54%.

Business intelligence publishers Mondaq, citing 2019 research from UWC,
reported that between 70% and 80% of South African start-ups fail within
five years.

This poses a huge development challenge for the country, reinforcing the
reality that without quality, scalable solutions, resilience and
sustainable growth remain beyond the reach of many early-stage
entrepreneurial ventures.

This is the stage onto which Adanian Labs has stepped, bringing with it
the enormous and diverse experience of its founders in launching and
nurturing new business in productive sectors of the economy.

Therefore, with more than half of start-ups launched on the continent
failing, it’s important to have a dedicated business-building partner to
guide you through every step of the process and enable you to avoid the
common pitfalls that make you fail.

And Kamara knows what he’s talking about. Since its launch in 2020,
Adanian Labs, founded by Bendon Murgor, Irene Kiwia and Kamara, has
incubated 14 tech start-ups across different sectors and raised seed
funding for some of them.

The lab incubates, builds, nurtures and launches scalable technology
start-ups for sustainable impact in Africa with a model built on the
UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

The programme is active in five African jurisdictions – Kenya, Nigeria,
Tanzania, Zambia and now South Africa. Kamara says their mission is to
build 300 impact-driven tech start-ups that are commercially viable and
scalable across the continent and beyond, with a vision to create
exponential value for the African economy through youth empowerment. The
Adanian Labs model differs from its peers in the incubation process
through its focused approach to providing advisory services to
start-ups: technology teams to build their solutions, support functions
to build frameworks for structures and processes, and fund-raising.

The Adanian Labs Venture Building Programme offers a blend of technology
development, technical support, business mentorship, access to market,
partnerships and up to $120 000 (R1.9 million) pre-seed or seed funding.
The programme is open to start-ups with a prototype that can be further
developed.

Ideal start-ups should have high-impact potential.

Unlike start-up funds and accelerators – themselves necessary for the
venture ecosystem – the Venture Building Programme favours innovation as
an approach to building successful companies. The Adanian Labs model
draws on its experience from working with new and established start-ups
to inform its approaches to early-stage business development and apply
it to structural challenges in the start-up life cycle. Africa is ripe
for investment in start-ups making a difference in the tech space.
“There is huge potential for Africa to become a thriving hub of digital
innovation on the global start-up landscape. Our ambition is to see an
explosion of local invention that will contribute positively, not just
to Africa’s digital economy, but to global society,” said Wael
Elkabbany, managing director, Microsoft Africa Transformation Office.

Microsoft announced on March 3 that its recently established Africa
Transformation Office (ATO) plans to launch new initiatives to speed up
the growth of 10 000 African start-ups and fast-track investment in
Africa’s start-up ecosystem over the next five years.

To enable start-ups to rapidly scale using investment funding, Microsoft
is establishing industry alliances and partnerships with venture capital
investors that will facilitate access to $500m in potential funding for
African start-ups. This funding will come from a network of venture
capital investors.

Microsoft believes the vibrant African start-up market is well placed to
become a cornerstone of the continent’s digital economy, supporting
local innovation through relevant solutions to societal challenges.

“Investments into Africa’s start-up ecosystem are growing at an exciting
pace. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, there are more than 640 active tech hubs across Africa,
accelerating innovation and creating employment, particularly among the
youth,” according to Elkabbany.

But Elkabbany says “currently the African start-up market represents
less than 1% of total investments worldwide”.

Gerald Maithya, start-ups lead, Microsoft ATO, said: “Our partnerships
with key African accelerators provide crucial support to accelerate
growth-stage start-ups with their business development and market
expansion plans.”

Microsoft will partner with B2B-focused start-ups, scale-ups,
“soonicorns” (businesses with the potential to become unicorns) and
unicorns across a range of leading African industries, and those
concentrated on working with SMEs.

“We understand that each start-up is unique and exists beyond the
limitations of a one-size-fits-all partnership model. Therefore,
Microsoft will tailor each partnership to the needs of individual
start-ups, providing support and access – whether to technology, markets
and co-sell opportunities, funding, or digital skills – to enable them
to grow and contribute to the wider economic growth of Africa,” said
Maithya.

South Korean multinational Samsung SA is mentoring 19 South African
start-ups as part of its employee volunteer programme. The initiative is
also part of Samsung’s Global Start-up Acceleration Programme which is
being carried out in Indonesia, Malaysia, India and South Africa.

In all the mentorship will benefit 80 selected start-ups from around the
world. In addition, five of the 80 start-ups will be invited to visit
Samsung’s global headquarters in Seoul, South Korea.

According to Samsung SA director for the business innovation group and
corporate affairs Hlubi Shivanda, the company has partnered with the
Small Enterprise Development Agency and non-profit Nangila to provide
infrastructure and mentorship to fledgling businesses. Up to 34
employees from Samsung’s global headquarters have volunteered to mentor
19 South African start-ups in a four-day boot camp. “We believe this can
be the catalyst that helps the entrepreneurship ecosystem grow,” said
Shivanda.

The role of Adanian Labs on the continent offers plenty of hope if one
considers its successes with Afya Rekod, a consumer-driven digital
health data platform; Phema-Agri, an agriculture crowdfunding platform;
Paylend, SME credit-lending solution; Twaa, a digital space for all
women; eCobba, a digital platform for savings and investment groups;
RewardAdz, which allows users to earn money via ads; and Ada Animation,
which arranges boot camps for developing top-tier animators.

Kamara’s firm is inviting applications from sectors like FinTech,
EduTech, AgriTech, HealthTech, Envirotech, InsurTech, EnergyTech,
Smart-city, MobilityTech, ImmersiveTech including internet of things,
blockchain and AI start-ups.

'AI is helping in the expansion of startup healthcare companies to great
extent'

Healthcare start-ups are expanding and opening up new horizons around
the world. With the newest technology and regulations, the healthcare
sector is constantly changing, necessitating the establishment of tech
start-ups shares Dr Shrenik Shah, Director, Montage Laboratories Pvt.
Ltd in an interaction with Kaanchi Chawla of Elets News Network (ENN).
Edited excerpts:

What position do you think Indian healthcare start-ups are in right now,
and how are they doing?

Since the launch of Startup India, a government of India initiative, on
August 15, 2015, with an action plan concentrating on three areas:

* Simplification and hand holding

* Funding support and incentives

* Industry-Academia partnership and incubation. Start-ups have started
coming on the market and there are many in healthcare too.

Start-ups in healthcare are doing very well, and some of them have grown
to a great extent, like Netmeds, HealthifyMe, and PharmEasy. They
started with a small concept and today they have grown to top healthcare
startups.

An Ahmedabad-based start-up, Wizarma Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., has recently
been acquired with a 100 per cent stake by Tata's 1 mg at a very young
age.

Healthcare has drastically evolved over the past decade in India. From
affordable insurance, and easy access to doctors and medicines to the
invention of tech-enabled life-savings treatments, quality of healthcare
is growing - thanks to innovation and disruption offered by mushrooming
health tech startups. What you see today is just a glimpse of what the
future has in store!

According to a research by the Internet and Mobile Association of India
and Praxis Global Alliance, India's health tech sector was valued at
US$1.9 billion in 2020. This is set to grow at a CAGR of 39 per cent to
touch US $5 billion by 2023 and a staggering US $50 billion by 2033,
according to RBSA Advisors. With almost 7500 health tech start-ups in
India currently fueling growth, and thousands more that will take seed
in the coming few years, the state of healthcare in India looks very
promising.

Over the past few years, healthcare has seen a dramatic evolution. New
developments and trends in the healthcare sector are being developed by
start-ups in that sector. Do you believe the healthcare services offered
by start-ups to patients are of high quality?

Over the last decade, technologies have been driving the healthcare
industry through various innovations in how we find, prevent, and cure
diseases. This shouldn't have happened without the massive growth of
AI-driven technologies and digitisation of healthcare workflows, as a
response to more savage global conditions, as well as the rising demand
for accessible and quality medical services.

As we press on into the future, it's critical to remain mindful of the
trends driving healthcare technology in 2022. Although legacy software
and infrastructure are critical to the success of modern hospitals and
care centers, it's important that we consider how those systems can
integrate with newer technologies or how they may eventually be replaced
with more reliable systems. The focus should be on improving
performance, productivity, efficiency, and security without sacrificing
reliability or accessibility.

The healthcare services provided by start-ups are very easy to get (easy
accessibility), cheaper, use modern technology, and have quality
services. But the very frequent appearance of the news in media that
online sales of medicines, and cosmetics are spurious and mis branded is
raising many questions on the authenticity of medicines. Regulatory
control is also poor in the online sale of medicines.

Do you believe Artificial Intelligence is making a sufficient
contribution to the expansion of start-up healthcare companies in India?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies are increasingly
prevalent in business and society and are also applied to healthcare.
These technologies have the potential to transform many aspects of
patient care, as well as administrative processes within the provider,
payers, and pharmaceutical organisations.

There are already a lot of research studies suggesting that AI can
perform better than humans at key healthcare tasks, such as diagnosing
diseases. Today, algorithms are already outperforming radiologists at
spotting malignant tumours, and guiding researchers in how to construct
cohorts for costly clinical trials. However, for a variety of reasons,
it will be many years before AI replaces humans for broad medical
process domains. AI offers to automate aspects of care, and some of the
barriers to rapid implementation of AI in healthcare.

AI is helping the expansion of startup healthcare companies in India to
a great extent.

Hospitals and doctors may streamline operations, engage patients,
streamline procurement procedures, and more with the help of digital
care ecosystems provided by health tech start-ups. What are your
thoughts on it?

Healthcare, and more precisely, hospitals, are undergoing a fullscale
digital care ecosystem. The underlying benefits are many - improved
patient reach and health outcomes, reduced overall costs, and increased
competitiveness. The higher percentage of the younger population, rising
income levels, ageing population, growing health awareness, and changing
attitude towards preventive healthcare, etc. are expected to boost
healthcare services demand in the future. Also, the focus is shifting
from health care to health and well-being.

Health tech start-ups will make the task easier for doctors and
hospitals regarding operations, managing patients (outside and inside
the hospital), procurement, and surgeries/procedures. Once the data of
the patient with the diagnosis is fed into the system, the software will
analyse everything, like the availability of medicines, availability of
doctors for surgery/ procedures, availability of other requirements for
the surgery/ availability of beds/rooms in the hospital, etc. so the
administrative load will reduce drastically without any error or code.

What opportunities and threats do you think Indian start-ups in the
healthcare industry face?

There are more people alive on the earth than have already died. The
population of the world is crossing 8 billion, and India is going to
overtake China in terms of population shortly and will become the most
populated country in the world, fortunately, or unfortunately.

High population, modernisation in the lifestyle and digitalisation of
everything is offering many opportunities in healthcare.

The higher percentage of the younger population, rising income levels,
ageing population, growing health awareness, and changing attitude
towards preventive healthcare, etc. are expected to boost healthcare
services demand in the future. Also, the focus is shifting from health
care to health and well-being. In the future, there will be a greater
focus on promoting healthy lifestyles, vitality, and wellness; on
primary and secondary prevention; and on early diagnosis. This offers
great opportunities for start-ups in healthcare.

However, growth - a frustrating process, general management, customer
trust, security and privacy, failure to deliver as expected, lack of
proper innovation, and competition are the threats for them.

The healthcare startup world is growing at an exponential rate, with
both risks and opportunities offered. Combined with the blast of
technology, this can be viewed as a golden age for healthcare startups.
The challenges for healthcare startups might be there, but in time,
nothing is impossible for talented visionaries in the healthcare
industry.

How did this year go for Indian healthcare start-ups? What are their
expectations for the future and where do they envision themselves as
2023 draws closer?

The year 2022 is almost about to be over, and the healthcare industry is
preparing for, what promises to be a most interesting 2023.

During the COVID -19 pandemic, healthcare startups have done wonderful
growth by providing patient-centric services, and that has given a boost
to them. In 2022, start-ups have made good growth regarding their reach
to customers and also in their valuation. Many start-ups have got the
advantage of increasing valuation regarding stake dilution or getting
private equity or venture capitalist with them.

In 2023, healthcare start-ups will have good deals - big and small- and
increasing regulatory scrutiny will make 2023 a year to remember for
all.

Startups will look:

* For private equity companies to begin vacuuming up sub-scale companies
and consolidating them into bigger companies.

* For some of the weaklings in the start-up.

* For failure among the wide range of companies that were valued more on
the total addressable market than on any real-world impact on patient
care.

What do you think about the current state and prospects for your
organisation in the digitally driven healthcare ecosystem?

Being attached to pharmaceutical manufacturing for many years, we have
to run fast to meet with a digitally driven healthcare ecosystem. We
have to keep on improving ourselves regarding introducing new products,
use of modern technologies, continuous upgrade in the terms of
international regulatory compliance, change in the mindset of the people
working with us and make them understand "change is a continuous process
and we have to adopt it". We have to consider drawing up a long term
strategic plan for developing and implementing digitalisation,
resolution on ICD-11 and the WHO family of international classifications
and terminologies, the three-part National eHealth strategy toolkit, six
member states current digital health situation and status, actions,
strategies, policies and investments, and recommendations of various
United Nations panels on digital and innovation topics.

Madhya Pradesh: Engineers aplenty, but very few employable

Free Press Journal (India)

Indore (Madhya Pradesh): "What do you want to do after school?" "Become
an engineer..." An obvious answer for many Indians, mostly because of
societal pressures and the idea that an engineering degree will give
them a stable future. However, only 40% of engineering graduates end up
doing an internship and 36% do any projects beyond coursework.

This is citing from the latest National Employability Report. It further
added that only 3.84% of engineers are employable in software-related
jobs at start-ups.

So, while we are looking forward to start-ups and find it the best way
to 'Make In India', the lack of employability is a possible reason for
start-up failure.

In fact, an IBM Institute study finds that 90% of Indian start-ups fail
within the first five years of inception.

"Around 3% of engineers possess new-age skills in areas such as AI,
Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Mobile technologies. On an
aggregate level, employability in these areas is around 1.5-1.7%," said
the employability report.

The essential skills even though imparted fails to make their place in
the engineer's mind. Perhaps this is due to a lack of interest among
students, who get into engineering as a safety net.

In fact, United States has a much higher proportion of engineers, almost
four times, but they have good programming skills as compared to India,
added the report.

"A much higher percentage of Indian engineers (37.7%) cannot write an
error-free code, as compared to China (10.35%)," said the report. The
only way out is perhaps training on codes as well AI.

Some initiatives in Indore including engineering companies and start-ups
are trying to help out such engineers, who fail to gain the skill.

One such initiative is headed by Er Soumya Upadhyay who runs her
start-up. "In the present scenario where budding engineers usually talk
about unemployment, lower package or lack of government jobs, they
should focus on the skills and hands-on experience in at least initial
age of professional life," she said.

Soumya has been running her venture for the last 7 years and has a team

How the Silicon Valley Bank debacle unfolded & rocked India's start-up

had more than $250,000 parked in the bank.

Silicon Valley Bank, a lender to some of the biggest names in the tech
world, became the largest bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis.
Its shutdown sparked panic among Indian start-up founders, who had more
than $250,000 parked in the bank.

The collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank was nearly a black swan event,
sending shock waves some 8,000 miles away. The crisis set alarm bells
ringing at a number of India's start-ups with accounts at the bank that
had millions of dollars stuck in them. And if not for a manoeuvre of the
US government at the last minute, these businesses had almost embraced
an unceremonious fate: mass layoffs, and in some cases, extinction.

In just 48 hours last week, as the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed,
hundreds of Indian start-ups nearly came undone. But the crisis seems
averted, for now.

The epicentre

At the heart of the crisis lies the 40-year-old SVB, a bank with a
legacy of dealing with high growth, but also high-risk businesses such
as technology start-ups. The bank had a number of things going for it.

It offered an easy way for start-ups in India, especially in the SaaS
(software as a service) sector, who have a number of US clients, to park
their cash, as firms could set up their bank accounts without needing a
United States Social Security Number or Income Tax Identification
Number. Besides, as a founder explained, SVB had a very strong network
of lawyers and accountants in the US who, for a fee, actively
recommended the bank to high-growth start-ups.

Basically, it dealt with businesses that traditional banks typically
stay away from given the perceived risk of failure and lent to start-ups
when other sources of funding were hard to come by. "I'd say until a few
years ago, it was only SVB; only today have start-ups started to get
other funding options," a founder has earlier told The Indian Express.

Given its perceived goodwill of having been there for these businesses
when traditional banks were not, SVB had received a massive volume of
deposits during the 2020-2021 tech boom and invested the proceeds into
long-term Treasury bonds while interest rates were low. Like other
banks, Silicon Valley Bank kept a small amount of the deposits on hand
and invested the rest with the hope of earning a return.

That strategy was working until the US Federal Reserve began raising
interest rates last year to cool inflation. At the same time, startup
funding started to dry up, putting pressure on many of the bank's
clients - who then began to withdraw their money. To pay those requests,
Silicon Valley Bank was forced to sell off some of its investments at a
time when their value had declined. In the process, it lost nearly $2
billion.

That triggered mass withdrawal requests to the tune of $42 billion in
one day from the bank as depositors moved to redeem their parked funds.
But not everyone was successful.

The panic

The bank had failed. The US government shut it down and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) asked companies with accounts
containing more than $250,000 to contact a toll-free number.

Last Friday (March 10) night, it was a long wait for several Indian
start-up founders who had accounts at SVB and had a lot more than
$250,000 parked there. That was the amount that was originally going to
be insured by the FDIC. If a business had more money than that in its
account - which hundreds of Indian start-ups did - it was unclear how
much time it would take them to recover its deposits.

"It is 4 am now and we have been on hold at the toll-free number given
by the FDIC for over half an hour. We have around $2 million in our SVB
account and need that to create payroll," a founder had told this paper
early last weekend.

These start-ups used their SVB deposits to create payrolls, and not
having access to that money would have meant that they would have had to
fire a number of employees. And to compound the problem, the start-up
ecosystem is already going through a funding winter, which has forced
businesses to dip into their savings more and more. Panic had set in.

In a poll run on the WhatsApp group of Indian founders whose start-ups
were incubated by the US-based technology start-up accelerator
YCombinator (YC), a majority of the founders said they had more than
$250,000 with SVB, with some having parked more than $1 million in their
SVB accounts. SVB was also a preferred personal banker for several
ultra-high-net-worth individuals in the technology space.

"I did not sleep for almost two days. I was constantly on calls with
lawyers and accountants to figure out a way to save the company,"
another founder, requesting anonymity said. His business had close to $3
million in its SVB account.

The relief

As the US government shut down the bank on Friday, it said that
depositors would have access to their insured amount of $250,000
starting Monday (March 13). But that was always going to be an
inconsequential amount. As of December 2022, SVB had $209 billion in
total assets and about $175 billion in total deposits. But, 89 per cent
of its $175 billion in deposits were uninsured.

The bank's depositors had to be helped in order to prevent a contagion
effect from severely impacting America's banking system. But from the
learnings of the 2008 financial crisis, and the public sentiment around
bank failures, a bailout would not have been a popular move.

Then finally on Sunday (March 12) night, the US government came up with
a plan. Instead of a total government bailout that would have required
taxpayer money, the United States Federal Reserve announced that it
would make available additional loans to eligible depository
institutions to help assure that banks have the ability to meet the
needs of all their depositors.

A new entity called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) will be created
and it will offer loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings
associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions.
Those taking advantage of the facility will be asked to pledge
high-quality collateral such as Treasuries, agency debt and
mortgage-backed securities.

The Department of the Treasury will make available up to $25 billion
from the Exchange Stabilisation Fund as a backstop for the BTFP.
However, the Federal Reserve said it did not anticipate that it would be
necessary to draw on these backstop funds.

Thanks to the manoeuvre, Indian start-ups said they could manage to
withdraw their money.

A founder of a start-up backed by the US-based technology accelerator
YCombinator (YC) said that the process to withdraw the money was smooth,
although the wait times were long given the increased load on the bank's
servers as businesses in India and around the world started withdrawing
their money en masse.

For now, a number of these firms are wiring their money from SVB to
another US-based bank's account given that SWIFT transfers - a secure
and standardised method of sending or receiving money from banks
anywhere in the world - do not work for SVB accounts.

"You can't do a SWIFT wire from an SVB account. So we're all just wiring
to another US Bank account and then deciding what to do. I've heard of
other companies succeeding with wires. And we've so far had a great
experience switching to Brex since we already had their credit card,"
the founder quoted above said.

5 UX mistakes that make startup failure inevitable

Building a successful startup is difficult. By addressing the needs of
the target audience, designing the product carefully to make it relevant
to users, and tracking the product usage will ensure your startup is
well on its way to long-term success.

India has become home to scores of successful startups in the past
decade. A study done by IBM shows that the main reason for more than 90
percent of startups failing is in fact lack of innovation. Startups
today are emulating existing successful global ideas. This means their
products are being launched without any understanding of their real
target audience. This along with the lack of design intervention soon
becomes a recipe for failure. The lack of understanding of a brand
trickles down to the product and results in the delivery of poor user
experience (UX).

Here are the top five UX mistakes that make startup failure inevitable:

1.Not making the target audience the centre of your universe

Let's start with the first and foremost mistake made in the startup
lifecycle - forgetting that the app or product is being built for the
actual users and not just the business owners. Why does this happen?
Because business owners huddle in a room together and build a product
out of all their favourite features without identifying and addressing
the needs of their target audience.

2.Using the wrong research methods won't get you the right results

Using wrong research methods is a bigger crime than no research at all.
Let's take Walmart for example. It lost an estimated $1.85 million even
though it listened to its customers. You might be wondering how this
happened. Well, their research lacked the right context, because who
wouldn't choose 'spacious' as the answer when there's absolutely no
context? Walmart used this research and based its store revamp strategy
on making it more 'spacious', only to reverse it completely.

Another mistake is simply calling up friends (who are not your target
audience) and asking for their opinions under the pretense of research.
Research costs a lot of time and money, and treating it as a "buzzword"
at this stage will prove to be a penny wise pound foolish approach in
the long run. Even though there are different qualitative or
quantitative research practices available, remember choosing the right
method at the right time is equally important.

3.Copying design from competitors

Every product has different goals and user needs to meet, and it cannot
look and work exactly like a competitor's product. Every element of the
product should be designed carefully to make it relevant to the brand
and its users. This will also give the product an edge over and above
what's available in the market.

4.Not validating whether the UX works with usability tests

Validation is an important part of the design process. Validating
through activities like usability tests give real qualitative feedback
from users, and an understanding as to what works and what can be
improved. These suggest valuable iterations and save money in the long
run.

5.Not maintaining the product after the launch

Once the product is live, it is very important to track usage and
collect feedback from users. Only through active maintenance can the
product be improved and stay relevant to the users. This is undoubtedly
the key to the success of a product.

Now, do you want to know how much revenue you can expect from your
investment in user experience? According to a report by IBM, "every
dollar invested in ease of use returns $10 to $100." That's potential
waiting to be tapped.

So, look for a UX expert that takes the time to understand your goals,
target audience, and product and who also chooses the right research you
need. Not to forget, one who also steers clear from all these mistakes.

An update on the progress of planned airline start-ups and on those
airlines that have suspended or ceased operations in recent months

NORTH AMERICA

JetBlue and Azul founder David Neeleman cemented his plans for a new US
start-up by striking a tentative deal at July's Farnborough air show for
60 Airbus A220-300s.

With his launching of JetBlue in 2002, Neeleman was responsible for one
of the last major new US entrants, and his plans for a new carrier
dominated headlines when they first emerged in June.

"After years of US airline consolidation, the conditions are improving
for a new generation of US airlines to emerge, focused on passenger
service and satisfaction," says Neeleman.

While initial reports suggested that the airline would be called Moxy,
Neeleman – in publicly disclosing a deal for A220s at Farnborough – said
this was just a working name. The carrier is eyeing launch in 2021.

He says the A220 will allow the new carrier to operate thin routes,
offering passenger comfort without compromising costs – particularly on
longer-range sectors.

Neeleman adds that the planned US start-up will eventually partner with
Brazil's Azul and TAP Air Portugal for transatlantic flying, with the
Airbus A220-300's range central to that long-term strategy. "We can fly
across the North Atlantic, down into the Caribbean and into Brazil," he
says.

Elsewhere in the region, WestJet's ultra-discount unit Swoop began
operations on 20 June and is already expanding into cross-border
flights. Swoop launched with services with a handful of domestic
Canadian routes but will in October launch flights to Las Vegas,
Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale and the Phoenix suburb of Mesa.

A number of new players have emerged in the Canadian low-cost market.
Flair Airlines launched last summer, while EnerJet and Jetlines continue
to target launch. In May, Jetlines recruited former Allegiant executive
Lukas Johnson as its new chief executive.

ASIA-PACIFIC

Vietnamese start-up Bamboo Airways expects to begin operations on 10
October. The carrier made the launch date public on its Facebook page,
after receiving government approval for its establishment, on 9 July.

Local media reports quote Bamboo's director Dang Tat Thang as saying
that the airline will begin ticket sales on 2 September, although it did
not specify the destinations or routes it would operate. However, it is
likely to operate flights to destinations where Bamboo's parent company
FLC Group has resorts and tourism investments.

Despite the carrier's revealing of its start date, Civil Aviation
Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) director general Dinh Viet Thang says
his administration is still considering Bamboo's application for an air
operator's certificate.

Bamboo in June committed to an order for 20 Boeing 787-9s, and plans to
deploy the aircraft on international routes to Europe and the USA. The
aircraft are tentatively scheduled to be delivered from April 2020
through 2021, says Boeing. The airline had previously signed a
memorandum of understanding for 24 Airbus A321neos, which remains in
place, says the carrier.

Planned start-up Starlux Airlines in May received a permit from
Taiwanese regulators for its establishment, marking the first step
towards getting its AOC. The target is to complete all necessary
requirements by the end of 2019, before launching operations in early
2020.

Starlux is in advanced talks to take 10 A321neos from lessors, with a
decision to be finalised in the first half of 2018. It also disclosed
plans at Farnborough to take up to 17 A350s to support its launch of
long-haul operations.

Cambodian start-up KC International Airlines received its first aircraft
at the end of June, an Airbus A320. The carrier was established in Phnom
Penh with $100 million in launch capital as a joint venture between
Cambodian and Chinese investors.

Indian carrier Star Air is now targeting launching operations in
September. The carrier's chief executive Simran Singh Tiwana expects two
Embraer ERJ-145s to arrive by September, and says that the carrier is
still in the process of acquiring an air operator's certificate.

Its network will focus on domestic routes operating under India's
regional connectivity scheme from its base at Bengaluru's Kempegowda
International airport.

Regional carrier JetGo Australia suspended its scheduled services after
entering voluntary administration on 1 June. Administrators say the
carrier will continue to operate limited charter services, while
scheduled services will remain suspended "for the duration of the
administration period".

EUROPE

European attention continues to focus on Vienna and the former Niki
operation, Laudamotion. Formed out of the assets of the Austrian carrier
by its founder Niki Lauda, Laudamotion launched in March and has since
added operations at Berlin Tegel.

Ryanair, which in July secured clearance to raise its stake in the
carrier from 25% to 75%, is expecting Laudamotion to lose around 150
million ($176 million) in its first year. But it is forecasting
breakeven by the third year of operations.

IAG, which had also been in the running to acquire Niki, in July
established a new Austrian-based low-cost carrier under its Level brand.
The new unit has four Airbus A321 narrowbodies sourced from now-defunct
Air Berlin.

Air Belgium launched flights in June after securing permission to
overfly Siberia. The airline is operating Airbus A340 services from
Brussels Charleroi to Asia, beginning with Hong Kong.

Air Nostrum's owners are creating a new carrier in Ireland called
Hibernian Airlines, which will specialise in European wet-lease
operations. The Spanish carrier, which in July announced a tie-up with
CityJet, plans to have the new carrier operating by the end of this
year.

Ukrainian budget carrier SkyUp began operations on 21 May with services
to resorts in Egypt. SkyUp has introduced a pair of five-year-old Boeing
737-800s and has also reached a deal with Boeing to take up to 10 737
Max jets. It has since secured rights to 55 routes, including 20
international scheduled routes from five cities.

Romanian operator Just Us Air added an A321 shortly after launching in
April with an A319.

Russian entrepreneur Arkady Evstafiev has already begun work on a
successor carrier to the collapsed Saratov Airlines, in which he was a
shareholder.

Saratov Airlines was grounded at the end of May, just months before a
newly developed airport for its home city was due to open. That came
less than four months after a fatal accident involving one of its
Antonov An-148s. This new carrier would aim to retain employees of the
grounded airline.

Swedish regional carrier Nextjet cancelled all flights and disclosed
plans to file for bankruptcy in May.

AFRICA

Nigeria’s transport minister Hadi Sirika unveiled Nigeria Air as the
chosen name for the African state's new national carrier, which hopes to
commence operations this year and build a fleet of 30 aircraft by 2023.

Sirika says the airline will be based on a public-private partnership
model. But while the government would offer support and backing to the
airline, it would hold only a minimal share, around 5%, of the carrier.

Detailing the plans at the Farnborough air show in July, Sirika said the
airline would start services in December with a small number of aircraft
– the type of which has yet to be disclosed, though negotiations are
taking place with Boeing and Airbus.

South African regulators in July reinstated SA Express's AOC after the
carrier was temporarily grounded. The airline suspended flights on 24
May when its operating licences and the certificates of airworthiness
for nine of its 21 aircraft were suspended following a safety audit.

The airline was initially limited to operating only those two aircraft
for which certificates of airworthiness have been secured. Former chief
Siza Mzimela has returned to manage the airline on an acting basis. She
has been part of a "ministerial intervention team" that was appointed in
May to stabilise the airline's operations. The carrier is aiming to
restore flights shortly.

Air Senegal began its first flights after securing its air operator's
certificate at the end of April, launching with a domestic service
between Dakar and Ziguinchor. Flight Fleets Analyzer data indicates that
Air Senegal has a fleet of two ATR 72-600s in service and a pair of
Airbus A330neos on order.

LATIN AMERICA

Argentina has awarded permits to San Luis-based airline Polar Lineas
Aereas to operate commercial passenger and cargo charter flights. The
airline is the creation of Daniel Barbosa, a former Aerolineas
Argentinas pilot and former chief executive of bankrupt Cata. According
to Barbosa, Polar will operate Boeing 737 aircraft.

In April, a Buenos Aires court removed all operational restrictions from
the city's new El Palomar low-cost airport, allowing Argentina's first
low-cost airline Flybondi to resume its original expansion plan. The
carrier, which launched flights in January, had been forced to switch
some of its flights to Aeroparque after local residents obtained a court
injunction limiting daily take-offs and landings.

Grounded Venezuelan carrier Aserca Airlines at the end of May
acknowledged that it was unable to resume operations and requested that
Venezuela's civil aviation authority INAC cancel its air operator's
certificate.

Valencia-based Aserca stopped flying in February after having to ground
gradually all of its nine Boeing MD-80s as the company was unable to
obtain state-assigned foreign currencies to import spare parts and pay
for insurance policies.

Aserca is the third and last of the airlines owned by Venezuelan
businessman Simeon Garcia that have gone out of business in months. His
Dominican Republic-based PAWA and Caracas-based Santa Barbara Airlines
also went into liquidation earlier this year.

To support, nurture early stage start-ups

Caspian Debt has partnered with the Center for Innovation Incubation &
Entrepreneurship (CIIE), the incubator of IIM Ahmedabad, to launch the
Innocity Startup School.

The Innocity Startup School is a 14 weeks, non-residential programme to
support and enhance the skills of start-ups in their early stages. It
will serve students and aspiring entrepreneurs across various
geographies and sectors that have limited access to High-Quality
Entrepreneurship training and knowledge.

Caspian Debt is a multi-sector debt funding company, providing
customised debt to professionally managed small and mid-market
companies, start-ups and enterprises that create a positive social and
environmental impact. Over past seven years, Caspian Debt has deployed
over ₹1,600 crore in capital to 137 companies through 327 loans, and
their portfolio companies have impacted 13 Sustainable Development
Goals.

holistic programme Innocity has developed a holistic programme on
entrepreneurship which not only helps aspiring entrepreneurs in knowing
themselves but also ability to evaluate their business model
objectively, understand funding sources, appreciate importance of good
governance and incorporate gender lens in their thinking.

S Viswanatha Prasad, Founder and Managing Director of Caspian Debt,
said, "As a scale up stage growth capital provider, Caspian Debt's
partnership with CIIE will meaningfully enhance our efforts towards
helping first generation entrepreneurs really get a head start, sustain,
and grow their businesses in a professional manner."

Chintan Bakshi, Partner Incubation, CIIE.CO, said: "We are enthusiastic
to launch Innocity Startup School with Caspian Debt. As part of
CIIE.CO's on-going programmes, we always take a deep dive with start-ups
discussing some of the most crucial methodologies and practices such as
lean start-up model, prototyping, unit economics, etc. to ensure they
start the right way and build a good foundation."

The start-up school is an accumulation of practices put into a structure
which can help any founder and thus become a critical difference between
start-up success and failure. It has been designed to be experiential,
since most of the workshops and sessions would be conducted or
facilitated by start-up founders from who have themselves implemented
them."

The Innocity Start-up School sessions will be conducted online every
week on Friday and Saturday for 2 hours.

The prevailing narrative around tech start-ups is a positive one.
Ambitious people flock to them hoping to improve the world and make
themselves rich. Venture capitalists make bullish bets on hunches over
the next big tech company and future profitability.

Policy-makers are in on the hype too. Supporting start-up ecosystems
with the aim of stimulating innovation, job creation and economic
development, all the while hailing local start-ups valued above $1bn -
known as 'unicorns' - as major success stories.

But the reality of the social and economic impact of tech start-ups does
not always align with this optimism.

"Tech isn't necessarily good or bad," says Melanie Hayes, the managing
partner of Bethnal Green Ventures, a London-based early-stage 'tech for
good' venture capital (VC) fund, which backs those aiming to tackle
social and environmental problems.

"The biggest challenge in the tech industry is when it lacks positive

intent, it can very easily become harmful," she says. "I don't think
jobs in start-ups are good or bad. But there are definitely good and bad
start-ups to work for."

Stories of start-up failures and excess pervade the media, such as Adam
Neumann, the extravagant ousted founder of WeWork, the office rental
start-up that fell from grace in 2019. Besides, concerns mount over
social media's impact on democratic societies, environmental damage from
tech operations, and the quality of work created by gigeconomy
platforms. There is a need to bring the tech start-up hype into a
practical perspective.

Tilting the dichotomy in favour of the benefits created by start-ups
over their unintended consequences will be crucial for these newly
founded businesses to align with the environmental, social and
governance agenda.

Entrepreneurship above all Growing numbers of start-up programmes
worldwide aim to foster entrepreneurship-based growth by

supporting the creation of new firms, particularly in innovative sectors
such as ICT. But with start-up failure rates as high as 90%,
remuneration offered at early-stage companies often falls short.

A recently published study of Danish registry data between 1992 and 2011
found that, on average, employees hired by start-ups earn roughly 17%
less over the next 10 years of their career than those hired by larger,
established firms. Those joining start-ups with large numbers of
employees earned a slight premium, according to the study.

"Blind enthusiasm for entrepreneurship seems wrong," Olav Sorenson,
professor of strategy at UCLA and a co-author of the Danish study tells
fDi in a joint interview with is co-author, Rodrigo Canales. "The
question is whether or not it is possible to craft policies that
generate more rapidly growing start-ups without having lots of small
experiments that fail," he explains.

Mr Canales, an assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Yale,
agrees: "If the main purpose of start-up ecosystems is to create a bunch
of good jobs, that is probably the wrong objective."

While some start-ups may grow to become large firms and create many
jobs, Mr Canales believes more common benefits of start-up ecosystems
include business model innovation and personal development for workers.

Jeppe Rindom, the co-founder and chief executive of Danish fintech
unicorn Pleo, which offers payment cards for employees to buy
workrelated products, is not surprised by the study's findings. He notes
that start-ups often compensate staff with stock warrants that only pay
out if the company is successful, and that some applicants are willing
to

take a pay cut of 10% to 20% for the learning experience "We hire
candidates that really take a deliberate choice of having a career in
start-ups," he says. "They value the journey and education from being
part of building a business."

Innovation potential Between June 2017 and 2021, the number of active
monthly start-up jobs in Denmark grew from 203,000 to 844,000, according
to Danske Bank's Hub initiative.

Camilla Rygaard-Hjalsted, the chief executive of Digital Hub Denmark, a
non-profit that promotes the Danish tech ecosystem, says start-ups have
a dual purpose.

"They can either take off and become unicorns, which is huge for the
country in terms of job creation and investment," she explains. "Or
start-ups help digital transformation at corporations that are falling
behind."

In a world where industries are being redefined by disruptive
technologies, such as blockchain, quantum computing and artificial
intelligence (AI), established firms have increasingly made bets on
start-ups as a means to foster innovation and stave off competition.

In 2020, corporate venture capital (CVC)-backed funding of start-ups
reached an all-time high of $73.1bn, an increase of 24% from 2019,
according to a report by CB Insights, even if the number of CVC-backed
deals fell marginally by 1.7% over the same period.

Rising entrepreneurship The Kauffman Foundation, a private, non-partisan
organisation that promotes and tracks US entrepreneurship, has also seen
a sharp increase in people starting businesses, as

many found themselves unemployed or in part-time jobs during Covid-19
lockdowns.

The Kaufmann indicators of early-stage entrepreneurship found that the
rate of new entrepreneurial activity reached its highest level for 25
years in 2020, with an average of 380 of every 100,000 adults becoming
entrepreneurs in a given month.

Philip Gaskin, vice president of entrepreneurship at the Kauffman
Foundation, tells fDi that their research indicates business creation
increases in economic downturns.

"Entrepreneurship drives economies," he says. "New entrepreneurs have
the ability to take an idea and turn it into a reality, and to create
more new jobs than big businesses. But the hurdles they have to jump
through to start these businesses need to be reduced."

While start-up early survival rates in 2020 fell to their lowest level
since the Great Recession, the average number of jobs created by US
start-ups in their first year stood at 5.03 per capita, according to
Kauffman.

Internationally, perceptions of entrepreneurship have been impacted by
the pandemic, too. An annual survey across 43 countries, conducted by
the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), a research consortium, finds
that uncertainty has presented more opportunities for entrepreneurs.

Aileen Ionescu-Somers, the executive director of GEM, says that the
"chaos" thrown up by Covid-19 - such as big shifts in trade and
shopping, changes to behavioural patterns and disruption to business
models - has led many to consider pursuing new ventures.

"Early-stage entrepreneurs tended to see more opportunities in the
pandemic, perhaps because they had more flexibility to pivot, than those
who had been operating their businesses for more than 42 months," she
adds.

But in terms of which start-ups create the most value, Ms Ionescu-
Somers notes that capital-intensive and those requiring more skilled
workers tend to pay better, and have the most potential to create jobs
and wealth in local economies.

"By their nature, tech start-ups have products and services that are
very much differentiated from other start-ups, so the barriers to entry
are high," she explains. "Easy entry

sectors generally have smaller margins and lower returns."

Location-based platforms But differentiation can come with profound
societal effects, as shown by the new workforce models pioneered by gig
economy start-ups. Ride-hailing apps, such as Uber and Lyft, and
on-demand delivery services, such as Deliveroo and DoorDash, have been
heavily criticised over job insecurity, low pay and a lack of rights for
workers on their platforms.

A 2021 analysis of 300 Deliveroo riders' invoices in the UK, conducted
by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, found that a third made on
average less than £8.27 per hour, which is less than the current UK
national minimum wage of £8.92 per hour for those under the age of 23.
Notably, one worker was logged in for 180 hours and was paid the
equivalent of just £2 per hour.

"With companies such as Uber and Deliveroo, a major barrier to them
being profitable would be if all of their workers are being paid for the
hours they are logged onto the app," explains Alex Wood, a sociologist
of work and employment, who has extensively researched the gig economy.

"The tech sector is a very individualised and competitive system," he
continues. "If you don't have much bargaining power, in theory you might
have more flexibility, but really your employer is just determining when
you work."

In several countries, regulators have stepped in to empower platform
workers. Deliveroo is reportedly considering pulling out of Spain, which
will become the first EU country to amend its laws on

August 12 to give gig economy workers employee rights, such as
collective bargaining.

Back in 2019, New York became the first US city to pass a minimum wage
for Uber and Lyft drivers, with other cities since trying to follow
suit.

On the other hand, the gig economy offers attractive employment
opportunities in developing countries. Statistical analysis by the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) indicates that app-based work
tends to pay higher than traditional sectors, ranging from 22% more in
Ukraine to 86% more in Ghana.

Failure rates While the value of the global startup economy is estimated
at almost $3tn, according to Startup Genome, an innovation policy and
research firm, about 90% of start-ups will fail in their lifetime.
Research suggests that significant revenue and job growth at a few
successful start-ups is substantially offset by these losses in other
firms.

A 2014 study of more than 158,000 start-ups across 10 countries
worldwide found that among those in their fifth year, total job
destruction - or the declines in headcount among retrenching companies -
accounted for 65% of all the new jobs created in that year.

Mr Canales points out that the well-known rate of start-up failure has
broader implications.

"We know that the employees who take personal risks together with the
start-up risks, probably need some future support finding their way
through the labour market again," he says.

Others question the whole notion of start-ups and entrepreneurship as
isolated forces for prosperity.

Daniel Isenberg, an active angel investor and professor of
entrepreneurship at Babson College, points out that economic complexity,
rather than a focus on early-stage companies yields more benefits.

"'Start-up ecosystems' is a misnomer," he exclaims. "To look at one
particular age of company, one particular financing model or one
particular segment is intrinsically a mistake."

Mr Isenberg argues in his book, 'Worthless, Impossible and Stupid: How
contrarian entrepreneurs create and capture extraordinary value', that
entrepreneurship is not defined by the age of a company, but rather the
value it creates.

"Public leaders have latched onto this notion of unicorns being some
proxy for growth. It's not - it's a proxy for concentrated shareholder
wealth," he says. Up until July 15 this year, 291 new unicorns were
created, according to Crunchbase, which is more than any other full year
on record.

Hypergrowth pushes outsourcing As private investors finance and push
start-ups to scale at a rapid pace, many companies look for tech talent
outside their locations base. Pleo, like many start-ups, has had to hire
software engineers internationally.

"You can build a globally successful company out of Denmark … and I
think it is important to have most of the workforce here," says Mr
Rindom. "But as a shareholder, I think we can build the company with a
workforce split across 20 different countries."

Scarcity of software engineers, in particular, means that some jobs and
economic benefits created by start-ups are in countries where talent is
available, rather than where the company was founded.

A study by the consultancy Korn Ferry found that the US tech sector
could lose out on $162bn worth of revenues annually unless it finds more
high-tech workers. On the flip side, Korn Ferry predicts India could
have a surplus of more than one million high-skilled tech workers by
2030.

Uma Rani, a senior economist at the ILO in Geneva who has researched
digital labour platforms, has tracked a rising trend of earlystage tech
businesses outsourcing work to developing countries.

"Start-ups sitting in the US or Europe have a lot of their labour com-

ing largely from developing countries in Asia, which are often
Englishspeaking, such as India, the Philippines and others," she
explains.

Workers in India are the largest suppliers of work on digital labour
platforms, such as Topcoder, accounting for more than a third of all
work completed in 2020, the majority of which was software development,
according to ILO data.

While software development and technology are the most sought skills of
remote workers on online labour platforms, with its share of total
outsourcing increasing from 39% in 2018 to 45% in 2020, the platforms
are often used for other more menial tasks.

Start-ups claiming to be powered by AI, for instance, often outsource
tasks to humans in developing countries, as they develop machine
learning programs to automate the process.

A 2019 study of more than 2800 AI-start-ups in Europe, conducted by
London-based MMC Ventures, found that 40% do not, in fact, use any AI.

Ms Rani contends that while tech start-ups can provide opportunities for
workers in developing countries through these onlinebased platforms,
there is often a lack of social protections and implementation of labour
standards for these workers.

"It is beneficial to have tech start-ups for local economies," she says.
"But tech start-ups should keep in mind that what they are creating
should be for the welfare

of all and not something that would lead to the worsening of situations
for workers."

Diversification over tech-focus While some governments often put intense
focus on promoting and supporting start-ups and the tech sector, experts
believe a more holistic approach is needed.

"At scale, having many entrepreneurs makes a huge societal difference,"
says Ms Ionescu-Somers. But a focus on technology alone will not
suffice.

"Societies need many entrepreneurs in all viable sectors," adds Ms
Ionescu-Somers. "Governments need to create the optimal environmental
conditions for individuals to start and grow a business."

This sentiment is echoed by Mr Isenberg, who believes that scaling up
businesses of all ages and sectors is far better than putting an overt
focus on start-ups and technology.

As part of the Babson Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Project (Beep) he set
up in 2010, Mr Isenberg has developed methods for using entrepreneurial
ecosystems as a tool for regional economic development.

One Beep initiative in the city of Manizales, Colombia, focused on
"quick wins", such as helping existing businesses to grow more rapidly
within months, instead of start-ups. This approach has paid off -
companies in Manizales that joined the 'Scalerator' programme saw an
average 55% increase in sales growth

within a year of joining and made 703 new hires.

Positive intent While start-ups and entrepreneurship can lead to the
creation of economic and social value, their unintended consequences can
also have a pernicious effect. And with venture capitalists making
increasingly large investments into tech companies, pushing them to
scale rapidly at the expense of the communities they purport to serve,
this phenomenon looks likely to stay.

For economic developers looking to start-ups and entrepreneurial
ecosystems to stimulate economic growth and local opportunity, an
awareness of this infatuation with tech-enabled businesses - and its
pitfalls - will be crucial.

For Ms Hayes, the question of whether tech start-ups and VC are forces
for good boils down to whether there is social and environmental purpose
embedded into their mission from the outset.

"If there was good intention, ideally that will manifest in how that
business grows and scales, and the value it creates for other people,"
she says. ¦

Triple Chasm helps start-ups make the leap to SME success

Cambridge Independent

March 9, 2022

Could the incredibly high rate of start-up failures - a strike rate of
92 per cent globally after three years - be reduced?

If it was halved that would deliver an economic transformation - and
Triple Chasm believes that could be achieved thanks to its SME platform.
Along the way, of course, it aims to ensure it's one of the prospering 8
per cent as it boosts viability in the unnecessarily brutal economic
cull which deprives people of services and products which could and
perhaps should be economically viable.

The start-up, which was incorporated in April 2020, is the brainchild of
Uday Phadke, and co-founders Sam Dods, COO, Tony Hart, CRO, Shai
Vyakarnam ('chief evangelist'), Arun Muthirulan, CSO, and James Parton,
CMO.

"The common link between all of us is that we've all been part of the
Cambridge eco-system of innovation for the last 10 years, and Tony Hart
has been doing the same thing in Oxford," says Uday, speaking from his
base in Thriplow.

"My focus has mainly been on healthcare and wellbeing, agrifood and
biotech... I set up a research company in Cambridge in 2010 looking at
how innovation companies start and grow - I published two books, as
co-author [Camels, Tigers & Unicorns with Shailendra Vyakarnam, and The
Scale-Up Manual]. The idea is to turn these research insights into
tools."

The triple chasm, by the way, is a reference to the discovery by
Cartezia, which Uday founded in 1998. The model was developed on the
basis of real world data from more than 3,000 global companies. It
identifies three crucial stages where start-ups are most likely to
fail - the transition from concept to demonstrator, demonstrator to
early product, and early products to volume products.

"In our experience," say the researchers, "most market failures do not
occur because of problems with technology, management or funding, but
arise from the failure of companies to recognise where they are in this
development cycle and understanding the different skills and resources
required to cross

each chasm."

Uday adds: "These three plateaus or hurdles are all crossed by companies
on their growth journey, although the time frame for each sector might
be different - for pharma it might be five to 15 years."

When it came to designing a service to enable companies to successfully
hurdle the challenges, Triple Chasm has identified three customer
sectors.

"The tools and platforms we provide services to are firstly companies,
secondly some of the innovation agencies and thirdly investors."

Innovation agencies include organisations like Innovate UK, which
invests in promising high-growth scale-ups.

Triple Chasm already has partnerships with EIT Food and EAHSN (Eastern
Academic Health Science Network).

"We build strategic partnerships for the long term," Uday continues.
"We've also worked with high-tech companies in Finland and in Austria,
where Hermann Hauser runs a set of intervention programmes to bring the
Tyrol into the global market. And we work with a federal government
agency and investment agencies across India, plus we have a partnership
with Cambridge Cleantech - we've extended the Triple Chasm model to
include sustainability. We do a lot of work on EV charging and EV
design.

"We're trying to turn the seed corns essential to transform the world,
so they don't die and are useful for the planet and the people of the
planet, that's our mindset."

So why do so many businesses fail as they try to scale?

"They fail because they can't figure out their business model, how
they're going to make money," replies Uday. "The UK has a very strong
science space which is not being supported by commercialisation except
in a

few sectors.

"The economic value generation system is broken globally. Sure, there's
lots of arm-waving, but if you just look at how the industrial strategy
for the UK has been reinvented three or four times [this century], you
can see we can do better.

"The failure rate [92 per cent] is global, it's the same in Silicon
Valley. Our data is global and includes China, India, Europe, South
America, Cuba...

"If we could halve the failure rate, that would be incredible. Even a 10
or 20 per cent reduction would be a huge achievement - that's an
aspiration; we've no evidence for that at this stage, it's going to take
seven to

10 years.

"In that time our company will grow: we have lots of deep expertise and
experience."

Strategies For Promoting Entrepreneurship And Creating Student Start-Ups

Perspective

Entrepreneur is an individual who bears the risk of operating business
in the face of uncertainty about the future conditions. Whereas
entrepreneurship is a philosophy or process through which an
entrepreneur seeks innovation and employment. It is the process of
creating something different with value by devoting the necessary time
and effort, assuming the accompanying financial, psychic, social risks
and receiving the resulting rewards of monetary and personal
satisfaction and independence.

Entrepreneurship is one of the increasingly popular fields in today's
evolving business scene. Entrepreneurs are frequently thought of as
national assets to be cultivated, motivated, and remunerated to the
greatest possible extent. Understanding the basics of entrepreneurship
and innovation can position students to succeed in today's dynamic
market. It can also benefit students to cultivate unique skills and
enable them to think outside the box. Identifying the strategies for
entrepreneurship can help the students to gain the skills, confidence,
and competitive edge needed to succeed in an ever-changing business
landscape. Moreover, it ensures social justice and stimulates the
economy.

Do you know?

Entrepreneurial spirit of people is greatly responsible for economic
development of any country. There is no resource including diamond mines
as valuable as human resource. South Africa and a few other African
countries despite their fertile gold and diamond mines have remained
poor/relatively poor, where as Japan with literally no natural resources
and having suffered devastation during WW-II became a developed country
in just three decades. Therefore, if a country allows its human
resources to be unutilized/underutilized (unemployment/disguised
unemployment), its economic development would be severely hampered.

What is out understanding?

There are several ways to explore the subject. In a query driven world,
the best way is to explore via counter intuitive questions. In a
globally connected and hyper competitive world, where the opportunities
are just not local, the challenges may be unique at one site, but may
draw in similarities from global experiences. As authors we draw a
common narration on queries.

The key questions which may be explored from the above theme are as
follows:

1. What are the different skills required by an entrepreneur to be
successful?

2. What challenges may occur while establishing start-ups and how to
deal with them?

3. How can learning entrepreneurship will help the students to start
their own set-ups?

4. What are the various strategies for promoting entrepreneurship in
India?

What we see?

In view of the rising tendency among student community to take up
executive jobs rather than pursuing entrepreneurship, there are several
dimensions that may encourage students and promote entrepreneurship
among students, especially in post pandemic situation.

Some pull factors of entrepreneurship are perception of advantages where
a person feels that he can earn better in terms of overall gains like
money, status, security, future, etc. As an entrepreneur these are
better than working as an employee, while spotting an opportunity and
exploit for larger gains.

The eco-system in India is progressively supportive for entrepreneurial
ventures. The rising success of new age start-ups with institutional
support lie infrastructure, business incubators, seed funding, angel
funding and venture capitalists can be witnessed. These have started
setting in newer opportunities that can be exploited by the incumbent
entrepreneurs.

Some of the push factors are job dissatisfaction, layoffs, retirement
and boredom as an employee.

There are vital provisions by National Innovation and Start Up Policy
2020 for the benefit of students, aspiring to be an entrepreneur. The
question is how to motivate students to go for entrepreneurial ventures
considering the risks involved? The response is education and training
with hand holding by e-cells and incubation centres.

Outlook

Entrepreneurship is the need of the hour and there cannot be better than
the present time. In this context the educational institutions must
gear-up. Their system must balance curriculum to enhance students'
participation in entrepreneurial activities. There is a much need to
influence the entrepreneurial mindset, the idea of infusing
entrepreneurship into education, women entrepreneurship and start-up
creation. It takes immense persuasion and resilience to be a successful
entrepreneur, while making a difference in lives of others. There is a
power of passion in the entrepreneurial journey and the consensus is
that any business with clear goals and steps can only reach the set
goals. Early start-up failures from others can provide tips to the
students to succeed in the long run. Regarding the opportunity
identification, industry trends, insights and thinking out-of-the-box
become a critical to setting up an enterprise.

Success rate of startups in India higher than in rest of the world,
Piyush Goyal tells Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: The success rate of startups in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world and there were 84,012 recognised startups in
the country at the end of November, Union minister Piyush Goyal told Lok
Sabha on Wednesday."Startups are prone to failures is a very high
probability. Though I must say, the success rate of startups in India is
relatively higher than the rest of the world...," the minister said,
adding that the number of recognised startups has increased from 452 in
2016 to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022.Goyal's detailed response to
queries on India's start-up ecosystem, however, led to some sharp
exchanges between the opposition and treasury benches, especially after
Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's objected to Goyal's "political statement"
instead of pithy responses to members' questions. Chowdhury also
objected to Goyal refusing to acknowledge the Congress government's role
in setting up the premier IITs, which he said hosts one of the country's
most successful start-up incubators.

"The Incubation Centre in IIT Madras is doing such a phenomenal work
that in a short span of time the start-ups that have been created at
that centre have a combined valuation of over Rs 30,000 crore. Today,
they have built 12 lakh square feet of area in which they have provided
some of the most modern equipment," Goyal had said. Earlier, Congress MP
Manish Tewari asked the government what was it doing to ensure that
start-ups can graduate to Unicorn status quickly. Tewari also pointed
out that on a scale of the valuation of start-ups, India did not rank
among the first 10 or first 15 start-ups, globally. Goyal, however,
countered Tewari and said that the start up ecosystem in India and
countries like USA could not be compared because they had started
earlier in contrast to India. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Why start-ups come to a stop

Dataquest

India's start-up ecosystem is booming. Policy framework is encouraging
too. Then why aren't there any Indian Googles and Apples? Here is a
clear-eyed analysis.

The Indian start-up ecosystem seems to have everything going for it -
great ideas, latest technologies, policy support and, most importantly,
investor funding. Then why is it that many start-ups are not able to
make it beyond the first year of operations? Even among the ones that
somehow manage to stay afloat, more than two-thirds close down within
five years.

In the last few years, in particular, we have seen the launch of so many
initiativesfocused on start-ups, like Start-up India, Make in India and
Skill India, among others. Industry bodies like Nasscom are working
closely with the government to create and promote a culture of
entrepreneurship. According to a Nasscom report, India saw the emergence
of over 1,600 tech start-ups and a record 12 unicorns in 2020, which is
the highest ever added in a single calendar year.

Even COVID-19 has not deterred the growth of start-ups, says the
industry body. On the contrary, it has accelerated digital adoption and
the shift to online, thereby creating new opportunities for tech
start-ups.There is significant momentum in the deep-techspace with
increased interest from funding agencies to invest in such start-ups,
states the report.

So, why are all these opportunities not being translated into successful
businesses? What are the reasons behind the failure of so many
start-ups?

Lack of entrepreneurial skills

Great ideas have the potential to build great organisations, but they
also need great leaders with entrepreneurial skills and business acumen
to steer them in the right direction. Steve Jobs may have started Apple
in his twenties, but it achieved success much later when he was in his
forties and had a strong team backing him.

Too much hype has been built around the 20-something whizkids creating
path-breaking companies. In reality, many of these youngsters who start
with a big bang are not able to sustain themselves in the long run.
Building a successful organisation requires visionary leaders with
ability to manage sales and marketing, finance, logistics and
administration among other essential business skills.

Steve Jobs may have started Apple in his twenties, but it achieved
success much later when he was in his forties and had a strong team
backing him.

Innovation and uniqueness

Despite all the success that Indian IT has seen on the global front,
there are hardly any breakthrough products or cutting-edge technologies
that Indianstart-ups can boast of.Indian has not been able to create
companies of the stature of Google or Microsoft and even the successful
ones have emulated existing global ventures, the most prominent among
them being Flipkart for Amazon.Indian techies might have done well while
working for multinational companies and have even risen to leadership
positions, but they seem lacking when it comes to building new companies
of their own.

A study conducted by IBM and Oxford Economics finds that 90% of Indian
start-ups fail within the first five years and the most common reason
for failure is lack of innovation. As many as 77% of venture capitalists
surveyed believe that Indian start-ups lack new technologies or unique
business models.The true spirit of innovation requires start-up leaders
to take bold decisions, create new business models and develop truly
unique products with a long-term vision to succeed in the market.

Market understanding

A number of 'wannabe' entrepreneurs get into business without a clear
understanding of what they plan to do. Many of them are young and
inexperienced, and do not realise the importance of market research and
its role in assessing the viability of a new product or service before
it is launched. As a result, even the most innovative products come
crashing down if the market does not need them.

A proper market assessment exercise is not only useful to understand the
needs of the customers, but also helps in market positioning and brand
promotion.A competitive analysis of existing products must be conducted
to understand their strengths and weaknesses. All these factors help in
deciding the focus and scope of a new product.

Buzzwords and the hype

The reason for failure does not lie solely in the hands of the
entrepreneur; at times even investors get caught in the hype around
certain technologies. Start-ups in desperate need of funding often rely
on buzzwords and trending technologies to attract venture capitalists.
Most of these VCs come from a finance or consulting background and are
not able to assess the commercial viability of complex technologies. As
a result, they usually get taken in by the founder's confidence or
ability to weave a convincing narrative around his or her product.

Nasscom figures validate the fact that investments in deep-tech like
artificial intelligence or machine learning have steadily increased over
the last few years. According to its report, 14% of total investments in
2020 were in deep-tech start-ups, up from 11% in 2019. Further, 87% of
all deep-tech investments were in AI/ML start-ups, in 2020. In another
global study conducted last year, it was found that two in five 'AI
start-ups' actually have no AI. Among other buzzwords, quantum
computing, robotic automation, and blockchain have also been often
misused and exaggerated by start-up founders.

An IBM-Oxford Economics study finds that 90% of Indian start-ups fail
within the first five years and the most common reason for failure is
lack of innovation.

Cashflow management

This is the most commonly cited reason for the failure of start-ups.
Start-ups often face cash flow problems if the stipulated targets are
not achieved or returns take time to come for various reasons. According
to a study conducted by a US bank, 82% of the time, poor cash flow
management or poor understanding of cash flow contributes to the failure
of a small business.

Many entrepreneurs end up investing a lot of money in setting up swanky
offices or big marketing and advertising campaigns to create a buzz
around their products. Having spent a large part of their given funds in
the initial phase itself, they often have to struggle with cash flow
issues in the later stages. Entrepreneurs who adopt a more balanced
approach in managing their resources are usually able to sustain
themselves in the long term.

A start-up needs to have a realistic business plan and strategy, with
achievable goals clearly outlined at the beginning itself. Otherwise,
after the initial euphoria dies out, even the investors may start losing
interest. If the company does not deliver on its value proposition, the
investors can even decide to pull out, leaving the company gasping for
breath.

What's behind the failure of most startups?

The Economic Times

Every year, countless startups are launched, but only a very small
percentage actually survive to become profitable. Studies show that only
20% of startups are able to survive for more than 5 years and only 8%
manage to survive beyond 10 years. Clearly the odds are stacked against
a new startup founder.Why do so many startups fail? What are some of the
pitfalls which founders can avoid?

And, what are some of the common mistakes that founders make?BrandingAs
crazy as it sounds, some founders suffer from a love-sickness for an
excessive spend on branding. But here's the thing - customers care more
about what the startup can do for them! So, the founder needs to shift
focus to value-building and getting the product to the market and
postpone the high brand spend to a future date. No startup has an
infinite marketing budget, and money needs to be spent wisely. The
product needs to be in front of users as quickly as possible, so they
can provide feedback that can be used to improve the
product.SalesRevenues don't flow automatically into a startup. Founders
need to connect with customers, convince them to buy their products and
also discover the pain points encountered. The new science of
"product-led marketing" is often misinterpreted to mean that launching a
great product leads to a wave of sales. It requires a business strategy
that applies product-led principles to the marketing function and puts
the product at the centre of customer experience. Founders also need to
be the startup's first salesperson and the face of the company, talking
to potential customers face to face, convince them about the product.You
can't do it aloneFounders need to have a great team to execute on the
vision and deliver products as quickly and reliably as possible. A good
co-founder can prove critical. Hiring the right people with the right
complementary skills to deliver the business objectives has to be done
deliberately and purposefully.ProductAfter the excitement of launching a
new product, founders need to continue listening to users and adjust the
product to meet their needs. It is the users who are ultimately
responsible for the success or failure of the product.Founders should
always start by asking themselves the following two questions: What
problem does my product solve? Do I have a solution for my users that is
different from what already exists on the market? If your answer to
these questions is "yes", then the startup is probably on the right
track. This will also mean figuring out what features are absolutely
necessary for the product when it is launched and what can be added in
due course.Burn"Have money, burn it!" Ouch! Those cowboy days are over.
As investors closely monitor the spend, a startup is expected to take
prudent steps to ensure the sustainability of the business, growing at a
controlled pace without using cash reserves too quickly and with a
disciplined approach to track costs. An investor wants to see traction
and not just big ideas or nice charts!AwardsRecognition from peers and
the industry is always motivating to any entrepreneur. Gaining the
awards that are genuine and ones that give good exposure and platform
for the startups to grow their network and their business is crucial.
Founders need to be mindful of awards that are offered in exchange for
sponsorships. They may seem like a great idea but in reality, they can
often lead to more harm than good.FundingOnce a startup gets
investments, the arduous task of building a scalable business model
starts. This is the ammunition that triggers building of efficient sales
and distribution channels and delivering an exceptional customer
experience across touch points. It calls for hiring a team that can
deliver on the promises. Getting funded is an important landmark but can
never be considered as a sign of success.Building a successful startup
requires time, hard work and perseverance, not just luck or magic. It
requires patience and a lot of focus. Keeping a long-term perspective in
mind and being invested in it for the long run is critical. This is a
marathon and not a sprint. Ultimately, avoiding some of the common fatal
mistakes can only improve the chances of success for you as a startup
founder.(The author, Ninad Karpe, is the founder and partner at 100x.vc)

Start-Ups Get to Right Unit Economics Within 3-4 Years Incorporation,
Says Vidur Vyas of NorthSide

Franchising World

November 23 -- Last three years have changed a lot of things for
start-ups. These three years turned many of the start-ups into unicorn
while many more were forced to shut. Some people say money is the issue,
behind failure of start-ups, lack of planning say others. Apart from
these, a number of things like proper guidance, credibility of ideas and
proper marketing are some largely accepted things responsible for making
or breaking any business.

As the number start-ups have been seen rising, government has started a
number of incubator programmes to help them. Various business have also
came in this sector while help another businesses to grow. To understand
how this realme has been transforming, we talked Vidur Vyas, Founder and
Chief Executive Officer of NorthSide.

-   How can NorthSide help in taking an idea to execution? 

NorthSide has a venture incubator where ideas are taken to the launch
stage by providing insights, market mapping, positioning development,
creative asset development, D2C and e-commerce scale-up, all under one
roof.

The NorthSide venture incubator is run by an expert team with over 20+
years of experience in scaling brands and launching successful
innovations. The team is a mix of entrepreneurs and former CXOs of large
corporations, creative directors, and digital and e-commerce experts
that work with software-based solutions that help in taking the idea to
the launch stage, and if needed, scale it up further.

-   What are the Dos and Don'ts in a startup culture or MSMEs?

Startups and MSMEs need to be careful with their capital and put it to
good use.

One of the most important things is developing your customer value
proposition using experts. At a broad level, the product or service
offered by the startup can be better, cheaper or faster. Identifying the
winning value proposition is the most important investment a startup can
make.

At NorthSide, we believe in validating the proposition with a small
investment first, before making more investment. This prevents pivoting
later, which is more expensive and does not help the company in the long
run.

 

-   What are the must-haves to run a startup or MSMEs?

The startup must think in terms of building expertise & using a
validated viable product or service to raise capital.

While capital is easier to get, startups need to invest behind expertise
by hiring the right talent or using consultants in the initial stages to
set up the right processes and systems.

 

-   How to run a profitable startup or MSME?

Start-up companies need to think about their business model and
profitability from day zero. Many companies make the mistake of thinking
that the business model will improve with scale even when the unit
economics are not right. Good start-ups are usually able to get to the
right unit economics within 3-4 years of starting up. Another important
thing is to invest behind marketing- building and communicating your
value proposition to acquire and retain customers. For this companies
should think behind investing in technology and using it to scale up
their proposition.

NorthSide's Brand Builder program helps in finding the right customer
value proposition and positioning the brand in a competitive context. In
the last 4 years, two companies that have worked with NorthSide have won
the National Start-up award, some have got funded with investment rounds
and many have experienced revenue growth of up to 40X.

-   How to keep thriving in the competitive marketplace and what are the
      key learnings you should be mindful of?

At NorthSide, we encourage brands to do three things well to win in the
marketplace

-   Get the price benefit segment of your brand right and try and
      maximise customer acquisition within the segment.

Often brands try and play with discounts to get to a customer segment,
which is unsustainable in the long run. Instead of doing that, investing
behind various forms of advertising and developing is always a connected
strategy.

-   Build your brand image by responding to customer feedback

Responding to customer feedback is vital. It shows that a company cares
and is also an important tool to get insights. Often brands do not have
processes in place where they listen effectively as a result they miss
out on opportunities to earn consumer respect and opportunities to
innovate.

-   Winning in the marketplace model in the long run is difficult unless
      the MRP of the brand is above Rs. 300/-.

This is because of the margins and cost of delivery. Brands should
therefore build out their own D2C model alongside and think in terms of
a hybrid model to reach selected stores offline.

 

-   How and when to expand your start-up?

Start-up brands need to find the right time to expand. Expanding early,
without establishing the core proposition, results in dilution while
expanding late can leave revenue opportunities on the table.

At NorthSide, we believe that brands should expand once their repeat
customer rate crosses a quantified threshold and the unit economics from
their first geography is favourable. Expanding before achieving both is
dilutive.

 

-   How should a brand position itself in different channels?

Using consistent brand visuals across channels is important to get
consistent brand positioning. At NorthSide, we do this by developing one
key visual, which helps position the product in a competitive context
and then adapt that image for use across channels.

-   How far the startup culture has come and what does it need to
      succeed?

Any business is about the final consumer. A startup culture must capture
this fully and we therefore believe that a startup must have consumer
-centricity at the core of its culture. Another important thing is to
have a culture where investors' money is treated like your own money-
ethics and integrity are a must.

Success rate of startups in India higher than in rest of the world,
Goyal tells LS

New Delhi: The success rate of startups in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world and there were 84,012 recognised startups in
the country at the end of November, Union minister Piyush Goyal told Lok
Sabha on Wednesday. “Startups are prone to failures is a very high
probability. Though I must say, the success rate of startups in India is
relatively higher than the rest of the world...,” the minister said,
adding that the number of recognised startups has increased from 452 in
2016 to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022. Goyal's detailed response to
queries on India's start-up ecosystem, however, led to some sharp
exchanges between the opposition and treasury benches, especially after
Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's objected to Goyal's “political statement”
instead of pithy responses to members' questions.

Chowdhury also objected to Goyal refusing to acknowledge the Congress
government's role in setting up the premier IITs, which he said hosts
one of the country's most successful start-up incubators. “The
Incubation Centre in IIT Madras is doing such a phenomenal work that in
a short span of time the startups that have been created at that centre
have a combined valuation of over Rs 30,000 crore. Today, they have
built 12 lakh square feet of area in which they have provided some of
the most modern equipment,” Goyal had said. Earlier, Congress MP Manish
Tewari asked the government what was it doing to ensure that start-ups
can graduate to Unicorn status quickly. Tewari also pointed out that on
a scale of the valuation of start-ups, India did not rank among the
first 10 or first 15 start-ups, globally. Goyal, however, countered
Tewari and said that the start up ecosystem in India and countries like
USA could not be compared because they had started earlier in contrast
to India.

India, June 23 -- India's start-up ecosystem is booming. Policy
framework is encouraging too. Then why aren't there any Indian Googles
and Apples? Here is a clear-eyed analysis.

By Shweta Verma

The Indian start-up ecosystem seems to have everything going for it -
great ideas, latest technologies, policy support and, most importantly,
investor funding. Then why is it that many start-ups are not able to
make it beyond the first year of operations? Even among the ones that
somehow manage to stay afloat, more than two-thirds close down within
five years.

In the last few years, in particular, we have seen the launch of so many
initiativesfocused on start-ups, like Start-up India, Make in India and
Skill India, among others. Industry bodies like Nasscom are working
closely with the government to create and promote a culture of
entrepreneurship. According to a Nasscom report, India saw the emergence
of over 1,600 tech start-ups and a record 12 unicorns in 2020, which is
the highest ever added in a single calendar year.

Even COVID-19 has not deterred the growth of start-ups, says the
industry body. On the contrary, it has accelerated digital adoption and
the shift to online, thereby creating new opportunities for tech
start-ups.There is significant momentum in the deep-techspace with
increased interest from funding agencies to invest in such start-ups,
states the report.

So, why are all these opportunities not being translated into successful
businesses? What are the reasons behind the failure of so many
start-ups?

Lack of entrepreneurial skills

Great ideas have the potential to build great organisations, but they
also need great leaders with entrepreneurial skills and business acumen
to steer them in the right direction. Steve Jobs may have started Apple
in his twenties, but it achieved success much later when he was in his
forties and had a strong team backing him.

Too much hype has been built around the 20-something whizkids creating
path-breaking companies. In reality, many of these youngsters who start
with a big bang are not able to sustain themselves in the long run.
Building a successful organisation requires visionary leaders with
ability to manage sales and marketing, finance, logistics and
administration among other essential business skills.

Innovation and uniqueness

Despite all the success that Indian IT has seen on the global front,
there are hardly any breakthrough products or cutting-edge technologies
that Indianstart-ups can boast of.Indian has not been able to create
companies of the stature of Google or Microsoft and even the successful
ones have emulated existing global ventures, the most prominent among
them being Flipkart for Amazon.Indian techies might have done well while
working for multinational companies and have even risen to leadership
positions, but they seem lacking when it comes to building new companies
of their own.

A study conducted by IBM and Oxford Economics finds that 90% of Indian
start-ups fail within the first five years and the most common reason
for failure is lack of innovation. As many as 77% of venture capitalists
surveyed believe that Indian start-ups lack new technologies or unique
business models.The true spirit of innovation requires start-up leaders
to take bold decisions, create new business models and develop truly
unique products with a long-term vision to succeed in the market.

Market understanding

A number of 'wannabe' entrepreneurs get into business without a clear
understanding of what they plan to do. Many of them are young and
inexperienced, and do not realise the importance of market research and
its role in assessing the viability of a new product or service before
it is launched. As a result, even the most innovative products come
crashing down if the market does not need them.

A proper market assessment exercise is not only useful to understand the
needs of the customers, but also helps in market positioning and brand
promotion.A competitive analysis of existing products must be conducted
to understand their strengths and weaknesses. All these factors help in
deciding the focus and scope of a new product.

Buzzwords and the hype

The reason for failure does not lie solely in the hands of the
entrepreneur; at times even investors get caught in the hype around
certain technologies. Start-ups in desperate need of funding often rely
on buzzwords and trending technologies to attract venture capitalists.
Most of these VCs come from a finance or consulting background and are
not able to assess the commercial viability of complex technologies. As
a result, they usually get taken in by the founder's confidence or
ability to weave a convincing narrative around his or her product.

Nasscom figures validate the fact that investments in deep-tech like
artificial intelligence or machine learning have steadily increased over
the last few years. According to its report, 14% of total investments in
2020 were in deep-tech start-ups, up from 11% in 2019. Further, 87% of
all deep-tech investments were in AI/ML start-ups, in 2020. In another
global study conducted last year, it was found that two in five 'AI
start-ups' actually have no AI. Among other buzzwords, quantum
computing, robotic automation, and blockchain have also been often
misused and exaggerated by start-up founders.

Cashflow management

This is the most commonly cited reason for the failure of start-ups.
Start-ups often face cash flow problems if the stipulated targets are
not achieved or returns take time to come for various reasons. According
to a study conducted by a US bank, 82% of the time, poor cash flow
management or poor understanding of cash flow contributes to the failure
of a small business.

Many entrepreneurs end up investing a lot of money in setting up swanky
offices or big marketing and advertising campaigns to create a buzz
around their products. Having spent a large part of their given funds in
the initial phase itself, they often have to struggle with cash flow
issues in the later stages. Entrepreneurs who adopt a more balanced
approach in managing their resources are usually able to sustain
themselves in the long term.

A start-up needs to have a realistic business plan and strategy, with
achievable goals clearly outlined at the beginning itself. Otherwise,
after the initial euphoria dies out, even the investors may start losing
interest. If the company does not deliver on its value proposition, the
investors can even decide to pull out, leaving the company gasping for
breath.

From protective coatings to stop water evaporating to farmer-driven
eco-movements. How start-ups are combating drought

Impact News Service

Cologny: World Economic Forum has issued the following press release:

Drought could affect more than 75% of the world ’ s population by 2050,
the UN estimates.Record temperatures have led to the worst drought in
Europe in 500 years, while 36 million people face food insecurity in the
Horn of Africa due to crop failure.Several start-ups are helping to
tackle drought in Chile, Niger and India.Finding ways to combat drought
is more pressing than ever: droughts may affect three-quarters of the
world ’ s population by 2050, the UN estimates. And they are increasing
in frequency and severity, with the number and duration up 29% since
2000.

Water scarcity brings with it crop failure, wildfires, the prospects of
starvation and mass migration. Droughts, storms and floods, could cost
the global economy $5.6 trillion by 2050, engineering consultancy GHD
says in its Aquanomics report.

Summer 2022 brought record temperatures to typically more moderate
climates in the northern hemisphere, leading to Europe ’ s worst drought
in 500 years, ruining crops and driving up food prices.

Europe has just faced its worst drought in 500 years. Image: European
Space AgencyMore than 36 million people are facing food insecurity in
the Horn of Africa after the worst drought in more than 40 years.

How 3 start-ups are tackling droughts in their neighborhoodWhile
governments from the northern and southern hemispheres are coming
together to fight the impact of water scarcity, several start-ups are
trying to halt the impact in their local areas.

Here are three of them:

1. Stopping Chile ’ s reservoirs from drying out

Chile has been fighting drought for 13 years and its reservoirs are
drying up. The o2 Company has developed a solution to stop water
evaporating. Image: o2 CompanyChile has been fighting drought for 13
years and its reservoirs are drying up.

One start-up trying to help farmers in particular is the o2 Company. It
has developed a liquid mix of polymers and alcohol that can be poured
onto water to stop it from evaporating. This protective layer on the
water surface cuts the rate of evaporation by 50-80%, saving hundreds of
thousands of gallons of water a month, according to o2.

“To me evaporation seemed like the obvious place to start,” founder
Carlos Korner told Time earlier this year. The former publicist reached
out to a chemist in 2018 to help him develop a product that could help
combat Chile ’ s water scarcity. The firm now has 25 clients in the
country, mostly farms, vineyards and mining companies.

2. Amman Imman – Bringing water and life back to Azawak

Amman Imman is working to improve water supply and tackle drought in
Niger. Image: Amman ImmanIn 2005, Amman Imman founder Ariane Kirtley
travelled to the pastoral region of the Azawak, Niger, as a Fulbright
Scholar. There, she saw children travelling up to 30 miles a day in the
search of water, often in vain.

Her company ’ s latest project is the Landscape Restoration for
Ecosystem Recovery, through which the non-profit organisation is aiming
to restore watersheds, rebuild pasture lands and promote agroforestry in
the Azwak region.

By restoring these habitats, it hopes to replenish soils, be able to
catch and stock rainwater, and enable more sustainable food production.
It also runs an international schools programme that educates students
about climate change and Africa ’ s Great Green Wall Initiative.

3. Replenishing India ’ s Cauvery River

The Kaveri River (also known as the Cauvery) is a lifeline for southern
India, supplying cities such as Bangalore and Chennai. Like almost all
rivers in India, it is forest-fed. Historically, the region where the
Cauvery runs was covered in trees, meaning the soil was constantly
replenished and the river remained fed.

However, as the forests disappear the river is drying up, and this is
taking a toll on local farmers, who are facing failed harvests and
crippling debt.

The Isha Foundation ’ s Cauvery Calling campaign aims to enable 5.2
million farmers to plant 2.42 billion trees over 12 years along the
river's 1-kilometre wide area to replenish water levels and the
groundwater table.

Launched in July 2019, Cauvery Calling is the world ’ s largest
farmer-driven eco-movement.

Success rate of startups in India higher than rest of world: Goyal

New Delhi: The success rate of startups in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world and there were 84,012 recognised startups in
the country at the end of November, Union minister Piyush Goyal told Lok
Sabha on Wednesday. “Startups are prone to failures is a very high
probability. Though I must say, the success rate of startups in India is
relatively higher than the rest of the world...,” the minister said,
adding that the number of recognised startups has increased from 452 in
2016 to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022. Goyal's detailed response to
queries on India's start-up ecosystem, however, led to some sharp
exchanges between the opposition and treasury benches, especially after
Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's objected to Goyal's “political statement”
instead of pithy responses to members' questions.

Chowdhury also objected to Goyal refusing to acknowledge the Congress
government's role in setting up the premier IITs, which he said hosts
one of the country's most successful start-up incubators. “The
Incubation Centre in IIT Madras is doing such a phenomenal work that in
a short span of time the startups that have been created at that centre
have a combined valuation of over Rs 30,000 crore. Today, they have
built 12 lakh square feet of area in which they have provided some of
the most modern equipment,” Goyal had said. Earlier, Congress MP Manish
Tewari asked the government what was it doing to ensure that start-ups
can graduate to Unicorn status quickly. Tewari also pointed out that on
a scale of the valuation of start-ups, India did not rank among the
first 10 or first 15 start-ups, globally. Goyal, however, countered
Tewari and said that the start up ecosystem in India and countries like
USA could not be compared because they had started earlier in contrast
to India. The number of recognised startups has increased from 452 in
2016 to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022

Apparel industry experts investing within the industry

Apparel Resources

September 17, 2022 Saturday 6:30 AM EST

Contify.com All Rights Reserved

Length: 1156 words

Byline: Dheeraj Tagra

Body

In India's apparel and textile industry, start-ups are strongly present
across many segments and dominate in B2B, B2C marketplaces and D2C
brands. These small to giant start-ups get funding of millions of
dollars from global venture capital firms as well as Indian investors.
Interestingly, there are a few angel investors who have deep
understanding and involvement in apparel manufacturing and retail.
Vineet Gautam, CEO, Bestseller India; Ananth Narayanan, Founder, Mensa
Brands; Anand S Ahuja, MD, Shahi Exports; Pallak Seth, Founder and Vice
Chairman, PDS Limited and Neeraj Goenka, Director, Texport Industries
are a few of them. Apart from funding, the guidance of investors is also
highly important for the start-ups and it is here that these
sector-specific experts add extra value to the start-ups with their
know-how, experience, network and overall understanding of the apparel
trade.

Funding to variety of start-ups

As far as funding by the apparel industry stalwarts is concerned,
several start-ups have been benefited by them. Vineet Gautam, a retail
virtuoso, has invested in B2B marketplace Groyyo and luxury fashion
omnichannel e-commerce platform Purple Style Labs. Anand S Ahuja and his
wife Sonam Kapoor Ahuja (having own fashion brand Rheson) support the
leading marketplace Fashinza. Pallak, an angel investor since 2010,
loves supporting ambitious founders in solving market frictions and
leveraging technology as an angel investor alongside trusted partners.
He has co-invested alongside Sequoia Capital, Sierra Ventures, Social
Capital, Storm Ventures, Sherpa Ventures, etc., and helped entrepreneurs
through customer, co-investor and partner introductions.

Push to invest in start-ups

Investment in start-ups is naturally the preferred choice by the apparel
industry-based stalwarts as platforms like Fashinza and Groyyo have
gained momentum due to Covid disruptions, and with strong tech-base, the
future is definitely of B2B marketplaces. People's thrust on
sustainability increases the scope of renting platforms for designerwear
Stage 3 while luxury business and that through omnichannel is normally
growth-oriented. Rapid growth of start-ups like Purple Style Labs
achieving 50x growth in the last 4 years is further motivating the
industry stalwarts to invest in them. Overall from bootstrap to various
rounds of funding, the performance of start-ups and their execution of
an idea is a significant aspect for investors.

Anand's prominent investment areas are internet marketplace and
e-commerce but at the same time, he is a vocal supporter of sustainable
fashion. His funding to Fashinza exemplifies his support to marketplace
and sustainability as Fashinza claims to take every step to diminish its
impact on the society and environment. Its partners are encouraged to
use sustainable fabrics produced without the use of harmful chemicals.

Another leading person of the industry who is also an investor is Neeraj
Goenka, Director, Texport Industries and Co-founder of The Robert Graham
brand. Having good exposure to apparel export as well as international
retail, Neeraj has invested in five start-ups of the apparel domain. D2C
brand aggregator GOAT Brand Labs, Threadsole (acquired by Coats)
software solutions are a few of them.

"All five start-ups related to apparel industry to whom I have funded
are doing well. I am very bullish about start-ups in the apparel sector
and especially the B2C segment as I believe that B2B is comparatively a
difficult category and B2C has more scope. For me to invest in any
start-up, the most important thing is a product. It has to be appealing
as well as should be for masses and scalable," says Neeraj who also
remained in the board of Venture Nursery (VN), India's first
angel-backed start-up accelerator. He is also a member of Indian Angel
Network since 2013.

Value added by apparel industry experts

Funding to early-stage start-ups allows an investor to reap maximum
benefits from a start-up's ideas. Unique ideas with innovative answers
to real-world issues, product uniqueness, market opportunities and
scalability are some of the core areas for an investor. Along with all
these aspects, team and overall management of start-up is also highly
important.

And against the investment in start-up, on an average, investors hope to
get at least five times (normally in 3-5 years) of what they have
invested. Investors take a higher risk when making the decision to
invest and part of this risk is also the potential failure of a
start-up, which will result in the investor losing some or all of
his/her investment. In this entire scenario, guidance by investors plays
a significant role in the growth of start-ups.

Neeraj shares that being from the apparel sector, he surely adds extra
value to the start-ups especially related to the manufacturing and
sourcing front which saves their time and resources and increases the
opportunities for them. Overall it makes things easy for them.

Not just angel investors

Though there are mainly angel investors having background of apparel
industry, apparel giant company PDS Limited, having revenue of US $
1.185 billion, is actively making investments in early-stage start-ups
that offer a variety of solutions across the fashion supply chain. "Some
of the investments include a tech-driven approach to grow premium
sustainable cotton with 80 per cent less water and fertilisers; a brand
rating platform that makes it easier for consumers to shop ethical and
sustainable fashion and an intelligent business network that drives more
sustainable business practices," the company says in its annual report.

The early stage investments of PDS are to foster the development of
agile solutions for the future. Investing in opportunities that are in
sync with our focus areas helps future-proof enterprise and create value
for the long-term. Through PDS Venture Tech Investments, it has three
collaborations - True PDS Fund with a major focus on sustainable and
digital-first fashion and consumer brands. Apex Black VC Fund is for
AI/ML backed deep tech companies working on scientific breakthroughs and
business model disruptions.

Similarly, PDS Impact Fund in association with Yellow Octopus is a
Circular Fashion Impact Fund focused on investing in sustainability
across the fashion supply chain. The company is also partnering with
leading funds for co-investing in select opportunities.

It has invested in Filkor Limited, which developed a product destruction
process that allows for high-end fashion houses to transform their waste
and surplus stocks into a granulate that is then upcycled 100 per cent
into a variety of further uses like brick slips, shop fittings, and
other artistic and functional objects. Few of the digital-first consumer
brands have also got investment from the company like Bedfolk, Maude in
overseas. While in India, it has invested in Mumbai-based Verandah, a

Experts cite four major challenges to startups

The Citizen (Tanzania)

Length: 899 words

As speakers, advisers, and trainers in the entrepreneurial space, we've
been particularly excited by our December survey of the principles of 14
international accelerators. We wanted to know, from their point of view,
what were the key factors in startup success and failure.

This is the most recent study conducted on this subject. Although these
folks are from all over the world, it's amazing how much they agree when
it comes to why startups fail.

Inadequate testingInadequate Testing was by far the most mentioned
reason for startup failure. This factor is identified by several other
terms like not getting started, not understanding how to access the
market, and not understanding the barriers to entry.

But Greg Wright, founder of HATCH pitch put it quite succinctly,
"failure to test and validate hypotheses and assumptions," and its
corollary, "premature scaling (seeking/obtaining funding too early,
ramping production/teamadvertising before achieving
product-market-fit)."Keith Hopper, CEO of Danger Fort Labs adds, "Not
addressing an important enough need that customers are willing to pay
for.

"Ben Hsieh, program manager of Nest and Jason Cole, CEO, of Da Primus
Consulting both agree that "not finding product market fit" is a main
cause of failure.Eric Mathews, founder and CEO, of Start Co, says, a big
cause of failure is "building something nobody wants.

This accounts for about 50 per cent of failures. (This) is mitigated by
doing thorough market and customer discovery.

Before building anything, we tell our founders to go talk to 50 of their
real customers."Ashish Bhatia, founder/MD, of India Accelerator points
out, "Delaying the launch (is) one of the cardinal sins.

(Success is achieved) only by bouncing your idea off users. Excessive
perfectionism never works.

Go out and meet the customer. Get your hands dirty.

"Team incompatibilityTeam Incompatibility was the second most mentioned
cause of start-up failure. We were surprised at how often this roadblock
to success was mentioned.

It's about how the members of the founding team work together and
whether they have the proper skill sets to overcome the challenges
ahead.Elza Seregelyi, director of L-SPARK points out that a "fatal flaw
in (a) founding team (is when) founders who are self-aware may
successfully get help to overcome a gap or conflict in a certain area,
but those who are blindly one-sided (e.

., too technical or lacking domain expertise) or dysfunctional as a team
will be unable to execute.

"Joseph Bush, executive director, of Worcester CleanTech Incubator
thinks "inability to recruit, build and manage a team of people smarter
than oneself" is a big factor in start-up failure.Lauren Tiffan,
director of Ocean Accelerator adds simply, "Lack of business acumen.

" Or as Ben Hsieh, program manager of Nest, bottom lines, start-ups fail
when "(the) team lacked skills to execute."Eric Mathews, founder and
CEO, of Start Co expands on this common theme.

"It is important that the founding team have complimentary skills, not
be too large, be sacrificing equally to build the dream, be flexible and
coachable, and finally have bias towards action." But he warns,
"misalignment of stakeholders accounts for 20 per cent of failures and
occurs after product launch.

When the investors, founders, employees, board members, and other
stakeholders are not rowing in the same direction the company gets
ripped apart as various parties try to pull the business in different
directions."Lack of PersistenceLack of Persistence was the third most
commonly mentioned reason for startup failure.

As Jason Cole, CEO, of Da Primus Consulting puts it, "The leadership is
unable to set a clear strategy for the company and stick with it long
enough to succeed, resulting in a lot of wasted money and energy from
constant changes in direction."Or as Keith Hopper, CEO of Danger Fort
Labs puts it, "A lack of creativity and persistence in working through
the inevitable challenges of launching a new venture.

"Alyse Daunis, Program Manager, of Launch Alaska, adds "Lack of grit. We
all know startups are hard.

They take a tremendous amount of time and often require sacrifice.
Founders need to have grit to overcome obstacles and burnout.

"But as Elza Seregelyi, director of L-SPARK warns, "Inability or
unwillingness to adapt or pivot quickly when there is lack of
product-market fit. There is a fine line between persistence and
stubbornness and sticking with a product or business model that is not
gaining traction is just wasting resources.

"Everything elseOther reasons for startup failure are included in
thoughtful comments from:Nobu Kumagai, founder and managing partner of
Wildcard Incubator who points out that greed can be a cause of failure.
"This is the opposite of compassion (which is) the key element for
success.

Internal greed will end up with a breakup of talented co-founders.
External greed will force you to lose customers and community (pricing,
extra services, economic impact, etc.

). It used to be a Wall Street norm, nowadays it seems to become the
norm for Silicon Valley techies.

"Thanks to all the international accelerators for participating in this
timely survey. Be sure to check out their answers to why startups
succeed, published last month in entrepreneur.

com. And stay tuned for more insights from these folks whose business it
is to know about why startups succeed and fail.

Start-Ups: Apparel Industry Experts Investing Within The Industry

Apparel Online

September 1, 2022

Copyright 2022 Apparel Online, distributed by Contify.com All Rights

Length: 1155 words

Body

In India's apparel and textile industry, start-ups are strongly present
across many segments and dominate in B2B, B2C marketplaces and D2C
brands. These small to giant start-ups get funding of millions of
dollars from global venture capital firms as well as Indian investors.
Interestingly, there are a few angel investors who have deep
understanding and involvement in apparel manufacturing and retail.
Vineet Gautam, CEO, Bestseller India; Ananth Narayanan, Founder, Mensa
Brands; Anand S Ahuja, MD, Shahi Exports; Pallak Seth, Founder and Vice
Chairman, PDS Limited and Neeraj Goenka, Director, Texport Industries
are a few of them. Apart from funding, the guidance of investors is also
highly important for the start-ups and it is here that these
sector-specific experts add extra value to the start-ups with their
know-how, experience, network and overall understanding of the apparel
trade.

Funding to variety of start-ups

As far as funding by the apparel industry stalwarts is concerned,
several start-ups have been benefited by them. Vineet Gautam, a retail
virtuoso, has invested in B2B marketplace Groyyo and luxury fashion
omnichannel e-commerce platform Purple Style Labs. Anand S Ahuja and his
wife Sonam Kapoor Ahuja (having own fashion brand Rheson) supports the
leading marketplace Fashinza. Pallak, an angel investor since 2010,
loves supporting ambitious founders in solving market frictions and
leveraging technology as an angel investor alongside trusted partners.
He has co-invested alongside Sequoia Capital, Sierra Ventures, Social
Capital, Storm Ventures, Sherpa Ventures, etc., and helped entrepreneurs
through customer, co-investor and partner introductions.

Push to invest in start-ups

Investment in start-ups is naturally the preferred choice by the apparel
industrybased stalwarts as platforms like Fashinza and Groyyo have
gained momentum due to Covid disruptions, and with strong tech-base, the
future is definitely of B2B marketplaces. People's thrust on
sustainability increases the scope of renting platforms for designerwear
Stage 3 while luxury business and that through omnichannel is normally
growth-oriented. Rapid growth of start-ups like Purple Style Labs
achieving 50X growth in the last 4 years is further motivating the
industry stalwarts to invest in them. Overall from bootstrap to various
rounds of funding, the performance of startups and their execution of an
idea is a significant aspect for investors.

Anand's prominent investment areas are internet marketplace and
e-commerce but at the same time he is a vocal supporter of sustainable
fashion. His funding to Fashinza exemplifies his support to marketplace
and sustainability as Fashinza claims to take every step to diminish its
impact on the society and environment. Its partners are encouraged to
use sustainable fabrics produced without the use of harmful chemicals.

Another leading person of the industry who is also an investor is Neeraj
Goenka, Director, Texport Industries and Cofounder of The Robert Graham
brand. Having good exposure to apparel export as well as international
retail, Neeraj has invested in five start-ups of the apparel domain. D2C
brand aggregator GOAT Brand Labs, Threadsole (acquired by Coats)
software solutions are a few of them.

"All five start-ups related to apparel industry to whom I have funded
are doing well. I am very bullish about start-ups in the apparel sector
and especially the B2C segment as I believe that B2B is comparatively a
difficult category and B2C has more scope. For me to invest in any
start-up, the most important thing is a product. It has to be appealing
as well as should be for masses and scalable," says Neeraj who also
remained in the board of Venture Nursery (VN), India's first
angel-backed start-up accelerator. He is also a member of Indian Angel
Network since 2013.

Value added by apparel industry experts

Funding to early-stage start-ups allows an investor to reap maximum
benefits from a start-up's ideas. Unique ideas with innovative answers
to real-world issues, product uniqueness, market opportunities and
scalability are some of the core areas for an investor. Along with all
these aspects, team and overall management of start-up is also highly
important.

And against the investment in start-up, on an average, investors hope to
get at least five times (normally in 3-5 years) of what they have
invested. Investors take a higher risk when making the decision to
invest and part of this risk is also the potential failure of a
start-up, which will result in the investor losing some or all of
his/her investment. In this entire scenario, guidance by investors plays
a significant role in the growth of start-ups.

Neeraj shared that being from the apparel sector, he surely adds extra
value to the start-ups especially related to the manufacturing and
sourcing front which saves their time and resources and increases the
opportunities for them. Overall it makes things easy for them.

Not just angel investors

Though there are mainly angel investors having background of apparel
industry, apparel giant company PDS Limited, having revenue of US $
1.185 billion, is actively making investments in early-stage start-ups
that offer a variety of solutions across the fashion supply chain. "Some
of the investments include a tech-driven approach to grow premium
sustainable cotton with 80 per cent less water and fertilisers; a brand
rating platform that makes it easier for consumers to shop ethical and
sustainable fashion and an intelligent business network that drives more
sustainable business practices," the company says in its annual report.

The early stage investments of PDS are to foster the development of
agile solutions for the future. Investing in opportunities that are in
sync with our focus areas helps future-proof enterprise and create value
for the long-term. Through PDS Venture Tech Investments, it has three
collaborations - True PDS Fund with a major focus on sustainable and
digitalfirst fashion and consumer brands. Apex Black VC Fund is for
AI/ML backed deep tech companies working on scientific breakthroughs and
business model disruptions.

Similarly, PDS Impact Fund in association with Yellow Octopus is a
Circular Fashion Impact Fund focused on investing in sustainability
across the fashion supply chain. The company is also partnering with
leading funds for investing in select opportunities.

It has invested in Filkor Limited, which developed a product destruction
process that allows for high-end fashion houses to transform their waste
and surplus stocks into a granulate that is then upcycled 100 per cent
into a variety of further uses like brick slips, shop fittings, and
other artistic and functional objects. Few of the digital-first consumer
brands have also got investment from the company like Bedfolk, Maude in
overseas. While in India, it has invested in Mumbai-based Verandah, a
line of conscious luxury resort and swimwear.

Technology start-ups that fail fast succeed faster

IT Next

May 25 -- Failure rates of new technology-based companies are shockingly
high. It is estimated that 75% of technology start-ups do not generate
profits. Other data suggest upwards of 90% of new technology enterprises
completely fail.

However, some failures of products or technologies have been positive
and lead to success. It took Thomas Edison thousands of attempts before
he succeeded with his lightbulb design. Although learning from failure
has been described as critical to the success of technology-based
start-ups, there is little existing research that supports this claim.

Strategic management scholars have described and found support for a
number of organizational philosophies, behaviors, and strategies that
promote business success.

Read: [5 'product market fit' tips to make your startup successful]

However, little attention has been paid to empirically validate the
strategies that pertain to learning from failure in technology-intensive
industries.

My interest in this topic came from working as a manager for a global
biotechnology company. When creating novel innovations, their
organizational mantra was simple: fail fast to succeed faster. After
joining the faculty of Edwards School of Business at the University of
Saskatchewan, I wanted to explore if other technology-based start-ups
employed this failure learning strategy and how it influenced their
performance. This topic is an ongoing area of my research and relates to
the technology commercialization and venture development courses I
teach.

Failure can produce successIn my article published in the Journal of
High Technology Management Research, I explored commonalities of 120
leading Canadian technology start-ups. I found that those with
organizational commitments to learning from failure realized greater
scientific output, raised more capital, filed more new patents,
developed novel innovations, and achieved greater scientific milestones
as compared to other start-ups.

Specifically, firms with what I called a "failure learning orientation"
encouraged employees to openly discuss failures, sought to understand
why the failure occurred as opposed to who was responsible, prioritized
learning from the failure over any other activity, and strategized how
to move forward after failure. The relationship between failure learning
orientation and how well a company performed suggested that this
strategy could be viable for technology-based start-ups.

 

Building strategic alliances and seeking to understand how and why
failures occur are indicators of how well a technology start-up company
will perform. Credits: Shutterstock

 

Discovering desires, creating collaborationsAnother commonality of
leading firms pertained to their capacity to understand the desires of
customers in their respective markets. Not surprisingly, how they
understood customers and competitors was found to be an important
determinant of success.

However, it was not as critical to the early stages of technology
development as failure learning orientation or the ability to secure
partnerships with other firms. These partnerships were described as
non-competitive strategic alliances aimed at achieving mutually
beneficial goals. For example, performance was positively impacted if a
firm that had a great product but lacked marketing expertise was
successful in finding a partner that could assist with product
promotion.

The combination that yielded the greatest performance effect was
employing a learning from failure strategy and effectively searching,
managing, and coordinating complementary strategic alliances.

Positive strategiesThese findings have significant implications for
executives and managers of technology-based start-ups as they offer
strategies to improve performance in highly competitive industries. The
study confirms the importance of previously established strategies such
as market knowledge management.

More importantly, the study showed that strategic alliance management
and learning from failure may be viable strategies for technology
ventures. Most notably, the study offers a new perspective that
celebrates failures.

Businesses may wish to emphasize the positive outcomes from failures
such as learning rather than blame, as it pays to do so. It is this
supportive culture that fosters innovation driven by learning from past
steps that are common to the leading Canadian technology-based new
ventures.

The myth and magic of unicorns

Business Standard

April 13, 2021 Tuesday 6:26 PM GMT

Copyright 2021 Business Standard Private Limited All Rights Reserved

Length: 828 words

Body

Each day of the past week was seen as a red-letter day for the start-up
world as six internet-led firms turned unicorn in quick succession.
Celebrations were thick and fast, acknowledging the value of
entrepreneurship. The message was that India's finally arrived on the
scene where a $1-billion valuation for a privately-held start-up was not
a once in a blue moon phenomenon any longer.

According to US-based analytics platform CB Insights' database, out of a
total of 642 unicorns around the world, India has 29 as of April 2021.
Another data set from Venture Intelligence shows the India unicorn club
has 47 members and growing. The variation in number may be due to how a
start-up is counted as a unicorn (valuation of $1 bilion), decacorn ($10
billion) or hectocorn ($100 billion) and at what point it is phased out
of the list.

As in the case of any global ranking, becoming a unicorn is surely a
marker for a company in its growth story, but it's not a major
achievement nor is it a turning point of any significant worth. The
reason is there's nothing real about a start-up valuation. It's a
notional value of a start-up, depending on the cash flow availability,
ambition and assessment of the key investors funding and backing that
company. Since this valuation has nothing to do with revenues, profits
or any other benchmarks used in any traditional business, it's something
of a sentiment-driven play by investors. In this fickle start-up space,
investors may sometimes task companies with stiff performance targets,
and at other times, all they want is customer stickiness and footfall
irrespective of the real numbers.

Readers may remember the rollercoaster ride in multiple cases where high
valuation (unicorn or decacorn) does not ring-fence even star founders
of celebrated start-ups from failure. Think Flipkart, think Housing.com,
think Snapdeal, and so many others. Marquee investors, which help
start-ups enter the hall of fame, are in full control of the strings
throughout the journey; whether the outside world perceives the start-up
to be at dizzying heights is of little consequence.

Typically, a founder-investor showdown comes in public glare at the time
of a sale or an attempted sale of a start-up. In the case of Flipkart,
for instance, the company co-founder and poster boy of Indian e-commerce
Sachin Bansal, an IIT graduate, had to step down in 2018 when a clutch
of investors on the board led by Tiger Global Management's Lee Fixel
struck a deal to sell a majority stake in the Bengaluru-based firm to
Walmart in a $16-billion deal.

Sachin Bansal had little say during the boardroom negotiations about a
company he had founded along with Binny Bansal (not related) more than
10 years ago. Sachin, who had wanted to increase his single-digit stake
but could not, was absent in the post-deal photograph. He instead posted
a tweet to say he was out of Flipkart.

Another starry battle that made headlines was about real estate search
portal Housing.com.

Co-founder and then CEO Rahul Yadav had sent an email to Shailendra
Singh of Sequoia Capital, which was a key investor, in 2015. In the
email, which went public, 25-year-old Mr Yadav, an IIT dropout, said he
would vacate the firm if they (investors) didn't stop messing around
with him. The line in Mr Yadav's email which ensured his own exit
was-this marks the beginning of the end of Sequoia Cap in India. A
series of events followed-he resigned from the board after calling the
investors and board members incapable of a discussion, then he withdrew
his resignation, and finally Mr Yadav was ousted.

Two quotes were noteworthy after India made news with the rush of
unicorns. One was by Sachin Bansal, who founded fintech firm Navi
Technologies after his Flipkart stint, and another by Kunal Shah,
founder of credit card bill payment platform Cred, which just turned a
unicorn. Sachin said most entrepreneurs work for the love of the game
and wealth is a means to keep score. Mr Shah said the unicorn tag and
high valuations are all vanity metrics till the company delivers profit.
Unicorns are hope and belief of its stakeholders, he said. Sachin may
have been speaking from experience of founding one of the early and
super-hit unicorns in India. Mr Shah has been around in the entrepreneur
space for some time now and therefore he would know the real value
attached to a unicorn.

Incidentally, announcements on unicorns were slow-paced and discreet
earlier. For instance, the world got to know about Flipkart hitting the
magic figure of $1 billion valuation only in 2013, a year after it had
entered the unicorn club. A disclosure by one of its new investors then,
South Africa's Naspers, put the value of Flipkart at $1.04 billion based
on its last round of funding around a year ago. This was part of the
annual report to shareholders, stating that it had invested around $100
million in August 2012 to pick up a 10 per cent stake in Flipkart Pvt
Ltd.

The rest, as they say, is history.

Should taxpayers fund credit guarantee for start-ups?

MINT

October 11, 2022 Tuesday

New Delhi, Oct. 11 -- At first glance, the government's move to extend
collateral-free debt funding of up to Rs.10 crore to start-ups under the
Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade's (DPIIT) Credit
Guarantee Scheme for Start-ups appears to be a masterstroke, addressing
the biggest challenge faced by start-ups, particularly in the growth and
mid-stages of their development, while at the same time ensuring that
India continues to retain its leadership position as one of the most
vibrant markets for start-ups in the world, with more than 80,000
registered start-ups putting it in the third place in global rankings.

The scheme, notified last week, is pretty straightforward. The scheme
would underwrite - guarantee, in other words - up to 80 per cent of the
credit facility up to Rs.3 crore, 75 per cent of the credit facility
between Rs.3 and 5 crore, and 65 per cent of the credit facility between
Rs.5 and 10 crore extended to start-ups by banks and NBFCs.

In addition to transaction-based cover for single borrowers, there is
also an umbrella cover for a group of eligible borrowers, which will
provide a guarantee to venture debt funds registered under AIF
regulations of Sebi. "The extent of umbrella-based cover will be the
actual losses or up to a maximum of 5 per cent of pooled investment on
which cover is being taken from the fund in eligible start-ups,
whichever is lower. It is subject to a maximum of Rs.10 crore per
borrower," DPIIT said in a statement.

There is no mention of the corpus which will be used to underwrite these
guarantees, although an earlier plan proposed by the DPIIT proposed a
corpus of Rs.500 crore per year for four years as budgetary support to
the National Credit Guarantee Trust Company, which will operate the
guarantee scheme.

Credit guarantee schemes are of course a well-used tool by governments
around the world, particularly to help micro, small and medium
enterprises (MSMEs), which usually face the greatest difficulty in
finding funding support, particularly for working capital. Practically
every major economy launched such a scheme in the wake of the Covid
pandemic - according to a World Bank Tracker, as many as 57 new credit
guarantee schemes were launched in 2020 alone around the world, while
many existing ones were tweaked to address the special circumstances of
the pandemic.

There is also a strong economic rationale for publicly funded credit
guarantee schemes for MSMEs (most start-ups fall under this bracket),
since they account for almost a third of the GDP and a bulk of
employment (estimated at around 100 million) in India. Typically, such
businesses have high growth potential, contribute disproportionately to
local economies where they are located and are high employment
generators. At the same time, they tend to be highly risky, and are
constrained by lack of a prior - or adequate - financial track record
given their age and hence either miss out on traditional funding or have
to pay much higher interest rates. But, as an OECD study (Financing SMEs
and Entrepreneurs 2018) pointed out, the benefits have to be viewed
against the costs - not just of operating the scheme, but of the
opportunity cost of deploying public funds in this area vis-a-vis the
returns if they were deployed in other areas like physical and social
infrastructure creation, healthcare, education, etc.

This is where using taxpayer monies to fund risky start-ups becomes
problematic. For start-ups are not traditional MSMEs as we know them.
Take the eligibility criteria to be recognised as a start-up by the
DPIIT, the starting point for the scheme. They include an age criterion
(less than 10 years in existence after incorporation), a turnover limit
(an annual turnover not exceeding Rs. 100 crore for any of the financial
years since incorporation), should be an 'original entity' and not have
been formed by splitting up or reconstructing an already existing
business and most importantly, "Should work towards development or
improvement of a product, process or service and/or have scalable
business model with high potential for creation of wealth & employment."

The trouble is that there are no milestones/measures suggested to
measure the actual creation of "wealth and employment" as far as
start-ups are concerned. It therefore becomes practically impossible to
evaluate how well a start-up has performed in this context. Without
this, it is impossible to estimate the opportunity costs of using public
funds to back start-ups. So far, venture capitalists and funders have
taken on the downsides of backing start-ups - potential failures and
loss of value (Softbank's Vision Fund alone lost $21.68 billion in value
just in the first quarter of the current fiscal) and are therefore
justified in taking the upsides (venture funders made over $14.3 billion
in exits in 2021 according to Bain).

The government's guarantee scheme, though, leaves the upsides still in
private hand while passing on the downside risks to the taxpayers.

Banks need a tight framework, say experts

To cover all aspects of venture funding so as to safeguard bankers'
interests

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for banks to support start-ups by
investing in ideas needs to be backed by a comprehensive framework from
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), say banking and finance industry
experts.

In the absence of such a framework that would, among other things, cover
aspects such as NPA recognition and treatment of start-up failures,
public sector banks - which are into mostly asset-based lending - would
not venture into supporting start-ups, experts feel.

The framework should be tight and well-thought-out to encompass all
aspects of venture funding so as not compromise and expose the bankers
if such investee ventures were to fail due to market forces. No banker
would want to risk depositors' money in new start-ups without
safeguards. PM Modi had, earlier this week, told bankers to invest in
ideas thrown up by the start-ups and support their growth.

Funding start-ups "Start-up finance is nothing but venture capital
finance. Venture capital has never been part of banking. In VC, the
person who takes the risk profits if the venture succeeds and suffers
losses if it does not. The present regulatory framework does not allow
banks the same privilege. They do not profit if the investee venture
profits but if it makes losses, the bank loses money. There is a big
difference and PSBs definitely are not looking at funding start-ups", a
former chief executive of a PSB told BusinessLine. In PSBs, the monies
are that of the depositors and not that of the banker, this expert
pointed out.

Venture funding There has to be a mechanism where the PSBs' commercial
banking activities are ring-fenced from their venture funding efforts,
say experts. One way is to encourage banks to float their venture
funding entities.

PSBs are presently not allowed to do direct equity investments in
start-ups. At the most, they can set up vehicles that will do debt
funding. Even here, except for large banks like State Bank of India,
there has been very little activity by other PSBs. However, private
banks have in the recent years been taking equity exposure in fintechs
and other start-ups that they would like to partner with.

"Typically, a venture capital fund spreads its bet among a portfolio of
start-ups and if one or two among, say ten, becomes a successful
enterprise, it is able to recoup the losses made in other investee
companies in the portfolio. That is how the world of venture capital
works and it will not be easy for banks to replicate this given their
less-than-optimal skillsets in evaluating enterprises even if
regulations permit them to take equity bets in start-ups," said a
banking industry observer.

Srinath Sridharan, Corporate Advisor and independent markets
commentator, said "This would need the banking sector under RBI's
leadership to come up with requisite framework which encourages
entrepreneurship, ideas and reaps benefit for all the stakeholders and
also offers solutions to any hesitancy factors", he said.

Investing in Startups: Here's all you need to know; Investing in
start-ups can be tricky and complicated. It is important for investors
to understand the value they can bring to the table as well as their
risk appetite.

Being an entrepreneur is a mindset. You have to see things as
opportunities all the time. I like to do interviews. I like to push
people on certain topics. I like to dig into the stories where there's
not necessarily a right or wrong answer. - Soledad O'Brien

In her book 'Mindset', world-renowned Stanford University psychologist
Carol S. Dweck observes that people with a fixed mindset-those who
believe that abilities are fixed-are less likely to flourish than those
with a growth mindset-those who believe that abilities can be developed.
This Growth Mindset is the single biggest reason why entrepreneurs have
built the world's third biggest ecosystem for start-ups in India. The
start-up ecosystem which started with a few entrepreneurs, grew to a
handful, to many clusters across the world today supported by an
ecosystem that challenges the status quo for a better tomorrow, no
matter which field they straddle.

Let me explain this with a cricket analogy. In the cricket World Cup
played in 1996, Sri Lanka turned a motley bunch of bits and pieces
cricketers into the most invincible team in the history of the game.
What they lacked in skill, they more than made up with belief and
gumption. They cultivated match-winners and world-beaters within the
space of two years ago by charting a course, sticking to the strategy
which entailed everyone played well defined roles, complementing, and
backing each other. The same thing happened with Australian cricket team
under Alan Border in 1987 and the Indian cricket team under Sourav
Ganguly in 2003. They all had one thing in common - a bunch of young,
enthusiastic players thrust on to the world stage with confidence, never
say die attitude and a growth mindset. It helped that they were all
start-ups.

"Change is hard at first, messy in the middle, and gorgeous at the
end" - Robin Sharma

The same attitude is enabling entrepreneurs script an equally
spectacular success story among start-ups. Investing in start-ups can be
tricky and complicated. It is important for investors to understand the
value they can bring to the table as well as their risk appetite and
accordingly choose at which stage they would like to partner with the
entrepreneur and size the investments in the portfolio accordingly. E.g.
Earlier the stage, smaller the relative per company investment and more
the number of companies in the portfolio. In a way that brings down
risk, but also lowers the success ratio. According to American investor
and start-up founder Romeen Sheth, investing in start-ups is a cheat
code to participating in the future with asymmetric upside. Worst case,
you lose 1x your money. Best case you 1000x it.

Investing in start-ups can be considered high risk from a purely
financial standpoint. >50% of your portfolio of companies (especially in
early stage) may lose you all your capital. But your top 5-10% may
deliver super normal returns that may lead to handsome portfolio IRRs.
But in both, there are seldom losers. In fact, the impact you would have
created by investing in and backing the right entrepreneur who may not
have delivered you returns in your portfolio now, is much bigger as
he/she will very likely be the one featuring in the top 5-10% of your
future portfolio.

There's a lot of noise about how there's too much capital sloshing
around. I think there isn't enough capital moving around. To believe the
ecosystem is overcapitalized is to believe that human creativity is
fully tapped - Romeen Sheth

Start-up investing is more than just investing your capital. It is about
reimagining the future. It is about building for a sustainable future.
It is also about the positive impact you can create to the eco-system
beyond your capital. Capital is just one piece of the puzzle.

"Silicon Valley is a mindset, not a location." - Reid Hoffman, Founder,
LinkedIn

It is important to remember that there are no set rules for start-up
investing. You must pick up the skills while being on the job. You must
be a lifelong learner. Either you have to build something or fix
something and no amount of Ivy League education will teach you that.
According to Naval Ravikant, the most valuable start-up of the last
decade didn't raise money, didn't have employees, gave away the cap
table, and let anyone invest.

Unless you are into paediatrics or developmental medicine, aging should
not be seen using the distance from birth, rather through the estimated
distance from death - Nassim Nicholas Taleb

Investing in Start-ups: Winning Success; Losing Failure

Here are a few handy pointers to pick the right partner:

Does he/she have a growth mindset? Is he/she a dreamer and a good and
inspiring storyteller?

Does the problem statement have potential to create a tangible impact to
a large user group?

Does he/she have a single-minded focus in execution to achieve the
vision of the company come what may?

Many times, especially in later stages, investors may not be able to
access the founder as he/she is busy building a business. Hence it is
not a bad idea to work with institutions and seek access through funds
that aggregate likeminded capital and funnel it to the businesses. In
either case, an investor will always be successful whether winning or
losing in individual portfolio investments.

This is hard. This is fun. - Carol Dweck

Functioning In A Financially Intelligent Way: Anil Lamba, Director,
Lamcon

Business World

In terms of the ideal profile for an individual, Lamba explained that
one's portfolio should be well-balanced, with some investments in
stocks, some in real estate, a little bit in gold, and the rest divided
among various other things such as tax-saving investments and so on

"When a company fails due to financial mismanagement, it's not because
the finance department is ineffective; rather, financial mismanagement
occurs every single day in everyone's actions. "As a result, every act
must be carried out in a financially prudent manner," said Dr Anil
Lamba, Director at Lamcon Finance & Management Services.

While speaking at the Pune Chapter of the Indian Business Literature
Festival, Lamba discussed why intelligent people struggle to understand
finance. He said, "Firstly, the finance people are terrible at marketing
it. Additionally, the way the finance curriculum is set up, it gives the
impression that finance is a challenging, dull subject. As a result,
most people hold the same opinion. On the contrary, I think it's one of
the most intriguing topics. To create this awareness for a wider
audience, I wrote this book called Romancing The Balance Sheet."

Lamba provided crucial business advice by stating that people believe
business is about generating top lines, but it is actually about the
bottom line. Secondly, he added that just because you have made profit,
it doesn't mean you have arrived, as profit and money have no connection
with each other. So, cash flow matters. The third thing is regarding the
cost of capital. People think that the owner's money is free, whereas,
in reality, it is probably the most important source of money available.

When asked about the things he wished young people knew, he added, "I
wish people understood that it is very important to start investing
early. I wish everybody knew that a significant portion of your
investment should be in stocks, and it should only be after learning the
know-how of the stock market. I wish the power of compounding and the
kind of toll inflation can take on your investments were known to them."

Speaking about the ideal profile for an individual, Lamba said that
one's portfolio should be a balanced one with certain investments in
stocks, certain in real estate, and a small amount in gold, and the
remainder can be divided into a number of other things like tax-saving
investments and so on.

"I don't think anyone can guarantee that this startup will succeed in
this manner." Many people have greatly benefited from it, but I believe
that currently there are too many people engaging in it. However, the
ability to see into the future remains crucial to making the right
decision. Having said so, financial mismanagement will be the cause of
many start-up failures in India," he added while talking about
investments in start-ups.

Success rate of startups in India higher than rest of world: Goyal

New Delhi: The success rate of startups in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world and there were 84,012 recognised startups in
the country at the end of November, Union minister Piyush Goyal told Lok
Sabha on Wednesday. “Startups are prone to failures is a very high
probability.

Though I must say, the success rate of startups in India is relatively
higher than the rest ofthe world...,” the minister said, adding that the
number of recognised startups has increased from 452 in 2016 to 84,012
as on November 30, 2022. Goyal's detailed response to queries on India's
start-up ecosystem, however, led to some sharp exchanges between the
opposition and treasury benches, especially after Adhir Ranjan
Chowdhury's objected to Goyal's “political statement” instead of pithy
responses to members' questions. Chowdhury al-so objected to Goyal
refusing to acknowledge the Congress government's role in setting up the
premier IITs, which he said hosts one of the country's most successful
start-up incubators. “The Incubation Centre in IIT Madras is doing such
a phenomenal work that in a short span of time the start-ups that have
been created at that centre have a combined valuation of over Rs 30,000
crore. Today, they have built 12 lakh square feet of area in which they
have provided some of the most modern equipment,” Goyal had said.

It's time to change the way India does business; Regulatory cholesterol
is one of the reasons for start-ups to lose heart-the failure rate of
start-ups is quite high, but closure can take more than two years

Regulatory cholesterol is one of the reasons for start-ups to lose
heart-the failure rate of start-ups is quite high, but closure can take
more than two years

In her Budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman put a greater spotlight on Ease
of Doing Business through many measures-simplifying GST process,
e-assessments for tax, interchangeable Aadhaar and PAN, etc. The
government's intent to further simplify procedures, reduce red-tape and
make the best use of technology was clearly set out. However, there was
no reference of a refreshing, revolutionary move that is already on the
cards. A draft Cabinet note has reportedly been circulated last month on
the National Ease of Doing Business Policy, where, for the first time,
we see the government holding the bureaucrats accountable for the
compliance requirements they place on businesses.

The details are not out yet in the public. According to media reports,
ministries and departments must measure the time and cost of compliance
requirements. The rationale behind licensing to be explained, as
departments are being asked to replace licences where possible with
simple registration processes or simplify process where the removal of
licences is not possible. Departments also have to justify the frequency
of renewals they demand.

Holding bureaucrats accountable for the pain they inflict through
compliance marks a structural break in the way India regulates and
controls businesses. There is a three-vector framework that is key to
Ease of Doing Business-rationalisation (rationalising the 1,100+ Acts
and 58,000+ compliances that govern businesses), simplification
(reducing the 3,100+ filings and 2,500+changes every year), and
digitisation (using the GST template of an API architecture that allows
straight-through-processing of filings from external systems, instead of
uploading documents to a government website with passwords). Viewing
compliance within this framework will facilitate the re-engineering that
the government is targeting.

Once you set in force a mindset change, and control the controllers,
there will be significant productivity gains for firms. One of the
biggest constraints to scale currently is the exponential increase in
compliance as a firm grows. Actual client data from Avantis Regtech
shows that a mid-sized manufacturing company spread across six different
states is regulated by over 5,000 compliances, approximately 100
licences and registrations-making for an average of two filings a day. A
small firm is faced by around 10 filings a month-not an easy task. The
proposed policy has suggested that the compliance burden should be
capped at an hour per month for start-ups. Our submission is that a
similar benchmark should be placed for micro and small firms.

The government has recognised the vision and passion of start-ups to
scale up, yet treats them on par with larger businesses when it comes to
compliance. Typically, start-ups are run by young, first-time
entrepreneurs, who have no idea what hits them when they are faced with
the heavy compliance requirements-a start-up working from a home
office/shared space, in its first year, needs to obtain registrations
under at least seven regulators and file a minimum of 18 returns to a
maximum of 69 returns. Not surprisingly, regulatory cholesterol is one
of the reasons for start-ups to lose heart-the failure rate of start-ups
is quite high, but closure can take more than two years!

The proposals regarding the vexatious angel tax issue are steps in the
right direction. Yet, so much more can be done to make it easy for a
start-up to begin operations, grow or exit if needed. Some compliance
requirements can be removed, for example, mandate only one board meeting
a year, instead of two, implement single window NOC clearances for
closure, have a single annual return for MCA instead of 4-5 now and an
annual TDS return instead of quarterly, etc. These are simple steps that
will make a world of difference to the life of a young entrepreneur, who
is out to take on the world.

Over the past five years, India's ranking has risen dramatically in the
World Bank Ease of Doing Business index from 130 to 77. But this
achievement has not really meant much for businesses in India struggling
under the weight of 58,000+ possible compliances and 3,100+ possible
filings annually. The government has now finally come through, and taken
on board the pain and stress of the compliance burden. The proposed
National Ease of Doing Business Policy can be a game-changer, making a
greater impact on growth and formal employment, than government
programmes and subsidies. It is time to remember the spirit and intent
of a regulatory framework-effective regulation need not be complicated,
control need not be cumbersome. It is time to bury the license raj and
inspector raj forever.

Indore: Yaas adding to Covid woes of start-ups, WiFi crash for prolonged
periods affecting delivery schedules

Indore: With effects of cyclone Yaas reaching Indore, stormy rains have
become a part of evenings for the last two days. While the cool rains
are great for Indoris to relax with tea and pakoda, these winds have
jammed up several wires and connections resulting in not just blackouts,
but also internet connectivity issues.

Since the lockdown, most start-ups switched to working from home, as it
was not feasible for many to even maintain their offices. With various
teams working in different parts of the city, the only way to coordinate
was via virtual meetings and connectivity rooms.

Now, with frequent internet failures and blackouts, many young
entrepreneurs are finding it hard to deliver their work in time. With
the delay in project delivery, start-ups are now facing a major problem
of convincing their clients.

"Our clients are mostly international, so explaining them how and why
such frequent internet failures are hampering our work, is kind of
tough," said Dikshant Mahant, co-founder of an IT start-up.

He added that for power backups, most of them use back-up devices and
inverters, but sudden WiFi crash for long periods is now becoming a
major issue. "I lost a client in the two days, because of
misunderstandings rising due to network failure," Mahant said.

Another start-up founder Naval Jain said, "Start-ups have faced a
challenging time since Covid-19 outbreak, and now, just when we learned
to survive by adapting to the new world post the virus, it seems that
this world is also crumbling down." He added that internet challenges,
power outages and falling economy is taking over and many start-ups are
forced to shut down their operations.

Start-Ups Get to Right Unit Economics Within 3-4 Years Incorporation,
Says Vidur Vyas of NorthSide

September 07 -- For start-ups, expanding early, without establishing the
core proposition, results in dilution while expanding late can leave
revenue opportunities on the table.

Last three years have changed a lot of things for start-ups. These three
years turned many of the start-ups into unicorn while many more were
forced to shut. Some people say money is the issue, behind failure of
start-ups, lack of planning say others. Apart from these, a number of
things like proper guidance, credibility of ideas and proper marketing
are some largely accepted things responsible for making or breaking any
business.

As the number start-ups have been seen rising, government has started a
number of incubator programmes to help them. Various business have also
came in this sector while help another businesses to grow. To understand
how this realme has been transforming, we talked Vidur Vyas, Founder and
Chief Executive Officer of NorthSide.

-   How can NorthSide help in taking an idea to execution? 

NorthSide has a venture incubator where ideas are taken to the launch
stage by providing insights, market mapping, positioning development,
creative asset development, D2C and e-commerce scale-up, all under one
roof.

The NorthSide venture incubator is run by an expert team with over 20+
years of experience in scaling brands and launching successful
innovations. The team is a mix of entrepreneurs and former CXOs of large
corporations, creative directors, and digital and e-commerce experts
that work with software-based solutions that help in taking the idea to
the launch stage, and if needed, scale it up further.

-   What are the Dos and Don'ts in a startup culture or MSMEs?

Startups and MSMEs need to be careful with their capital and put it to
good use.

One of the most important things is developing your customer value
proposition using experts. At a broad level, the product or service
offered by the startup can be better, cheaper or faster. Identifying the
winning value proposition is the most important investment a startup can
make.

At NorthSide, we believe in validating the proposition with a small
investment first, before making more investment. This prevents pivoting
later, which is more expensive and does not help the company in the long
run.

 

-   What are the must-haves to run a startup or MSMEs?

The startup must think in terms of building expertise & using a
validated viable product or service to raise capital.

While capital is easier to get, startups need to invest behind expertise
by hiring the right talent or using consultants in the initial stages to
set up the right processes and systems.

 

-   How to run a profitable startup or MSME?

Start-up companies need to think about their business model and
profitability from day zero. Many companies make the mistake of thinking
that the business model will improve with scale even when the unit
economics are not right. Good start-ups are usually able to get to the
right unit economics within 3-4 years of starting up. Another important
thing is to invest behind marketing- building and communicating your
value proposition to acquire and retain customers. For this companies
should think behind investing in technology and using it to scale up
their proposition.

NorthSide's Brand Builder program helps in finding the right customer
value proposition and positioning the brand in a competitive context. In
the last 4 years, two companies that have worked with NorthSide have won
the National Start-up award, some have got funded with investment rounds
and many have experienced revenue growth of up to 40X.

-   How to keep thriving in the competitive marketplace and what are the
      key learnings you should be mindful of?

At NorthSide, we encourage brands to do three things well to win in the
marketplace

-   Get the price benefit segment of your brand right and try and
      maximise customer acquisition within the segment.

Often brands try and play with discounts to get to a customer segment,
which is unsustainable in the long run. Instead of doing that, investing
behind various forms of advertising and developing is always a connected
strategy.

-   Build your brand image by responding to customer feedback

Responding to customer feedback is vital. It shows that a company cares
and is also an important tool to get insights. Often brands do not have
processes in place where they listen effectively as a result they miss
out on opportunities to earn consumer respect and opportunities to
innovate.

-   Winning in the marketplace model in the long run is difficult unless
      the MRP of the brand is above Rs. 300/-.

This is because of the margins and cost of delivery. Brands should
therefore build out their own D2C model alongside and think in terms of
a hybrid model to reach selected stores offline.

 

-   How and when to expand your start-up?

Start-up brands need to find the right time to expand. Expanding early,
without establishing the core proposition, results in dilution while
expanding late can leave revenue opportunities on the table.

At NorthSide, we believe that brands should expand once their repeat
customer rate crosses a quantified threshold and the unit economics from
their first geography is favourable. Expanding before achieving both is
dilutive.

 

-   How should a brand position itself in different channels?

Using consistent brand visuals across channels is important to get
consistent brand positioning. At NorthSide, we do this by developing one
key visual, which helps position the product in a competitive context
and then adapt that image for use across channels.

-   How far the startup culture has come and what does it need to
      succeed?

Any business is about the final consumer. A startup culture must capture
this fully and we therefore believe that a startup must have consumer
-centricity at the core of its culture. Another important thing is to
have a culture where investors' money is treated like your own money-
ethics and integrity are a must.

Pune: Experts at a webinar on specialised technology and startup
incubators said that proper mentoring, better access to resources, and
an active interface with universities and engineering colleges could
help more startups to succeed."The rate of failure among startups in
India is quite substantial, at about 90%. The startup ecosystem is not
able to work to its capacity. We have to find ways to reduce the failure
rate," said Vishwas Mahajan, chairman, incubation and startup committee,
Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA), which
organised the webinar on Friday.The attendees included functionaries of
startup mentorship and incubation wings of academic institutions,
industry collectives, among others.

Several of them pointed out that having an active interface with
educational institutions was necessary for hand-holding and mentoring
students from the ideas stage."Our institute is situated on the campus
of the College of Engineering Pune (COEP), and the students and startup
company owners have access to laboratories and faculty at COEP. We are
training not just students who have ideas regarding setting up of
startups, but also mid-career startups, especially in fields like
cyber-security and artificial intelligence, as they need some amount of
experience to back them up," said Vijay Talele, of BHAU Institute, an
academic incubator, which currently support around 75 startups."We find
that there are good ideas in students about e-vehicles, surveillance
technologies, waste-management, and others. We have recently signed an
MoU with Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), which will bring
students to our incubation centre," said Kiran Vaidya, managing
director, Auto Cluster Research and Development Institute. For Reprint

Soonicorns, Unicorns and Now Decacorns: The Golden Era of Startups Has
Arrived in India!

A wave of entrepreneurship has now consumed India with new startups
coming to the fore every single day. The Indian Government recently
revealed that from just 700 odd startups in the financial year 2016-17,
India is currently home to as many as a whopping 72,993 startups that
have been recognized by the Department for Promotion of Industry and
Internal Trade (DPIIT). According to the Startup India Government
portal, India is currently the third largest startup ecosystem in the
world, which is further expected to witness a year-on-year growth of
around 12-15 percent.

In addition to that, startups in the country have been able to create an
estimated 40,000 new jobs over the years, taking the total jobs in the
start-up ecosystem to 1.6-1.7 lakh. These exciting figures sure makes
one wonder as to what led to the tremendous upsurge of new age
businesses in India. Vikas Bhonsle, CEO, Crayon Software Experts, is of
the view that this advancement is the result of the Government of India
taking cognizance of the startup momentum worldwide at the right time.

"A lot is being done and extended by the Government of India to
accelerate the Start-up ecosystem and compete with the leading
economies. The Startup India initiative connects the Indian startup
ecosystem to global startup ecosystems through various engagement
models. Startup India has launched bridges with over 15 countries such
as Brazil, Sweden, Russia, Portugal, UK, Finland, Netherlands,
Singapore, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Croatia, Qatar and UAE
that provide a soft-landing platform for startups from the partner
nations and aid in promoting cross- collaboration," said Vikas.

Vikas also stated that easy availability of capital was extremely
essential for entrepreneurs at the early stages of the growth of an
enterprise, as the capital required at this stage often presents a
make-or-break situation for startups with good business ideas. "To
overcome the funding barriers, the Government of India, as part of the
Startup India initiative, is implementing the Fund of Funds for Startups
(FFS) Scheme and Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) to provide
financial assistance to startups through Alternative Investment Funds
(AIFs) and incubators, which is extremely beneficial for the startup
ecosystem," noted Vikas.

In the same vein, Sudha Rangarajan, SVP, Strategy and Capital Raise,
Yubi, said that along with the positive initiatives undertaken by the
Indian Government, the wave of entrepreneurship must also be attributed
to the transformative mindset of youth in the country. "India is now
home to a thriving startup ecosystem and is only behind the USA and
China when it comes to the number of startups. This is made possible by
a significant change in the mindsets of educated youngsters, who are
okay with the risks of starting up or working for a startup rather than
remain comfortable in the safety of an established organisation. Failure
of a startup is no longer looked down upon and has made people with
ideas take a real shot at them. While startups are being set up in
various segments and verticals, tech-led startups are the highest in
number owing to the advancements made in communications and related
technologies combined with affordable pricing. This is increasing the
total addressable market (TAM) of tech-led businesses, leading to more
of them getting set up and funded" said Rangarajan.

Disruptions and Digital Penetration Present a Significant Opportunity
for Startups

Vikram Labhe, Vice President and Managing Director, Fivetran India, is
of the view that India is one of the fastest growing economies globally
and technology is at the forefront of this. "Disruptions are not only
dramatically changing the way we do business, but how we live and manage
our lives in general. The current rate of our digital penetration
presents infinite opportunities for start-ups especially those in the
technology space. We have a very large pool of tech talent, and even a
small percentage of them moving into entrepreneurship leads to
potentially disruptive and innovative products coming out of India. Now
is the best time to take the plunge, with capital also available for the
right startups," he commented.

Labhe went on to add that much credit for this notable development goes
to the Government of India for initiating the "Startup India" programme
to provide increased focus, visibility and funding opportunities to help
start-ups realise their true potential. "According to data from Invest
India, we have become the third largest start-up ecosystem in the world
as of 27 June 2022. The success stories and role models of our start-ups
will help inspire aspiring entrepreneurs to take bold steps towards big
achievements and make our start-up ecosystem an extremely vibrant one,"
stated Labhe.

Entrepreneurship Has Now Become Socially Acceptable

Monish Darda, Chief Technology Officer and Co-founder, Icertis, quoting
the Economic Survey 2021-22, highlighted that 555 districts in India
have at least one new start-up and record investments worth up to $3.5
billion have been made in this ecosystem with three new digital start-
ups being founded every hour. "All of these data points are the proofs,
that the rise of Indian start- ups is real and it is here. And the
forces driving this rise are diverse and powerful," observed Monish.

He further observed: "Entrepreneurship is becoming socially acceptable,
even celebrated, and an innovative mindset is fuelled by a tech boom in
SaaS, AI, blockchain (crypto included!), gaming, and the metaverse.
These social and technological forces are complemented by geopolitical
forces that have ensured stability to the Indian economy that many other
regions in the world seem to have lost, making India as attractive as
ever before for angel investors, budding entrepreneurs and enterprises
alike. The celebrated silicon valley in the Bay Area of California gave
rise to an ecosystem that was unique because of the availability of
entrepreneurial talent, the size of the market, and the availability of
capital - in India, the whole country is turning into that ecosystem."

ceremony on the 11th of January, 2020.

The summit started with the lighting of the lamp by the eminent speakers
and the moderator. Mr Pritish Gupta, Founder of Reach Out Consulting set
the stage by pointing out the reality of Start-Ups where failures are a
must. The first speaker of the day, Mr Akash Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO of
Mobycy shed light on solving the problem of mobility keeping
sustainability in mind. He stressed on the fact that new innovation is
always a learning curve in which a start-up has the room to accommodate.
The next speaker was Ms. Madhusmita Panda, Head of Marketing, KredX
India. Having struggled immensely to keep her company alive, she gave a
few pointers on how to never assign one particular reason to the failure
of an enterprise. Mr Ravi Ranjan a Startup Expert talked about how
Indian culture is very entrepreneurial and this needs to be levered for
young entrepreneurs.

Mr Ravi Ranjan, continued his discussion elaborately in the second half
of the day on "Can startups support the government when corporates
can't?", giving interesting insights about the bigger picture and
encouraging young minds to not only think about themselves but also for
the society at large. He stressed that technology and innovation will be
of prime importance in solving these problems.

The final Speaker of the day was, Mr Samir Singh Sheikhawat, a thought
leader and startup advisor, Ex-United Breweries Limited. His vast
industry knowledge of 31 years helped him find the truth behind
strategies and marketing. In his professional life, he had found that
consumer today is not only looking for commodities but experience over
possession.

challenge in association with Pee Safe. Management students from all
over the country such as IIM Ranchi, SCMHRD to name a few participated
to provide an innovative solution to menstrual health and safety judged

The common narrative around the success or failure of startups is much
like what we have seen and heard in stock markets over the past many
decades. Successes get a loudspeaker, while failures fade into oblivion
with hardly anyone noticing. While the analogy sounds about right, there
is one big difference - we don't talk about failures enough. Every
failed startup costs hundreds of jobs, if not more, consumes valuable
resources and ends up in the shattered dreams of an aspiring
entrepreneur.

In a certain obvious way, understanding the reasons for failure can also
become a roadmap to success. What I am writing here comes from my
experience of trying to build a bunch of startups in 2014-15, followed
by the success we saw with InterviewBit and Scaler. Let's dig in. The
chances of success improve dramatically when we build a purpose-driven
organisation where financial outcomes are welcome and necessary to
sustain growth. Once the purpose is clear, converting it into a killer
product (or service) that is backed by a motivated team will be
relatively easy.

The global experiences of startups also teach us the value of raising
the right amount of funds at the right time to decide whether the
organisation can survive teething challenges. What is equally important,
if not more, is to be wise and thoughtful of how we spend those funds.
Too many good ideas have died because entrepreneurs splurged too much
money on things that don't matter, such as fancy offices, over-the-top
employee perks, etc. The pragmatist in me always seeks ways to conserve
cash while figuring out where we get the best bang for the buck.

Scaling up the business is only secondary to the soundness of the
business itself. It comes in two parts - identifying a challenge that is
big enough to warrant all the blood, toil and tears and creating a
business model that will provide a sustainable solution to a challenge
is far more important than rushing to acquire customers.

At the risk of sounding like a nave idealist, I will even say that
making big bucks is not as important as the passion for what we do. That
is the fuel that will keep us going even on bad days when one is tempted
to give up and accept failure. To give an example closest to my heart,
we saw the skill gaps in the Indian IT sector, particularly in emerging
areas like machine learning and data science, as a significant challenge
that can cripple India's $200 billion IT industry.

As for the business model, we created one "of, by and for" the tech
industry. The success we have tasted so far is because of this.
Addressing an industry challenge with the help of the people facing the
challenge makes all the difference. Sounds obvious? While that may be
true, nine out of ten startups fail to break these cardinal rules. The
regular CB Insights report on why startups fail affirms this. Running
out of cash, lack of market and flawed business model features are among
the top reasons for failures.

Interestingly, the passion or the lack of it (and running out of it) is
placed lowest among the 12 reasons the report has listed, something I
don't agree entirely. We will be underestimating the value of passion at
our own peril. Some of the most successful startups that are universally
admired came out of the serious passion of the founders to disrupt
status-quo in their respective fields. Think Apple, Google, and Amazon.

Finally, picking the right investors on the road to success is vital. As
I said earlier, cash is essential, but so is the source. In that sense,
investors are not bankers but partners in the business. Therefore it is
crucial to find those with whom we share values. The last thing an
entrepreneur needs is an investor who cannot wait to make a small
windfall at the expense of the business's long-term health. Founders and
investors falling out due to differences in how the business should be
run is much more common than most people would imagine.

Success as an outcome is not guaranteed. Businesses can fail for several
reasons, including external shocks that no one can predict, like the
Covid pandemic. But there is undoubtedly a lot we can do to improve the
chances of success.

Important points to keep in mind so that your startup doesn't fail

India Today Online

October 11, 2022 Tuesday 04:44 PM GMT

Copyright 2022 India Today All Rights Reserved

[]

Length: 627 words

Body

The startup world is extremely risky; as the saying goes, "nine out of
ten startups fail." That's a staggering failure-to-success ratio. So
much so that when we talk about startups, we almost always talk about
failure. Many aspiring entrepreneurs are discouraged by their fear of
failure. The game of startups is all about risk management. As you grow,
you might be excited to begin scaling up your startup. But there are
challenges in the road ahead that could lead to certain failures. Make
sure you avoid these mistakes most startups make when they grow rapidly.

ANALYSING THE MARKET FIT

Several entrepreneurs fail to recognise that when it comes to putting
their business idea into action, they should prioritise meeting market
needs. However, it is important to remember that the solution to those
problems does not always have to be conventional. What we need to
understand is that failure isn't necessarily due to the market's lack of
interest in our product or service, but rather to our inability to keep
up with current business trends and behaviour for a reasonable amount of
time. As a result, conducting a thorough market study, as well as
working collaboratively with potential customers for the test and trial,
interviewing and surveying the target market to understand market needs
and market fit, becomes necessary.

HAVING A DEFINED BUSINESS PLAN

All new businesses require a well-thought-out business plan with
realistic and educated projections for the future. The structure will be
critical in the early stages, but many start-up businesses fail because
they set their vision too high or diversify too soon. It is critical
that you stick to the business plan you created in order to establish
goals and objectives and to know where to direct your business. In other
words, this helps you and your team understand what you and your team
need to do to take the company to the next level.

HIRING A GOOD TEAM

A great team with diverse skill sets is essential for a startup's
success. Recruiting a quality team of people to work alongside you is
critical to the success of your new business, and it takes careful
consideration to ensure that each employee brings a new skill to the
table. The same is true for your business partner; they should be as
enthusiastic as you are and possess skills and knowledge that complement
yours.

PROMOTE YOUR BUSINESS

As a startup, you must use all marketing channels to propel your company
forward; using one channel in isolation is unlikely to yield the desired
results. Marketing, branding, raising awareness, and so on all take a
significant amount of time. If you want your venture to succeed, you
must understand how to attract the attention of your target market and
convert them into leads and customers.

MANAGING FINANCES

Financial management is critical for all types of start-up businesses.
This is one of the reasons why even large corporations fail. When your
cash reserves are depleted, you will be unable to sustain your business
without raising additional funds. Both long-term and short-term cash
requirements should be carefully planned. Businesses that do not seek
professional advice risk having their financial problems worsen.

IDENTIFY AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY

Identifying areas of opportunity is the only way for a business to
improve and increase its chances of continuing to operate and attract
customers. You must identify the aspects of the business that need to be
improved, such as manufacturing, administrative, or maintenance
processes, and consider how to improve them.

Success rate of startups in India higher than the rest of world: Goyal

New Delhi: The success rate of startups in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world and there were 84,012 recognised startups in
the country at the end of November, Union minister Piyush Goyal told Lok
Sabha on Wednesday. “Startups are prone to failures is a very high
probability. Though I must say, the success rate of startups in India is
relatively higher than the rest of the world...,” the minister said,
adding that the number of recognised startups has increased from 452 in
2016 to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022. Goyal's detailed response to
queries on India's start-up ecosys- tem, however, led to some sharp
exchanges between the opposition and treasury benches, especially after
Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's objected to Goyal's “political statement”
instead of pithy responses to mem- bers' questions. Chowdhury also
objected to Goyal refusing to acknowledge the Congress government's role
in setting up the premier IITs, which he said hosts one of the country's
most successful start-up incubators. “The Incubation Centre in IIT
Madras is doing such a phenomenal work that in a short span of time the
startups that have been created at that centre have a combined valuation
of over Rs 30,000 crore, ” Goyal had said.

Get set, go and never falter

The Pioneer (India)

May 3, 2019 Friday

Length: 843 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, May 3 -- One of the major factors responsible for the high
failure rate of start-ups in India is the lack of proportional growth of
incubators. Ironically, the concept of incubators or accelerators - an
organisation that shows the way for the start-up companies to speed up
their growth and success - is still in the nascent stage while the
start-up culture is flourishing with incessant growth. In a country
where more than 1,000 startups are born every year, there are hardly 150
incubators and they, too, are failing to support a majority of
endangered young businesses. Consequently, 90 per cent of the start-ups
succumb to weak immunity even before their fifth anniversary. Though
it's encouraging that India enjoys the status of being the world's
third-largest start-up ecosystem, high failure rate is one big concern
for all stakeholders, including foreign investors . To overcome barriers
on the path of toddler businesses, there is an urgent need for a robust
incubation system, one that runs parallel to the rising startup culture.
But before ensuring sustainability to this culture, incubators must deal
with the challenges they come across quite frequently.

Distance barriers : Ideas and entrepreneurs can be born anywhere and
anytime - not just in Delhi or Mumbai but also in other big and small
cities that have become a breeding ground for businesses. Despite the
fact that 70 per cent of India's population lives in rural areas, the
maximum incubators are located in metro cities and Tier-I cities.
Distance keeps many potential start-ups out of the reach of enabling
systems. Although India's communication infrastructure has improved
significantly, everything related to business cannot be shared and
understood over phone and emails. So, first of all, incubators must
increase their physical reach to tap the growing opportunities in
smaller cities and towns.

Lack of compatibility : Many a time, the aim of an entrepreneur does not
align well with the vision of the incubating team because of the
asymmetry between ambition and viability. It's really difficult to
convince a budding entrepreneur as to why an idea, as shared by him/her,
scores low on feasibility and viability. Often, the entrepreneur wants
to go with the original ideas without even considering the alternative
of an incubator. This opinion clash reduces the enthusiasm of the
mentors and the end result is that neither the client nor the incubators
is satisfied. The best way to prevent these kind of conflicts is by
conveying all probable challenges in the initial rounds instead of
throwing light on them in the middle of the journey. So, keeping clarity
during official as well as non-official communication is the best
antidote for communication barriers.

Funding vs revenue : Enabling a business to generate good revenue is
more profitable than improving its traction for more funding. Here, the
focus of an incubator should be to maintain a balance between fund
management and revenue growth. In the initial phases, most incubators
focus on luring the investors and care little about untapping the market
potential for business. Though this one-dimensional approach helps
secure required funds for the business, slow growth in revenue increases
the financial liability of the company even in the infancy stage. Hence,
the goal of funding should be smooth functioning, market penetration and
achieving revenue targets. If funding is merely increasing the liability
of a firm and revenue is not growing simultaneously, then it is an
alarming situation for the startup.

Ensuring scalability : High scalability means better sustainability -
this principle applies to almost every business but is more applicable
to startups, which should be more flexible to mould themselves as per
changes in micro and macroeconomic environment. In fact, if a start-up
aims to achieve high in the long run, scalability should be in its DNA.
A young entrepreneur high on passion and less on experience cannot
easily understand the need for scalability of his/her business. But a
coach or mentor can never ignore it. So, incubators must help start-ups
in adopting a flexible and agile framework through counseling as well as
devising feasible modules.

Value addition : Start-up incubation is not only about immunisation of a
business through appropriate funding, availability of space, recruitment
of top management and exploration of market. The most promising
attribute for any start-up is 'value addition', which offers an edge
over its competitors. Usually, incubators serve all the needs. Such
confined services can never ensure a better future. In contrast,
incubators, that help start-ups in increasing their market share with
value-added products or services, always succeed in achieving mutual
goals.

5 Steps to Build a Strong Start-up Brand In 2023

The Telegraph (India)

February 28, 2023 Tuesday

It's difficult to comprehend that COVID-19 has been around for so long.
Despite the world having settled into the new normal, the consequences
are still having an influence on corporate operations all across the
world. It has become difficult for new brands to create a unique
identity from scratch. Questions like how the brand should appear? What
emotions should it evoke in viewers? Will my intended audience find it
appealing? When you begin to consider how to link the dots between what
you're selling and who you're attempting to reach, questions like these
unavoidably arise. Because the pandemic created new challenges for
businesses of all sizes, there are methods to use the lessons acquired
in the past years to develop a strong strategy for 2023 and beyond.

Here are 5 steps you need to follow to create a strong brand identity
for your company, regardless of whether you are starting with a business
concept or want to change the direction of your current brand design.

A proper plan is vital for a company's success. For the first time,
writing a business plan may seem intimidating, but it is just writing
down whatever ideas you have in your head. The ideas should cover both
your short-term and long-term goals for the start-up. The short-term
plan can be the strategy execution plan, and the long-term plan is all
about the growth that you anticipate for the business, which can be
flexible, but one should attempt to be as precise as possible. Working
on the plan doesn't mean that you cannot change it in the near future.
There can be instances where there is a change in the plan, but that's
what makes it an essential aspect of building a successful startup.

Business is all about relationships, since your network will propel your
company to the next level. The power of word-of-mouth marketing has
never been greater. Currently, 88% of individuals trust online consumer
evaluations as much as they do recommendations from family and friends.
You should begin networking for all the correct reasons. Networking will
introduce you to a lot of fantastic talent in the future.

To be successful, you must be able to pivot and stay informed about
current trends. Many businesses fail simply because they are unable to
keep up with developments in their industry. Make a point of researching
your competition as well as the significant trends in your sector. You
don't have to respond to every change, but you must welcome the correct
change if you want to succeed.

Running a business is difficult, and you must surround yourself with the
appropriate people. Mentors and strategic partners will be essential
throughout this early stage of growth. The perfect team can help you
achieve far more than you could by yourself. If you want to transform
your company, you must assemble the right team. Part of it is due to
networking, but it also has to do with recruiting the proper people in
the first place. Create an environment in which everyone participates to
create a healthy company culture. You can accomplish a lot if you work
together.

It is essential to maintain a healthy work-life balance, as it is often
difficult for a startup entrepreneur to step away from their company.
However, you can and should. Maintaining your interests and relaxation
will keep you feeling refreshed for longer and help you prevent burnout.
Your company can function without you for a while, whether through
auto-pilot or delegation of employees.

Founders who want their businesses to thrive must be able to be
adaptable, maintain a good work-life balance, and surround themselves
with the appropriate people. Even with the above-mentioned methods in
place, success is never guaranteed. Startup failure is incredibly
typical, with 90% of firms failing within the first five years, but by
using these tactics, you can improve your chances of success.

13 start-ups go belly-up during the Covid-19 period

Newstex Blogs

Inability to raise funds, lack of agility and talent, and leadership
conflicts hit firms

On the one hand, the country has been adding unicorns at a fast pace,
while on the other it has dead-pooled many. As the pandemic raged, 13
start-ups — all of them founded in 2020 — went belly-up between March
2020 and May 2021.

The firms starting with SOLOSOS to Designing Mafia and SGB Global Tech
were from across the country, while Uttar Pradesh topped the charts with
five companies, followed by Tamil Nadu with two firms, according to data
collated by research firm Tracxn.

'The failure of some start-ups is not primarily on account of their
business models not being viable, but a combination of other factors
also, amongst them the most crucial being their inability to raise the
next round of funding at the opportune moment. Starts-ups generally tend
to scale their businesses at a rapid pace, looking to achieve a
leadership position, in their respective domains sooner than later,'
banker and investor Rajiv Dadlani told BusinessLine .

'As they rapidly accelerate growth, they tend to burn more cash, hence
are dependent on constant fund-raising — such as Series A, B, C and D
rounds,' Dadlani, who had invested in more than 50 companies, said.

Less compared to last year

The companies winding-up operations during these 14 months were much
lower compared with fiscal 2020 (April 1, 2019-March 31, 2020), when 284
companies were dead-pooled in India. Of these, 278 start-ups were
operational from 2010 onwards. 'One of the most important reasons is the
start-ups' lack of agility to transform in these Covid-19 times and rise
to the expectations of the customers, with the absence of adequate
talent and competency for execution as they never paid top dollars.
Further, there were also leadership conflicts that led to many a
failure, despite the fact those companies were successful in raising
funds,' said Dhianu Das, co-founder, Agility Venture Partners, said.

'Also in certain cases, the founders lacked focus and concentration,'
Das, an investor in 40 early-stage start-ups, said.

Fourteen start ups — including Moglix, Urban Company, ChargeBee and
Gupshup among others — has joined the unicorn club in this calendar
year, the latest being Zeta, a banking tech start-up co-founded by
billionaire and serial entrepreneur Bhavin Turakhia.

Investing or Focusing on AI Does Not Alone Assure Success

Indian Technology news

May 2, 2019 Thursday

May 02 -- Two articles in today's US print edition of the Financial
Times highlight the simultaneous offer of promise and peril that AI
brings. One article describes the meteoric rise of a start-up; the other
the failure of another.

In 'Robotics start-up Anki reaches end of the road' we here of a small
firm laying off all its workers today after failing to negotiate new
investor support. This was after raising $200m and triple digit millions
in revenue.

I am an early customer of Anki. In fact I purchased one of its first
racing car games. It is pretty cool: drivers control the car with
software on their smart phone and they can engage the AI 'driver' to
take over and race around the track. You, or the AI driver, can "zap"
other cars going around the track to get an advantage. Accessories
included different cars with unique designs, lights and different
"skills", and ever challenging tracks. Young kids loved playing with it;
though for me Scalextric remains the best.

In 'Fundraising sees valuation of robotic software group UiPath soar to
$6.4bn', we read of a start-up closing a new round of funding by Coatue
for $567m. The total raised is now about $1bn. One might suggest that
when debt becomes so high, banks and everyone else is on your side to
get you to victory. Perhaps Anki's failure was that they never aimed
high enough with super high investment rounds. Here is the Venturebeat
article.

Despite the star attraction of investment backers including Marc
Andreesen of Andreesen and Horowitz, and J.P. Morgan, Anki just didn't
satissfay a market need that was willing to pay for its application of
AI. Maybe the innovators were too early. Maybe the technology was still
immature. Maybe UiPath will go through the same observation and
experience - who knows.

Either way it is interesting to see two organizations focused on
leveraging AI on divergent paths. Focusing on AI is not a guarantee of
success. Focusing on a real market need remains a requirement. Despite
the promise of new technology (or silver bullets), the peril related to
the lack of basic business model remain persistent.

Dream, determination, defeat - six lessons in analysing startup failure
from a candid entrepreneur story

The roller-coaster journey of Indian shoe brand D:FY is well-captured in
this compelling book by entrepreneur-investor Prashant Desai. Here are
some key lessons and tips for founders.

Launched in 2012, YourStory's Book Review section features over 325
titles on creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and digital
transformation. See also our related columns The Turning Point, Pivot
and Persist, and Storybites.

While startup success stories can be truly inspirational, there is a lot
to learn as well from founder failures, mistakes, and misfortune.
Forewarned is forearmed, and the lessons of hindsight and research can
help founders avoid failures on their part as well.

Valuable founder lessons are offered in the book, The Biography of a
Failed Venture: Decoding Success Secrets from the Blackbox of a Dead
Startup, by Prashant Desai.

"Success is celebrated, failure is overlooked. There is fame when one
succeeds, failure is shamed. While stories of success attract, those of
failures are expunged," Prashant begins, in his compelling tell-it-all
and tell-it-like-it-is saga.

Here are my key takeaways from this 240-page book. See also my reviews
of the 10 related books Fail-Safe Startup, The Other 'F' Word, The Messy
Middle, Who Blunders and How, Adapt, The Up Side of Down, The Wisdom of
Failure, Fail Better, Fail Fast, and Failing to Succeed.

News of mistakes rarely makes it to the press, but fortunately there are
conferences like FailCon that help entrepreneurs analyse failure. See
also my articles on Eight lessons in failure from Amani Institute's Fail
Faire and Exit Plan B: Where is your parachute? 15 tips for winding down
your startup.

Prashant Desai is a Senior Director at Everstone Group, an India-focused
South East Asia investment firm. He is also seconded to Burger King as
head of strategy and investor interface.

In 2017, Prashant launched Indian sports brand D:FY, and brought on
board Rajiv Mehta, who started Puma India. The brand brought on board
celebrities from the worlds of Bollywood and cricket, and launched
simultaneously in seven cities.

Unfortunately, in 30 months, the business lost Rs 30 crore. It also
wiped out much of Prashant's earnings for nearly 30 years.

The book captures the entrepreneur's personal and professional journey
across five phrases, catchily described in '5 Ds' - desire, dream, dare,
determination, and defeat.

Founder story

Prashant lost his father at a young age, and the economic hardships led
to a single-minded focus to become wealthy. He excelled in accounting
and finance, and moved from Kolkata to Mumbai to work with the likes of
Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Kishore Biyani.

"I began using income, wealth, and a professional career as the only
metrics to measure my success," Prashant writes, describing in great
detail his business and personal journey. His story also parallels the
rise of India's growth story from the late 1990s onwards.

"Greed was a good teacher. It created a sense of hunger. It enhanced
focus. It encouraged perseverance. It incentivised discipline," Prashant
explains. But the other side of greed led to his eventual downfall.

He became CEO and MD of Financial Technologies, and then the
entrepreneurial bug bit when he decided to become even more wealthy by
launching his own D:FY sports brand. Shoe designers were roped in from
the US, with manufacturing in China.

In a big-bang launch, they opened 17 stores in seven cities, with
celebrities on board such as Anil Kumble and Farhan Akhtar. Online
partnerships were signed with Amazon. But due to a series of
miscalculations and blunders, the venture wrapped up in 2019.

Insightful observations and founder tips are shared across the 33
chapters, but the key takeaways are captured in the chapter titled
Reflections. Here are some highlights.

1. Wealth and purpose

"Wealth creation should have been a by-product and not the core
purpose," Prashant reflects. This was probably a result of the financial
hardships he faced in childhood - but a batsman cannot expect to go from
50 runs to 500, he writes.

"The original desire of creating a fitter India had been elbowed off
stage by the prospect of getting rich enough fast enough," he writes.
His goal of Rs 200 crore of personal wealth should not have become the
singular purpose of his existence.

"The lack of clarity between vision (cannot be achieved) and mission
(roadmap) led to the downfall of my company and my net worth," he adds.

2. Customer insights

Prashant assumed that what worked for him and his friends would work for
his customers as well, in terms of shoe design and pricing. He learnt
the hard way that customers would not ignore price, solidly support an
Indian shoe brand, or wear sports shoes only for running.

As it turned out, many Indians wear foreign shoe brands for their
convenience and comfort in walking, not running. While they did consider
foreign brands expensive, they would wait to buy them at sales during
the end of the season.

It's not enough to have a technically sound and aesthetically pleasing
product. It's not enough either to spot and ride broader economic and
social aspirational trends.

"My mistake was to equate the Indian customer with the Chinese customer.
China has also prided on wearing Chinese. Indians prided on wearing
'imported'," Prashant writes, describing his early analysis of China's
successful ANTA shoe brand.

In hindsight, Prashant cites Kishore Biyani in this regard: "Shelf test
is better than self-test." He cites another good quote from Warren
Buffet: "The street knows the price of everything and the value of
nothing."

3. Arrogance

Prashant explains that his string of rapid business successes in his
early years fueled a sense of arrogance. "Since I had grown rapidly, it
was only reasonable to assume that the momentum would sustain," he
recalls.

Early product validation from his friends fed his ego, and he ignored
the views and advice of dissenters. "I was a victim of the need for
confirmation bias," Prashant describes.

Ultimately, the business became unsustainable. "We had possibly bitten
off more strategically than we could chew operationally," he adds.

4. Lack of prudence in risk-taking

While risk-taking is part of an entrepreneur's journey, there were not
enough checks and balances for Prashant, and plenty of miscalculations.

Growth should have begun in an asset-light manner, and eventually
evolved into a mix of online retail, exclusive stores, and departmental
stores. Some funds should have been set aside as reserves.
Unfortunately, there was "no intellect or courage to offer a contrarian
opinion" within the company.

Bringing in investor capital early on would have shared the risk as
well. "Promoters need skin the game, but not the entire skin," Prashant
affirms. Delay in getting the backing from one corporate group when
funds could have been raised from other investors led to a fatal
financial setback at the final stages.

He should have followed the advice of Utpal Seth from RARE -- to start
small, experiment, make affordable mistakes, keep adapting, strengthen
the business, reach the sweet spot, and only then step on the
accelerator.

For example, challenger brand Sketchers started off in the walking
category, and then moved on to easy-to-slip-into sporty shoes.

Prashant also cites Rakesh Jhunjhunwala in this regard: "Make a mistake
you can afford so that you live to make another one."

5. Brand building

"We overspent on building of the brand than the brand spend itself,"
Prashant explains. Crores were spent on celebrity ambassadors, creative
agencies, film shoots, and campaigns across all media.

"We felt the brand could be built instantly," he recalls. Unfortunately,
the brand message was scattered and drowned out. Perhaps focusing on one
medium first may have helped, Prashant reflects.

6. Team

"In building the D:FY team, I selected familiarity over competence. What
I gained in terms of integrity and commitment I lost on ideas and
experience," Prashant writes.

He chose friends and family in key positions, with lack of clarity on
roles and responsibilities. Errors which should have been reported ended
up being ignored due to expectations of respect.

"There was no review meeting everyday where such challenges could be
shared or acted upon," he recalls. There were too many assumptions that
were not surfaced or challenged, which led to blunders and
underperformance.

Prashant candidly admits that his own temper was also not good for the
team or the company. His frustration with lack of business progress
prevented him from being empathetic with his team.

The road ahead

Prashant hopes his book on entrepreneurial failure will lead to valuable
learnings and dialogues in the business community on how to assess and
bounce back from failure.

"When we make mistakes, we deny, defend, ignore, and blame them on
someone else. As a culture, we have not developed tools for accepting
our mistake," Prashant observes. (See also our pick of Top Quotes of the
Year on Failure Lessons, from 2021, 2020, and 2019.)

"We are mistaken about what it means to make a mistake," he adds. "Our
capacity to forget mistakes takes precedence over remembering them."

"Mistakes help us see things differently. However, we have to see
mistakes differently first," Prashant emphasies.

In sum, this book is an example of what it takes for entrepreneurs to
see their mistakes differently, and have the courage not just to admit
errors, but share them with the broader community for their own benefit.

Will SETU help India to build more unicorns?

MINT

September 11, 2022 Sunday

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Sept. 11 -- In a bid to connect Indian startups with the
US-based investors, SETU programme (Supporting Entrepreneurs in
Transformation and Upskilling) has been launched by Union Minister
Piyush Goyal. SETU will act as a bridge between American and Indian
companies. The start-up will help entrepreneurs in upskilling,
transforming and leveraging the success stories of the Indian diaspora
in the US, Goyal said after launching the start-up in San Francisco.

Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on
Saturday said that nearly 25 per cent of the start-ups in the Silicon
Valley were managed by people of Indian origin and it was a matter of
pride.

Raghunandan Saraf. Founder & CEO, Saraf Furniture said that as India
strives to become a world-class startup destination, having the right
advice at the right time is extremely crucial. "The Government of India
invites pioneers, seasoned experts, and industry leaders to give back to
the country by adding value to the journey of a startup. It is a
programme that the startup advisory council launched in India, with the
goal of supporting entrepreneurs through transition and upskilling
initiatives, particularly in tier-2, tier-3, and tier-4 towns and remote
areas," said Raghunandan Saraf.

SETU is supported by the Startup India initiative MAARG, or the
Mentorship, Advisory, Assistance, Resilience, and Growth programme,
which is a one-stop solution finder for Indian startups. The portal was
created with the intention of allowing people from all over the country
to connect with mentors. Ridhima Kansal, Director, Rosemoore said that
in guiding the startups, a mentor will provide human intelligence. It
should be noted that over 200 mentors have been successfully onboarded
on MAARG around the world to date.

The startup will assist entrepreneurs in upskilling, transforming, and
capitalising on the success stories of the Indian diaspora in the United
States, he added.

Sahil Arya, Co- Founders and Directors at Fat Tiger said that this is a
one-stop remedy programme for startups in India, designed to be
accessible from each and every region of the country in order to get
connected with a mentor.

"Its primary function is to (a) improve accessibility, (b) use
artificial intelligence for matchmaking, (c) virtually schedule
meetings, (d) host masterclasses, and so on," explained Sahil Arya

SETU is a great initiative for budding entrepreneurs who are constantly
on the lookout for good investors for their ventures.

Ankur Aggarwal, Co-Founder & Managing Director, LaunchMyCareer said
India is home to 80+ unicorns with a valuation that goes in billions,
making it an attractive market for investors around the globe,
especially in the US.

"With the right kind of mentorship available through this platform,
aspiring entrepreneurs can upskill themselves in a technically advanced
ecosystem, access investors from any part of the country, and enhance
their chances of attracting top investors for their startup businesses,"
said Ankur Aggarwal.

Delphin Varghese, Co-Founder & Chief Business Officer, Adcounty India
said SETU initiative will undeniably pave the way for several budding
entrepreneurs to take their sunrise start-ups to new heights.

He added that Getting effortless access, via MAARG, to the right
mentorship in funding, market access and commercialisation can work
wonders for Indian start-ups staving off business failures owing to lack
of experience.

India has already produced 14 unicorns in the first half of 2022
surpassing China which has the 2nd highest number of unicorns globally.
SETU would play a significant role in the realisation of Iron Pillar
Report's prediction that India will have over 250 unicorns by 2025.

Are you a tech startup? Don't fail at its distribution

Every business requires a strong distribution network to reach its
customers. Since the advancement in technology has taken place, the way
companies market themselves has completely changed. With the increased
attention on digital marketing channels, the start-ups are struggling to
channelize their time and resources in building up a strong distribution
network for their products.

Considering the technology start-ups, online market channels are highly
effective but offline channels are even more impactful. Most of the
tech- start-ups experience setbacks even before coming into market.
These setbacks are mainly the consequences of a weak strategy they opt
for their product distribution. However, once a technology start-up is
ready to commercialize and enter the market, it must determine how the
product will reach to its target customers keeping in mind the reliable
delivery, efficiency and time effectiveness.

Even before a product hits the market, it becomes highly essential for a
start-up to research and secure its distribution channel. The decision
to reach the right channel and distribution partner always creates a
dramatic impact on the sales funnel of any technology start-up.
Undoubtedly, the product with a better distribution channel always wins
over a superior product with poor distribution network.

Whether it is the strategy for social media channels or distribution
network, it is more of a hit, trial and rectifying the errors method to
meet the right standards of the product marketing. Finding the best
method out of several trials and working on rectifying the errors can be
very frustrating for the early stage technology start-ups. However, this
delay results in the increased chances of failure for the product.

The other threat to the survival of technology products comes when
start-ups focus more on distribution than to create the demand of that
product. Customers are the big investors of your products and it is
mandatory to create a high demand to keep the cash flow healthy.

In addition, to come up with an extremely competitive product in the
market, start-ups often spend most of their time in its creation.
However, a direct distribution strategy must be considered as an
important part of the creation of the product. Simply, if a company is
designing something new but is lacking in finding an effective way to
sell it might result in a big time failure.

The chances of failure increases when a technology start-up put their
100% efforts in developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and worry
about its distribution channel and costs later. Instead, following a
strategy that focuses on spending a considerable amount of resources and
time on the MVP's development and distribution.

Following such strategies can result in a significant decrease in the
chances of product failure. For any technology start-up, more than any
technology know- how, right positioning, distribution and marketing are
required to pull off a startup successfully.

When attrition becomes a headache

With employee exit levels hitting 40-50% at new-age cos, talent
retention becomes significant

Even as start-ups race ahead to raise funds, expand product lines, enter
new markets and expand globally, retaining employees and curbing
attrition remains a big problem for newbie ventures.

Start-ups admit that attrition levels are often in the 40-50% range,
much higher than seen in other sectors, and managing attrition has
become a challenge in this competitive market space.

Pragya Kumar, chief human resource officer, CarDekho Group, says,
"Attrition is one of the biggest concerns in the start-up business.
Currently, the attrition rate at Indian start-ups at junior levels can
even go up to 50%. Many times, start-ups lack a proper system to manage
and engage employees. In a run to gain wealth and popularity, they fail
to communicate the vision of their organisation to their employees,
making them demotivated.''

Start-ups are one of the leading job creators in the Indian ecosystem.
As per leading HR firm Randstad India, start-ups are slated to generate
over 3 lakh new jobs by 2020. Another statistic by Xpheno, a specialist
staffing company, states that unicorns alone, cutting across various
segments, had over

60,000 employees in FY19. CarDekho, which is aiming to become a unicorn
soon, recently announced plans to hire over 2, 000 people this fiscal.
It current have over 2, 800 employees.

"But at this point in time, the chief question is retention. Over half
the employees quit even before completing two years and this severely
impacts the start-ups when it comes to its innovation, research &
development, product development, go-to-market and ultimately growth,"
point out experts. According to a study by CB Insights, not having the
right team is the third key reason for a start-up failure globally.

Experts say to curb attrition, start-ups should adopt a two-pronged
approach, with first focusing on right hiring and then investing
revenues and efforts in retaining the candidates. "Start-ups should
start with the right hiring. They should set clear expectations and have
an honest conversation with candidates about what the job is and what it
is not, the benefits and the demanding nature of the role. This way you
will reduce chances of mismatch of expectations,'' says Vivek Prakash,
CTO and co-founder, HackerEarth.

Agrees Siddhartha Gupta, CEO, Mercer-Mettl, a leading assessment and
skills-measurement company, who says that start-ups should hire people
who believe in the vision, values and mission and will love working at
the company. "Having clarity in your recruiting process of your values
and mission will help weed out people who won't enjoy working at your
company. Understand the adaptability of the talent beforehand through
talent assessments," adds Gupta.

Once a start-up has hired 'right', the next aspect is retention.
Presently, start-ups invest about 2-3% of their revenues towards HR and
employee engagement activities. Experts say retention efforts do not
necessarily imply enhancing the HR budget, but utilising it in the most
efficient and optimal manner. And this should start by conversing with
employees in a routine fashion. "Start-ups should plug-in touchpoints
through a 30-day connect, team and one-on-one meetings, skip-level
meetings, all hands meet, etc. throughout an employee life-cycle to
ensure that the venture is listening to their talent," says Prakash.

According to Piyush Khaitan, founder of NewGrowth, they regularly
organise interactive communications (through webinar/in-person) from the
management and the leadership team in the form of town-halls, as "this
helps us build inclusiveness and transparency and enhance employee
motivation."

Secondly, structured learning and development programmes to build new
skills are necessary for employee-centric start-ups, says Kumar.
"Enabling continuous learning can enhance the meaning employees derive
from work and their level of engagement with it." According to Gupta,
start-ups could start with a mentorship programme that lets employees
interact with the top management and also allows for the sharing of
expertise, knowledge and experience. ''There should be scope for
brainstorming activities with the leadership to harness creativity and
problem-solving ability.''

Lastly, start-ups should create sound working hours. Start-ups are often
known for having odd working hours which often seep into employees'
personal time, causing frustration. "We do not endorse rigid timings or
office attendance rules and believe in having flexible leave policies.
Moreover, we have set frameworks for feedbacks and we organise learning
sessions each week. Nearly half of our employees have been with us for
over two years," says Durgesh Nandan, head of community & growth, Ithaka
Travels.

Indian start-ups' Unicorn strides

The emergence of a greater number of unicorns is beneficial for all
stakeholders as well as for employment generation A famous saying
states: "Ideas get their worth when something is done with them". During
the past decade, start-ups in India have been hitting the headlines
periodically for varied reasons. One popular reason: reaching Unicorn
status. On average, achieving the $1 billion-plus valuation takes Indian
start-ups around seven years.

Joining the initial Unicorn club are some marquee names such as
MakeMyTrip, InMobi, Paytm, Ola, BYJU'S, Cars24, Razorpay, Swiggy,
Zomato, et al. What separates them from the crowd is the right people,
tools, ideas and, most importantly, data to add value to their ideas.
Another unique factor is the regime of updating, testing and improving
their products and services as often as possible.

This persistence has hugely impressed investors, keeping a regular
stream of opportunities and demand flowing. Twenty-first-century
start-ups are backed up by innovative technology with a strong belief in
the product, vision and people. This belief has generated tremendous
value for founders, employees, investors and the economy.

The Indian start-up ecosystem is nothing short of a revolution with
$106-billion worth of value-creation by 44 unicorns, in turn creating
1.4 million direct and indirect jobs. It's not surprising that 86 per
cent of Unicorn founders are engineers from IIT. The institution made
noteworthy strides in creating an apt atmosphere that promotes
entrepreneurship. Moreover, start-ups have helped women entrepreneurs to
contribute immensely to the start-up ecosystem. These include Swati
Bhargava of CashKaro and Falguni Nair of Nykaa, who are an inspiration
for young women.

While the average time taken by several companies to become Unicorns is
seven years, this period has been reducing recently as founders with
prior founding or start-up experience enter the game. The recent Tie &
Zinnov joint release, titled 'Covid-19 and the Antifragility of Indian
Start-up Ecosystem', estimates India's Unicorns will reach 100 by 2025.

Unicorns can be spotted in a crowd of other start-ups not just by
valuations but as industry disrupters. Maintaining the first-user
advantage and exploiting every opportunity that comes their way is key
to success.

At the helm of such unicorns is strong executive leadership that makes
or breaks the company. Another notable aspect of unicorns is they are
more consumer-oriented rather than other enterprise start-ups.

The ecosystem has already gone through cycles of boom, bust, and funding
winter in the last 10 years propelled by valuation bubbles, investors'
optimism spurred by FOMO, failure of multiple emerging start-ups, and
more. Unicorns are also fuelled by IT, consumerism and innovation.
Promising business models supported by avid risk-takers contribute to
setting in motion the entrepreneurial wave. Most of these businesses are
based in Bengaluru and Delhi is the next-preferred destination while
Mumbai comes a distant third.

After the 2015 correction, investors don't just look at start-up
valuations. The focus is slowly shifting to profitability even as many
leading start-ups continue to burn significant capital annually. Despite
the many popular e-commerce brands founded in India, it is the fin-tech
space that has seen the most Unicorns so far. The disruption in the
banking and financial sector orchestrated a way for many start-ups to
bring deep tech and IP-driven ideas to the financial sector. From
e-wallets to insurance and credit, start-ups have redesigned traditional
methods of routine transactions.

The factors enabling the rise of unicorns comprise the availability of
private equity funds, increasing Internet penetration and digital
payments, more robust infrastructure and the rising pool of skilled
talent. Meanwhile, the lack of adequate indigenous risk capital has been
offset by the easy availability of foreign funds, especially private
equity.

Two start-ups, Innovaccer and Digit Insurance, have become the latest
entrants to the Unicorn club. Interestingly, despite the Covid-19
pandemic badly disrupting the Indian economy, 11 start-ups still earned
Unicorn status in 2020.

India's changing reforms and policies towards start-ups and various
government initiatives have helped the Indian start-ups scale. The
inflow of forex especially from leading tech companies such as Facebook,
Google, and Microsoft into the Indian start-up ecosystem signals the
immense potential of the domestic market.

Considering the focus on creating an Aatmanirbhar Bharat, however, the
nation's policymakers, risk-taking corporates and funding agencies need
to foster a conducive climate for ensuring easier availability of
domestic capital. Undoubtedly, it's imperative to maintain a delicate
balance between the present socio-economic drivers and the need to stay
sufficiently integrated with global markets.

As business models get more complex and interlinked, the regulators have
to play a more proactive role in formulating appropriate regulations
that encourage innovation and support emerging business models rather
than hindering innovation. Besides promoting local funding, the
government and corporate entities may need to invest in a big way
through leading academic institutions to de-risk start-up investments in
the long run.

By providing our "minicorns" (a start-up with $1 million-plus valuation)
and "soonicorns" (funded by angel investors or venture capitalists and
likely to soon join the unicorn club) the right regulatory ambience and
local sources of funding, India can create a truly innovative and
resilient economy.

Banks need a tight framework, say experts

To cover all aspects of venture funding so as to safeguard bankers'
interests

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for banks to support start-ups by
investing in ideas needs to be backed by a comprehensive framework from
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), say banking and finance industry
experts.

In the absence of such a framework that would, among other things, cover
aspects such as NPA recognition and treatment of start-up failures,
public sector banks — which are into mostly asset-based lending — would
not venture into supporting start-ups, experts feel.

The framework should be tight and well-thought-out to encompass all
aspects of venture funding so as not compromise and expose the bankers
if such investee ventures were to fail due to market forces. No banker
would want to risk depositors' money in new start-ups without
safeguards. PM Modi had, earlier this week, told bankers to invest in
ideas thrown up by the start-ups and support their growth.

Funding start-ups

'Start-up finance is nothing but venture capital finance. Venture
capital has never been part of banking. In VC, the person who takes the
risk profits if the venture succeeds and suffers losses if it does not.
The present regulatory framework does not allow banks the same
privilege. They do not profit if the investee venture profits but if it
makes losses, the bank loses money. There is a big difference and PSBs
definitely are not looking at funding start-ups', a former chief
executive of a PSB told BusinessLine . In PSBs, the monies are that of
the depositors and not that of the banker, this expert pointed out.

Venture funding

There has to be a mechanism where the PSBs' commercial banking
activities are ring-fenced from their venture funding efforts, say
experts. One way is to encourage banks to float their venture funding
entities.

PSBs are presently not allowed to do direct equity investments in
start-ups. At the most, they can set up vehicles that will do debt
funding. Even here, except for large banks like State Bank of India,
there has been very little activity by other PSBs. However, private
banks have in the recent years been taking equity exposure in fintechs
and other start-ups that they would like to partner with.

'Typically, a venture capital fund spreads its bet among a portfolio of
start-ups and if one or two among, say ten, becomes a successful
enterprise, it is able to recoup the losses made in other investee
companies in the portfolio. That is how the world of venture capital
works and it will not be easy for banks to replicate this given their
less-than-optimal skillsets in evaluating enterprises even if
regulations permit them to take equity bets in start-ups,' said a
banking industry observer.

Srinath Sridharan, Corporate Advisor and independent markets
commentator, said 'This would need the banking sector under RBI's
leadership to come up with requisite framework which encourages
entrepreneurship, ideas and reaps benefit for all the stakeholders and
also offers solutions to any hesitancy factors', he said.

Step up for start-ups

Section: COVER STORY

Length: 314 words

Byline: MG Arun

Highlight: A dearth of an encouraging eco-system makes India a difficult
country for start-ups

Body

The IT industry body Nasscom estimates that over 1,200 technology
start-ups are born in India every year. The reason behind this is
twofold-one being stunted career growth in large companies and the other
being technology enabling speed and efficiency in new ventures like
never before.

The goal behind Startup India, rolled out by the Centre in January 2016,
was to encourage start-ups by providing them tax exemptions and to
nurture an ecosystem for making India a lucrative destination for
start-ups. Startup India established a fund of Rs 10,000 crore to be
managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), to
establish incubators, introduce self-certification and offer tax
exemptions, all aimed at promoting new enterprises. However, three years
on, the story is not as upbeat as one would expect. Although 14,036
firms have been recognised as start-ups by the Department of Industrial
Policy and Promotion (DIPP), as of November 2018, only 91 start-ups have
been approved to avail tax benefits.

Although India's rank in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business 2019
survey climbed 23 places to 77 among 190 countries surveyed over the
past year, much more needs to be done to instill confidence in start-up
firms.

The 100-day plan

WHY Regulatory processes in India are extremely cumbersome, leading to
most funded tech start-ups redomiciling outside India Dearth of an
ecosystem that provides succour in early stages A start-up needs to
liaise with many agencies before it can take wings. Plus, the economic
environment is unkind to a start-up's "failures"

HOW We need to move away from the mentality of "registering" firms.
Government needs to provide access to capital and enable ease of doing
business A favourable tax regime for safeguarding intellectual property
rights and reduced tax burden is required Start-ups need to be provided

Investor sentiment on U.S. equities improved after U.S. bank regulators
said they'd make depositors whole at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature
Bank, both taken over by the FDIC, and would provide a lending facility
to backstop eligible U.S. lenders.

At 8:30 PM ET, S&P futures rose 1.5%, Nasdaq futures rose 1.5% and Dow
futures gained 1.1%. On Friday, the S&P 500 had slid 1.5%, the Nasdaq
Composite Index had dropped 1.8%, and Dow Jones Industrial average, had
declined 1.1%. after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had taken over
Silicon Valley Bank in the second-biggest ever bank failure.

"Guaranteeing all depositors under the systemic risk exemption will be
highly controversial but should quell threatened follow-on runs on
regional banks, while also preventing the failure of tech start-ups that
kept their funding on deposit at SVB," said Evercore ISI's Krishan Guha
and Peter Williams in a note to clients.

22V Research's Dennis DeBusschere commented: "The Fed/Treasury
announcement reduces NEAR TERM tail risk. The knee jerk market reaction
seems right."

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 300 Index fell 1.8% in early trading. Hong
Kong's Hang Seng Index and the Shanghai 180 Index haven't yet started

U.S. Dollar Index has slipped 0.5%.

To provide support for U.S. financial institutions' liquidity, the
Federal Reserve is creating a new Bank Term Funding Program, offering
loans of up to one year in length.
