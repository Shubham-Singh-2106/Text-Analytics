begins but they can often end there. Nailing your pitch is integral to
success. Hear from Adina Tecklu, principal at Khosla Ventures, on how to
tell your story and leave investors wanting more.

How to Capitalize on Being Coached: Ted Wang, partner at Cowboy
Ventures, comes from the legal world where he was a partner at Fenwick.
In short, he's seen his fair share of startup success and failure. At
Early Stage, Wang will explain the value of coaching for startup
founders, including the different types of coaches one might utilize,
how to choose between them, and how to get the most out of a good coach.

compelling story that puts your company into motion. In this session,
Doug Landis, former chief storyteller and GTM leader from Box,
Salesforce and Google, will share the core storytelling mechanics to
help you nail your origin, product and customer stories that will get
your company in motion.

Ghost debuts an anonymous group messaging app with ChatGPT baked in

Anonymous social apps have a history of devolving into bullying and
harassment, ultimately leading to their failure. But a new startup
called Ghost believes that putting in extra guardrails around the
anonymous experience will allow users to have fun, without the usual
downsides. To test this theory, the company has now launched its Ghost
messaging app that allows users to share an anonymous message in a group
chat with friends in order to flirt, joke, or ask questions without
revealing their identity. The app also includes a range of other
features, including the ability to ask ChatGPT a question directly
within the group chat, among other things.

The idea, explains Ghost's founder Cem Kozinoglu, was to make something
that was fun to use but that still respected a user's desire for
privacy. To accomplish this, the app uses something the app using
something it's calling "Ghost Protocol," which is a system that utilizes
zero-knowledge proofs on the end user's device. This way, the app knows
who has access to a given group chat, but Ghost - the company itself -
does not. Thanks to his entrepreneurship background, Kozinoglu
understands the motivations of social app users. Prior to Ghost, the
founder worked as the Director of Mobile at GIPHY after the company
acquired his TechStars-backed startup /Slash Keyboard. He's seen the
latest trends among teen apps, but believes there's potential to do
anonymous social in a way that's safer without enabling bad behavior.
"We started playing around with this concept, and it also fit very well
with the name 'ghost' because of anonymity," Kozinoglu explains. "But we
also know there's a dark side of anonymity. [There are] these apps
coming out - Gas [which was acquired by Discord], Slay - and they're
purely focusing on cutting the chat and giving positive feedback to your
peers...what we're doing is kind of like 'Gas meets Discord.' We want to
add different flavors of anonymous messages," Kozinoglu says. For
example, one type of anonymous message Ghost enables is anonymous
crushes. A user could say to the group they have a crush on someone
without the sender revealing their name. Then, if the other person also
has a crush on them, too, they would be able to have a private chat,
similar to Tinder.   Another type of anonymous message is designed for a
classroom group chat, allowing students to ask questions among peers who
may or may not be close friends. There are also hidden messages which
let users see who cares most about them, as the sender is alerted as to
who revealed the message. "Guess Who" messages, meanwhile, initially
hide the sender, allowing users can guess who sent the message. Not all
these types of anonymous messages are live as of yet, but Kozinoglu says
the Anon Crushes feature should be ready to ship by next week. To add
protections around anonymity, Ghost uses a moderation system that
automatically deletes any Ghost message (anonymous message) if at least
two people report it. If the same bad actor then sends two ghost
messages that get reported, the app will block their anonymous identity
in that particular group chat. That is, the app doesn't block the user
themselves from the group chat, only their ability to post anonymously
to the group. (In fact, the app itself doesn't even know which user to
block because of its use of the Ghost protocol. It only knows which
anonymous identity to restrict.) Finally, if the bad actor gets reported
across three different groups, resulting in bans of their anonymous
identity, they're no longer able to use "ghost mode" in any group chat.
The Ghost branding appears alongside other features, as well, like the
ability to be online but invisible, which is called Ghost Status. Its
group chats are limited to 50 users so they don't get overly large, as
on Telegram. The idea is that users should actually know one another in
some way. This is enforced by requiring users to allow the app to access
their contacts - and there's no way to skip this permission request.
Another fun and timely feature is the ability to use ChatGPT (the
ChatGPT-3.5-turbo model) from within the group chat, which allows users
to ask the chatbot questions and interact with the bot as a group. "It
is one of the first [use cases of] multi-player ChatGPT inside a group
chat, Kozinoglu said in a follow-up email. "It is fully context-aware.
It has been one of the most used features," he added. Kozinoglu says the
goal is to not replace other messaging apps, necessarily, but to become
known for the format it's introducing. "In Snapchat's case, they owned
disappearing messages," he notes. "In our case, we want to own anonymous
messages - any flavors of anonymous messages - and be an alternative
place where it's fun. It's fun to be anonymous. It's fun to be able to
talk to others and allow you to do pure freedom of speech," Kozinoglu
says. The latter is particularly important to the Turkish founder, who
knows first-hand the difficulties around being able to express yourself
under a government rule that cracks down on free speech. The company
behind Ghost, Catch Social, was actually founded three years ago but had
originally been developing a different product focused on adding chat to
a crypto wallet-to-wallet application. A prior co-founder, also from
GIPHY, had worked on that project but left the startup around six months
ago. There are now 9 employees, including 2 contractors. To date, Ghost
has raised $8 million across two seed funding rounds from investors
including Slow VC, Coinfund, General Catalyst, Betaworks, DreamMachine,
Afore VC, 186 VC, D4, and various angels like GIPHY founder Alex Chung,
Wayne Chang, Jeff Siebert, and others. Some of that money is being spent
now on customer acquisition - Ghost is doing a lot of TikTok marketing.
But Kozinoglu says they've gotten Ghost's customer acquisition costs
down to 15 cents per install and are now focusing more on working
influencers, not just running ads. With the increased demand for ChatGPT
following the launch of GPT-4 and news from Microsoft around Bing, Ghost
is focusing more heavily on its own ChatGPT features, which it's calling
"Ghost Question." The startup is waiting on ChatGPT 4 access, Kozinoglu
notes. The Ghost app had a waitlist of over 50,000 sign-ups pre-launch.
It has since attracted 30,000 installs following last week's public
launch and is now hovering around No. 50 in the U.S. App Store's Social
Networking category.

Australia v India 2018-19: One change India need to make for the 3rd ODI

New Delhi, Jan. 17 -- After a successful run chase at Adelaide, India go
into the final ODI at Melbourne with the series at stake. Although they
fought hard to chase down a formidable total, not all departments
clicked as a team for the Men in Blue. Therefore, India should consider
making one change, primarily keeping the World Cup in mind.

Virat Kohli must find a way to bring in Kedar Jadhav into the playing
XI. In the last two ODIs, India has gone in with five bowling options.
The unsuccessful experiment in the first ODI of using Ambati Rayudu as
the sixth bowler was an abject failure.

In the current starting line-up, with Rayudu having been reported for
suspect bowling action, it leaves Kohli with no option for a backup
bowling option if any of the five front line bowlers has an off day.
Although Rayudu can roll his arm over until a testing, he may not be the
best option.

In the first two ODIs, the third seamer was a problem area as well, as
Khaleel and Siraj both proved to be quite expensive.

In his early days as an international cricketer, Rohit used to bowl a
bit, and so did Kohli. But neither of them has bowled for a long time,
and they would not like to risk an injury trying to hone their bowling
skills now, with the World Cup just a few months away.

Hence, it is important that India must have at least one batsman in the
top six who can provide some sort of bowling option. In the present
squad, only Kedar Jadhav can provides that option. India must have a
sixth bowling option and hence, Jadhav needs to be drafted into India's
playing XI.

Apart from his bowling, his ability to score quickly and hit the big
shots with aplomb would also provide cushion to the likes of Dhoni, who
like to get their eye in early on.

As for who he would replace is something that Kohli and Shastri need to
decide upon. It could either be Karthik or Rayudu, as the top three and
Dhoni select themselves. Whoever gets dropped to accommodate Jadhav
would certainly be considered unfortunate.

But India must look at the bigger picture and use the last ODI against
Australia as well as the five ODIs against New Zealand as an opportunity
to plug a glaring hole in the XI that severely compromises India's team
balance at the moment, and could cost India dearly in the premier
cricketing event.

any flavors of anonymous messages - and be an alternative place where
it's fun. It's fun to be anonymous. It's fun to be able to talk to
others and allow you to do pure freedom of speech," Kozinoglu says. The
latter is particularly important to the Turkish founder, who knows
firsthand the difficulties around being able to express yourself under a
government rule that cracks down on free speech. The company behind
Ghost, Catch Social, was actually founded three years ago but had
originally been developing a different product focused on adding chat to
a crypto wallet-to-wallet application. A prior co-founder, also from
GIPHY, had worked on that project but left the startup around six months
ago. There are now nine employees, including two contractors. To date,
Ghost has raised $8 million across two seed funding rounds from
investors including Slow VC, Coinfund, General Catalyst, Betaworks,
DreamMachine, Afore VC, 186 VC, D4 and various angels like GIPHY founder
Alex Chung, Wayne Chang, Jeff Siebert and others. Some of that money is
being spent now on customer acquisition - Ghost is doing a lot of TikTok
marketing. But Kozinoglu says they've gotten Ghost's customer
acquisition costs down to 15 cents per install and are now focusing more
on working influencers, not just running ads. With the increased demand
for ChatGPT following the launch of GPT-4 and news from Microsoft around
Bing, Ghost is focusing more heavily on its own ChatGPT features, which
it's calling "Ghost Question." The startup is waiting on ChatGPT 4
access, Kozinoglu notes. The app had a waitlist of over 50,000 sign-ups
pre-launch. Ghost has since attracted 30,000 installs following last
week's public launch and is now hovering around No. 50 in the U.S. App
Store's Social Networking category.

GoMechanic Fraud & Due Diligence Debacles: VCs Grilled By SIDBI, Other
LPs

Inc42

India, Feb. 17 -- Even as startup investments have become a real
opportunity for high net worth individuals and institutional investors,
incidents such as the GoMechanic fraud and the liquidation of Zilingo
have dampened the enthusiasm considerably.

Limited partners in funds, including the likes of Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) which invests in alternative
investment funds (AIFs) are now grilling VCs about their due diligence
process and why certain irregularities escaped attention for so long.

Sources close to a SEBI-registered AIF with SIDBI backing have told
Inc42 that the regulatory body has questioned some VCs that had backed
GoMechanic in the past.

This after some investors such as Mumbai-based Orios Venture Partners,
which holds about a 17.14% stake in the startup, had already written
down their investment in GoMechanic.

While a loss on the books is not unprecedented for VCs given the rate of
failure of startups, the questions from SIDBI raises potential
implications on startup fundraising, LP disclosure norms and greater
scrutiny from government agencies.

Of course, given that SIDBI invests in AIFs through the Fund of Funds
(FOF) and other dedicated government funds, the larger question is how
such scrutiny might hurt the Indian startup story.

SIDBI Scrutiny Amid GoMechanic Fraud

While SIDBI is not the only LP asking questions, the fact is that the
Finance Ministry has jurisdiction over the bank and as such VCs are
concerned about the potential regulatory overhang from SIDBI's
involvement.

Last July, SEBI had reportedly conducted surprise checks at the offices
of 20+ AIFs, including private equity (PE) funds and hedge funds, to
check if they were in compliance with certain aspects of the securities
laws.

The current matter involving GoMechanic is complicated by the fact that
at least one founder of the company has admitted to the fraud publicly.
This makes it easy for LPs to question VCs directly, whereas in previous
cases such as BharatPe, Zilingo or even Trell, the individuals involved
have defended themselves against allegations of fraud. This also gives
authorities bigger teeth in any potential action against GoMechanic.

GoMechanic cofounder Amit Bhasin publicly admitted to committing "errors
in judgement" in financial reporting while trying to pursue growth in a
chain of events which started with the startup firing 70% of its staff.
GoMechanic's management inflated sales and underreported costs incurred
to secure a higher valuation, as per the investors in the company that
Inc42 has spoken to.

GoMechanic, the startup's investors and SIDBI did not respond to
questions from Inc42 about the details sought by the government-backed
MSME-focussed bank.

"This opens the door for SIDBI and other LPs to ask questions about our
other investments. And SIDBI's connection means there is a government
connection. It could seriously impact even those founders that have been
building their business honestly," a Delhi-based early stage investor
told Inc42.

In 2022, the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) committed INR 7,980 Cr to
99 alternative investment funds. Of the total amount committed, INR
3,400 Cr was disbursed to 72 AIFs, which in turn made investments worth
INR 14,077 Cr in 791 startups,

Investors Brace For Losses

Among the key backers of GoMechanic, Orios Venture Partners is the
second-largest institutional stakeholder, with Sequoia Capital being the
largest stakeholder in the company.

According to reports about the written down investment, Orios' exposure
from Fund II was 7.79% of the committed corpus, at last round's
valuation and the assets represented around 1.27x of the fund's multiple
on invested capital (MOIC).

Investors, including Sequoia India, have initiated a forensic audit of
the startup's books to understand the true picture of the fraud. Both
KPMG and PwC had conducted audits in the startup in previous years, but
did not report any discrepancies.

Besides Sequoia India and Orios, GoMechanic has investors such as Tiger
Global, Chiratae Ventures and has raised more than $55 Mn since
inception till 2021. Further, it has also raised debt from the likes of
Stride Ventures, which is said to be managing the potential exit
opportunities for investors.

Due Diligence Becomes An LP Problem

According to AIF founders that Inc42 has spoken to, SIDBI has so far
never looked to question fund managers on their due diligence process or
investment decisions. "SIDBI might have an ear in the investment
committee, but they never interfered with the decisions as a policy. I
believe this has been a policy for the past several years," said the
founder of a Chennai-based SIDBI-backed AIF, requesting anonymity.

However, the founder added that SIDBI is just like any other LP at any
other VC fund, who would want to hold fund managers accountable for any
lapses.

LP confidence has been severely dented by the potential fraud at
GoMechanic, and other due diligence-related issues since early 2022 at
startups such as BharatPe, Zilingo, Trell and a slew of corporate
governance problems at startups where investors are on the board.

Further, the likes of Infra.Market and WazirX have seen probes from tax
and economic offences authorities. Founders have been accused of
mismanaging VC funds either by reckless expansion into new verticals or
overhiring.

While the global macroeconomic slowdown had already brought in the
startup funding winter, these potentially damaging issues and the
involvement of government-backed LPs threaten to strain the funding
outlook further.

SIDBI, Other LPs appeared first on Inc42 Media.

ADDRESSING the participants at the TiE Nagpur event on 'Startup
Accelerator SIG Series' held here recently, Ramakrishna, Chairman, and
Co-founder of an XYK no Capital, said more than 98 percent of the
startups fail in the first year of operation due to various reasons. He
highlighted that lack of product, market fit, cash crunch, and talent
deficit are some of the major parameters that are responsible for the
failure.

The was organized by TiE Nagpur in association with E-Cell VNIT and Zone
Startup India.

Ramakrishna further emphasized on creating an ecosystem for the
startups. "Startups have typical challenges that need to be dealt with
differently. And thus all the stakeholders should collaborate to solve
the challenges of startups," he said.

Ramakrishna also said that the startups should be raised like a child
and spoke about how TiE Nagpur and other organizations are supporting
startups in and around Nagpur.

Ashmita Moon, Programme Head - Impact Program, who is a global brand of
Tech Accelerator, moderated the panel discussion on various challenges
and solution of startups.

While initiating the discussion, the panelists expressed their views on
the current scenario of the ecosystem for startups in the region. Prof.

incubated 10 women incubate and shared his views on various promising
sectors.

Dr Nitin Labhsetwar, Chief Scientist, Head Energy, and Resource
Management Division, spoke about the national and international
ecosystem. At an international level, there is a practice of do IPR of
their startup idea which is not implemented in India, he said.
Labhsetwar further spoke about opportunities in the health and energy
sectors and assured to provide all possible support to the participants.
Dr R P Vijaya Kumar, Professor In-charge of E-Cell, VNIT, shared his
views on the changed education system and the need to support students
from the initial level. Rama Krishna said the owners of startups should
learn lessons from their failures. "If a startup fails, the founder has
more chances of success in future," he observed.

The panelist and mentors discussed strategies, ecosystem and tactical
guidance the startups are looking for. Kartik Borkar, Secretary TiE
Nagpur, proposed the vote of thanks. Nidhi Bawsahe, Executive Director,

The truth about management in Silicon Valley: It doesn't exist

February 11 -- The tech industry is home to some of the world's greatest
innovators, most profitable and valuable companies, and incredible
startup success stories. But, these achievements notwithstanding, it's
also a space where there's a surprising lack of appreciation for skilled
management.

I founded three companies and have worked in the tech industry for 15
years, and I learned a lot of this firsthand through my experiences
building Shift. If I could go back to when we launched in 2014, there
are a lot of things I'd do very differently in terms of how we set up
our culture - understood as the type of behavior that is rewarded and
encouraged versus discouraged and penalized - and developed management
practices.

 

From my observations, lack of proper management leads to the failure of
many great startups and ideas. More importantly, it's contributing to
the scarcity of engineering talent and, in turn, the rising
people-related costs of building companies. That puts Silicon Valley at
a disadvantage.

What works for tech monopolies doesn't work for everyone elseAt first
glance, you might think that some of Silicon Valley's best technology
companies are incredibly well-managed. In practice, though, many of them
are one-product wonders. They've figured out one product and have built,
some would argue, a monopoly around that product.

This is certainly true of both Google and Meta (formerly Facebook), both
of which have one primary revenue stream (digital ads), and both of
which have largely failed at building new products outside of
acquisitions (Google Maps and Android being possible exceptions, though
both started as early-stage acquisitions).

Because these companies command incredible pricing leverage in their
respective advertising businesses, they can continue to dump nearly
unlimited resources into attempts to build new products and take out
potential competition through acquisitions - all while hiring any and
every engineer they can get their hands on.

But this issue goes beyond just these two prominent corporations. It is
fairly widespread across large tech companies throughout Silicon Valley.

There may be talk about objectives and key results in tech companies,
but often these goal-setting frameworks are just words without any
teeth.

 

When the bottom line almost does not matter, the result is too much
leeway and too little accountability. It is wasted resources and stalled
innovation. If companies effectively utilized their existing talent,
they would be able to produce the same, if not better, results. There
would be fewer failed products, ultimately freeing up talent to work on
more impactful tasks and produce greater innovation.

I would even venture that many technology companies could eliminate 20%
to 40% of their workforce with very little change to the bottom line.
However, this would require getting work done with far scarcer
resources, which would, in turn, require management (aka prioritization;
the ability to start small, experiment, and only after testing and
learning going big on a product; and greater control of the product
initiatives and business through profits and losses).

With better management, companies would also see a significant cut in
their out-of-control people-related costs. We all know engineering
salaries are high and keep rising, and while many tech companies with
high-margin businesses can afford to hire an excess of engineers and
other technologists, they would significantly reduce their costs if they
simply managed their existing talent better - allowing them to put
resources toward fewer initiatives and more profitable outcomes.

Of course, not all companies building great technology suffer from this
problem, with Amazon being by far the biggest and best example. It is
also Amazon, of all the large, consumer-focused tech companies, that has
been the best at innovating new products and creating new revenue
streams - Amazon Web Services, Prime Video, Marketplace, Ads, to name a
few - outside or on top of its initial retail business.

How Silicon Valley came to disdain managementThis problem isn't just a
problem of large tech companies; it's prevalent in many startups. There
is a widespread belief that good culture equals having kombucha on tap,
feeding employees gourmet food, and, pre-COVID, having an
Instagram-friendly office space.

This snowballs into a lack of accountability, which, from a management
standpoint, is extremely easy to hide. And, sure, while those are all
fun perks for many, culture should be, at its core, a consensus of the
behaviors that are rewarded versus frowned upon, encouraged versus
discouraged.

Many founders have become conditioned to believe that they will not be
able to innovate and enforce good management and accountability at the
same time. Indeed, talent wars are so intense that lots of energy is
spent on making everyone feel good about their job, not actually
delivering results. Founders have come to believe that the users will
come if and when they build a great product, rather than managing the
business through the lens of P&L, testing, and learning their way to
what that product may be.

This is easier said than done. I've made this mistake more than once in
my journey at Shift, and these mistakes cost us an insane amount of time
and money.

Yet we can - we need - to hire people who are much better managers than
many founders can be in their early days. Speaking from experience, it
is hard to be an early-stage founder (focused on product and capital)
and manager (focused on people management and accountability)
simultaneously, so you need to figure out where you succeed and where
you don't, and then fill in the gaps.

You also need coaching - early! Only through good coaching can you
recognize your blind spots and determine how to address them with the
right people around you.

Better management lets companies do more with lessYet, if great
companies are still being built - 2020 and 2021 saw some pretty
incredible IPOs - why should anyone care about whether they are
well-managed or not? There are two reasons.

First, there is an unbelievable scarcity of engineering talent. We are
doing a disservice to innovation, and to the future prosperity of the
American economy, if companies who can afford it are hoarding great
talent, even though they can accomplish the same results with fewer
engineers. This also leads to underutilized engineers stuck in humdrum
workplaces, and the scarcity of talent further exacerbates one of our
country's most pressing shortages. As a result, our ability as a nation
to stay ahead on the global tech stage is massively constrained.

Then, there is the cost issue. If you think inflation in this country is
bad overall, you should see salary inflation in Silicon Valley. Salaries
are out of control, and so is our cost of living. Many engineers are
cognizant of the issue and use it to their advantage, as they should.
But these problems continue to feed into each other like a vicious
cycle. This, of course, impacts businesses, especially startups, which
end up needing a ridiculous amount of funding to pay for all of this.

There is an enormous opportunity for Silicon Valley companies to change
their mindset on management. The first step is for founders to hire and
surround themselves with people who embrace management and think about
business through accountability and P&L. Recruit leaders who are
experienced managers or seek the support of a management coach or
consulting firm. When you think you need another engineer, pause and
consider if what you really need is a manager to get more out of your
existing engineers.

Second, leaders should focus on developing and managing their existing
talent, such as matching employees with the right growth opportunities,
reorganizing teams, setting goals, and holding leaders and employees
alike accountable for meeting them.

What I'm proposing is a paradigm shift, one that is going to take time.
Obviously, one or two companies implementing better management won't
change this issue overnight.

However, the work culture in Silicon Valley as we know it today
originated and evolved from just a few companies. If, over the next
decade, we see more well-managed, Amazon-style businesses being built,
it would completely shift Silicon's Valley culture and, as a result, how
this industry - and country - is managed overall.

The 11 types of business failure - and how you can learn from the
mistakes of others

Founders and business professionals can learn a lot about the failure
landscape from Robin Banerjee's new book, Who Blunders and How: The Dumb
Side of the Corporate World. The eleven chapters are written in a
conversational style and span 265 pages, full of examples, analysis and
tips.

Humans and organisations are not immune to blunders. From startups to
established brands, many companies have made serious mistakes, and
decayed or disappeared. There are examples abound from India and around
the world: Kodak, Ambassador cars, BlackBerry, Lehman Brothers
Kingfisher Airlines, and many more.

Robin Banerjee, MD of Caprihans India, has 35 years of experience in
MNCs in India and overseas. He was at Hindustan Unilever,
Arcelor-Mittal, Thomas Cook, Essar Steel, and Suzlon India. He is also
the author of Who Cheats and How: Scams, Frauds and the Dark Side of the
Corporate World.

Here are my key takeaways from the eleven chapters of the book. See also
my reviews of the related books The Other 'F' Word,Adapt,The Up Side of
Down,The Wisdom of Failure,Fail Better,Fail Fast,andFailing to Succeed.

While much can be learned from business success stories, there is a lot
to learn from mistakes, failures, blunders, errors, lapses, traps,
snags, bad judgment, mistiming, malpractice, deceit, fraud, and foibles
as well, Robin begins. Forewarned is forearmed, and the lessons of
hindsight and research can help avoid failures on your part as well, and
prevent the destruction or erosion of value.

News of mistakes rarely makes it to the press, but fortunately, there
are conferences like FailCon that help entrepreneurs analyse failure.
See also my articles on Eight lessons in failure from Amani Institute's
Fail Faire and Exit Plan B: Where is your parachute? 15 tips for winding
down your startup.

"Mistakes are inevitable but learning lessons is optional," Robin
cautions. "To err is human. The lessons are priceless," he emphasises.

Missing the innovation bus

Innovation is a continuous journey, but many successful companies have
failed to adapt to changing times or come up with flops. "Innovation is
the calling card to the future," Robin explains. Companies need
incremental as well as breakthrough innovations.

Diversification of offerings does not always succeed, as seen in the
case of Harley-Davidson perfumes and Colgate's frozen dinners. Invention
without business development is not effective, as seen in Xerox.

The inability to assess the strength of new entrants led to the decline
of the Blackberry. And not all companies are willing to cannibalise old
offerings in the face of their own new inventions, as shown in the
demise of Kodak.

Some products were launched too late, such as EMI's CAT scanner. Without
sustained enhancements, innovations cannot compete effectively, as seen
in the case of GoPro. Quality and performance are not the sole
guarantors of success; German luxury car giants will need to take on the
shift to electric cars, self-driving, and shared mobility.

Mismatched positioning and pricing can bring down well-intentioned
products, such as the Tata Nano. Financial constraints posed challenges
to some companies, like Bombardier and Hawker Beechcraft.

"Innovation is about anticipating the future, responding to changing
customer needs, or creating a new need for customers to consume.
Organisations need to rekindle the innovation magic of
entrepreneurship," Robin emphasises.

This calls for taking failure in stride and being open to learning from
failures. "Failures are harbingers of success," he explains. If you do
not fail, you are not trying enough," Robin cautions. Companies must
find out how to "flourish from fiascos".

He advises companies to be flexible, inspire creativity, encourage
employees to experiment, cultivate talent diversity, and design a career
path for innovators. Successes in this regard include Google, 3M and
Microsoft Xbox.

Incorrect business models

Changes in technology and customer preferences call for frequent changes
to the business model. At a global level, there are both cyclical as
well as structural changes, Robin observes, pointing to China's economic
power as an example. Tech disruptions to watch are Internet of Things
(IoT), drones, automation, and 3D printing, along with new business
models like the sharing economy.

Digital models like ecommerce have challenged the likes of HMV, Borders,
Toys 'R' Us, Nordstrom, and the Future Group. Health consciousness is
putting pressure on tobacco and sweet soda manufacturers.

One challenge that companies face is knowing when to stick to
established formulas and when to switch to new ones. This has been seen
in Coca-Cola's experiment with New Coke, and JC Penney trying to drop
the discount model.

Useful business tools in this regard are BCG's growth-share matrix. It
divides business segments into cash cows, stars, dogs, and question
marks. The 80-20 principle is also applicable to market analysis.

Robin documents a number of failure reasons for startups. They include
demand-supply mismatch, inadequate capital or cash burn, poor marketing,
co-founder conflict, lack of professionalism, competition, operational
challenges at scale, and being ahead of the time.

He advocates a mindset of change and agility, ability to re-engineer,
and capability to bounce back from setbacks. Examples include Netflix
switching from DVD rentals to streaming. Stora, founded as long back as
1288 in Finland, has evolved a range of offerings from copper to
bio-materials.

Founder and CEO blunders

"Bossy bloopers" abound, Robin observes, pointing to Bill Gates
underestimating the search engine market, Steve Ballmer launching Zune
too late, and Fitbit CEO James Park ignoring Apple Watch's entry. Other
examples include Ronald Johnson's errors in layoffs at JC Penney, Tony
Hayward's unrepentance about BP's oil spill disaster, the loose remarks
of Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, and Vijay Mallya's multi-million dollar
parties when Kingfisher Airlines had unpaid debts.

A number of bosses have been too autocratic for their company's good,
such as German automaker Carl Borgward, Fred Goodwin of RBS, and
Jean-Marie Messier of Vivendi. Charges of unethical conduct have been
detrimental to Phaneesh Murthy of iGate and Brendan Eich of Mozilla
Firefox.

Charismatic leaders have fared much better in this regard, Robin
explains. Leaders should be open to hearing diverse opinions and even
bad news. They should guard against slips of the tongue and antagonising
remarks.

Disputes between founders and CEOs are not uncommon either, particularly
with regard to strategy, company control, decision-making,
professionalisation, and succession planning. Examples from Infosys and
Tata Group have been well documented.

There are also successful founder-CEOs, of course, such as Jeff Bezos,
Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, and Bhavish Aggarwal. Other founders have handed
over the reins of their companies to other CEOs, such as James Dyson and
Bill Gates.

Unfortunately, research has shown that many founders have had to be
sacked due to alignment, mismanagement, or capacity problems. Examples
include Dov Charney (American Apparels) and Housing.com (Rahul Yadav).

As solutions to such issues, Robin recommends that CEOs and boards focus
on teambuilding, develop new competence in a changing world, keep a keen
eye on governance, stay focussed on the customer, and build solid
governance processes. Capability, credibility, and compassion are key
success factors in this regard.

Skimping on quality

In the mad quest for business speed or cost-cutting, many companies have
deliberately and inadvertently cut back on quality and training.
Incompetence, callousness, and disregard for warning signs are to be
blamed in many of these cases. This has led to a product recall,
regulatory fines, brand damage, business losses, the firing of
managers - and even bankruptcy in some cases.

Examples include Toyota's faulty brake incident in 2009-2010, GM's
safety lapses with ignition switches, Takata's exploding airbags,
Ranbaxy's manipulated and falsified data, Samsung's exploding Galaxy
Note 7, and contamination of cereals (Kellogg's), baby milk (Lactalis),
peanut butter (ConAgra Foods), and tablets (Tylenol).

Growth ambitions should never overtake quality consciousness, Robin
warns. The perception of quality is decided not just by the manufacturer
but the customer as well. "Quality concern erodes the edifice of trust,"
he adds.

The quality message needs to be imbibed and practised by the leader and
employee alike. "Quality is a culture, a philosophy, a faith that needs
to be practised over and over again," Robin emphasises. Acknowledgement
of errors in quality should not be denied, delayed or deflected.

Family businesses: infighting and succession

A notable proportion of small and large companies in the world are
family businesses. Some are known for their focus on long-term value and
not just short-term gains. Unfortunately, many of them don't last beyond
three generations, and there have been high-profile incidents of family
in-fighting and lack of succession planning.

Success stories of "lucky sperms clubs" (in the words of Warren Buffet)
include Ford, Dior, BMW, Suzuki, Swarovski, Samsung, Wallenbergs (ABB,
Electrolux, AstraZeneca), Ayala, Mahindra, and Bajaj.

But Italian fashion gurus Giorgio Armani and Roberto Cavalli have yet to
anoint successors in a professional manner, Robin observes. Family
infighting has plagued the Koch, Mondavi, and Ambani groups.

Other family companies that have gone awry or faced serious issues
include Warner-Lambert (pharma), Pritzker (Hyatt, Royal Caribbean Cruise
Line), Karmann (coaches), Kasturbhai Lalbhai (Arvind textiles), and
Khataus (sarees).

To become more professional, Robin advises family-run businesses to stay
away from arbitrary management styles, nepotism, and sticking to the
laurels of past glory or to outmoded practices. He recommends more
foresight, clarity on business values, and willingness to negotiate over
disputes.

Management control and ownership need to be planned for the future in a
systematic manner. "Squabbles over succession kill generational
entrepreneurship," he cautions. "Many business leaders think that they
are either indispensable, or can role from their grave," he laments.

Business disputes

Disputes over IP, contracts, business partnerships, and employee
relationships can cause serious damage to a company. Examples include
patent and design disputes (between Microsoft and Samsung; Kellogg's and
Nabisco; Britannia and ITC), labour unrest (Maruti Suzuki India),
acquisition-exit terms (NTT DoCoMo and Tata Teleservices), and business
partners (Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill of Travelers and Citigroup).

Some rivalries between business groups have led to allegations of
unethical advertising practices (Tesco, Heinz India) and even corporate
espionage (P&G on Unilever). Robin advises dispute resolution (through
mediation or arbitration), written documentation, ethical communication,
and adherence to contracts as appropriate practices in this regard.

Mergers and Acquisitions

In theory, mergers and acquisitions can yield benefits like faster and
better growth, cost savings, synergy, resource sharing, more talent and
IP, and market share. But culture clash, incompetence, lack of due
diligence, bad timing, and regulatory missteps can unravel an M&A, Robin
cautions.

Examples of botched or troubled deals include DaimlerChrysler,
VW-Suzuki, AOL-Time Warner; Microsoft and Nokia phones; HP and Autonomy;
Intel and McAfee; Daiichi Sankyo and Ranbaxy; Publicis and Omnicom;
Suntory and Beam; eBay and Skype; Kmart and Sears; and Yahoo's
acquisition of 53 companies from 2012 to 2016.

For successful M&A, Robin recommends a 'give and take' approach,
assessment of fit, and combination of complementary offerings. Each
company should be open and willing to learn from the other. Respect,
trust, and willingness to negotiate are key success factors.

As examples of successful M&A, Robin cites Walt Disney and Pixar
(creativity with financial muscle), Tata Global Beverages and Mount
Everest Mineral Water (quality and distribution network), Microsoft and
Forethought (PowerPoint in the Office suite), Thomas Cook and LKP Forex
(less duplication, more cost savings), Apple and PA Semi (specialised
chips for iOS), Facebook and Oculus (VR and gaming), Tata Tea and
Tetley.

Public relations fiascos

When blunders occur, many companies err even more through further
falsehoods, deceit, denial, wrongful allegations, hiding of data,
obfuscation, gimmickry, and even belligerence. Robin urges companies to
follow the basic principles of PR in such situations: humility,
transparency, and regret.

Examples of PR debacles have been documented during Volkswagen's deceit
in under-reporting emissions from 2006 to 2015, Bridgestone's denial of
Firestone tyre problems, BP's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, News
International's phone hacking, FIFA's repudiation of corruption claims,
United Airlines' "re-accommodation" of a passenger, and Uber's handling
of accusations about its toxic culture.

Robin advises companies to have a crisis management strategy in place.
Ownership of the mistake, repentance, empathy, prompt and unified
responses, access to leaders, compensation, and recalls of faulty
products are necessary. "Goodwill is any organisation's greatest asset,"
Robin emphasises.

Corporate governance ills

Corruption, fraud, espionage, and lack of long-term thinking has brought
down many a company, Robin observes. Examples include the Sahara Group.
Governance disputes and strategy shortcomings have also plagued
companies like Sony.

Many Indian banks and corporates have been caught in fraudulent loan
scandals; bribery of government officials has been documented as well.
Some companies have over-promised and failed to meet commitments, such
as SunEdison and Valiant Pharmaceuticals. Theranos made lofty promises
on tests that were later shown to be inaccurate.

Even ratings agencies have been accused of fraud and misleading the
public, as shown during the 2008 economic crisis when Moody's and S&P
were penalised. Indian rating agencies failed to identify financial
troubles at IL&FS.

Micro- and macro-level issues (at employee and leader levels) need to be
fixed. Robin recommends internal controls, independent directors,
splitting of the CEO and chairperson roles, third party audits, and
enforcement of legal and ethical guidelines.

The debt trap

"Debt is a double-edged sword - it helps to do business; it can also
ruin one," Robin cautions. Startups and corporates need to master the
differing contributions of equity and debt in this regard. Government
regulations are being upgraded to meet such challenges as well.

Over-reliance on borrowing leads to less room for manoeuvre. Failure to
meet payment obligations can lead to penalties, lower credit ratings,
reduction in market valuation, and negative employee morale, Robin
warns.

A notable example of the debt trap is the subprime mortgage crisis in
the US that led to the 2018 downturn. Sears has been on the deathbed for
years, and Indian companies in limbo due to insolvency issues include
Bhushan Power and Steel and ABG Shipyard.

Another Indian company that fell from grace is Videocon (Allwyn,
Kelvinator). Over-ambitious acquisitions can also lead to debt, as seen
in Suzlon Energy's purchase of German firm REpower.

Human error

Robin also documents "mortal mistakes" such as unbalanced short-term
thinking, herd mentality, mistaken judgments, missed opportunities, lack
of skills, inability to delegate, and over-optimism. This leads to the
proliferation of "me too" undifferentiated products, lack of
product-market fit, and dysfunctional micro-managed organisation.

For example, Decca Records missed out on the Beatles, and 15 publishers
rejected JK Rowlings' work. Many Indian companies prefer hiring "friends
of politicians at their request."

Robin advises professionals to have a sound management system, an
attitude of realism, relevant data and dashboards, requisite talent in
the firm, and a focus on cashflow. Plans should be action-oriented, and
assessed regularly.

The book wraps up with more tips on how to interpret and bounce back
from mistakes. "Inexperience provides us with experience," Robin
explains. Learning from mistakes is enlightening.

Instead of sticking to flawed positions, it is better to rework the
assumptions and conclusions, and cut losses. After all, humans are
fallible and at times irrational. From managers to employees, Robin
recommends that companies cultivate a culture of open dialogue,
admitting wrongdoing, seeking feedback, devising corrective steps, and
re-energising for the future.

In sum, this is a must-read book for all startups and corporates, and
offers a wealth of insights and tips into the world of business
blunders. The author ends with the adage -

"Tough times don't last; tough people do."

ORANGE BALL PEST CONTROL - The Terminators

New Business Age

April 30, 2019 Tuesday

Copyright 2019 New Business Age All Rights Reserved

Section: Vol. 18; No. 7

Length: 1103 words

Byline: MUNA SUNUWAR

Body

With the advent of the internet, people have benefitted in terms of
connectivity and access to free information. The availability of the
internet played a vital role in the development of Biddha Nanda Jha's
business venture - Orange Ball Pvt Ltd, a pest control service. He was a
part-time employee in a mobile shop situated at Mahaboudha, Kathmandu
when he first encountered the possibility of launching his pest control
business. People would make frequent visits to the agro vet (a store
that supplies pest control chemicals) in front of the shop he was
employed in. He discovered bedbugs were causing problems among people
residing in Kathmandu. "I did not feel the problem subside in any way,
and concluded that people were lagging in the proper usage of the
chemicals," Jha states. To confront the problem he researched online and
found out that separate companies dealing with such a problem existed.

"People were not following the exact procedure for effective results. I
thought of pursuing the business in Nepal to plug that gap," he adds.

Leading a Business without Business Background

Jha had the idea but had no experience in running a business, in
addition to which he had not worked in any corporate house to know about
the functionality of companies. Despite the lack of experience, he
decided to explore the business but faced problems right away. He
remembers the difficulty of finding the right heading under which the
company could be registered. The officials suggested him to register it
as a cleaning company. "We had to identify our market as people did not
know about our service. We did not prefer door-to-door marketing, rather
we waited for our clients to reach out to us first and they did," he
mentions. He took an online course and later trained and interned in
Chandigarh, India. When he started the business, he had no concept of
financial record keeping. It was the same with the seed capital; he
remembers investing Rs 50,000 in the beginning.

"The investment and earnings were not systematically recorded in the
initial phase, now we have systematic financial and client records," he
shares.

When people ask him what is different about his business, he answers by
saying it's not the idea, but his team and ways of working are
different.

Services

Orange Ball started operating from 2012 and was finally registered on
January 5, 2016. The company aggressively took over the market after the
2015 earthquake. "We were told that bugs got transmitted when people
shared beddings during the earthquake," he recalls. "Now, we get calls
from people seeking help for bedbugs, rodents, termites, and
cockroaches." Corporate clients are served on an annual maintenance
contract (AMC) while household clients are served on an oncall basis.
The service can cost between Rs 3,000 to Rs 25,000. Orange Ball's
services are available in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Biratnagar.

While a majority of the tools and equipment used for pest control are
procured from the local market, some are imported from India and Korea.
The company has served more than a hundred corporate clients and
over1,500 household clients. "Household clients are seasonal while
corporate clients are associated with the company for the whole year,"
he informs, adding, "Anyone with pest problems can be our client." The
company has six members in the team that are deployed according to the
need.

Work in Nepal

When Jha started, he felt Orange Ball's prospects in the field were
boosted by the absence of similar businesses in Nepal. "I hear people
say there is nothing in Nepal, while in my opinion, there is room here
to do so much and create space for ourselves," he opines. "There are
lots of undiscovered opportunities in Nepal as people here perceive
unique ideas positively intensifying the chances of new businesses to
flourish." He says his friends working abroad appreciate his work and
achievements. "They could achieve so much if the hard work they put into
their current job abroad is invested in Nepal," he shares.

According to Jha, Kathmandu alone has 500,000 households excluding
corporate clients and a company, in general, can deal with barely 50,000
homes annually. This sheds light on the prospects this field carries for
those who want to try this type of business in Nepal as Jha indicates
the chance of growth for the company is high. However, he suggests the
company should be equipped with an experienced workforce that is
knowledgeable about the proper handling and usage of pesticides.

The annual turnover of the company in the first year of operation was Rs
600,000, which rose by 300 percent the year after. The company secured a
turnover of Rs 1.9 million in the FY 2017/18. Jha informs the company is
aiming for a 400 to 500 percent growth in the next year and hopes to
achieve it after they expand their presence in Pokhara.

Future

As people have been introduced to the concept and they now know such a
service exists, Jha claims the future of this particular business is
bright. Along with the development in the area of professional pest
control services, the company expects to launch branches in major cities
of Nepal in the next five years. Orange Ball has plans of setting up a
branch office in Pokhara by the end of 2019 and provide clients with the
easiest access to the company's services. "We have envisioned the
agriculture sector to be systematic in a sense that different companies
would be working for different stages of harvesting and we would be
playing a part in the system in ten years," he says.

Government's Role

Startups don't always excel because of which the government should take
the initiative to manage this ecosystem. According to Jha, the
authorities concerned should formulate and implement guidelines for
entrepreneurs to start with. "Many startups fear failure and don't
register their companies right away, take us, for example, we registered
our company only in 2016 while it started operating from 2012. Had we
received genuine counselling, we would have caught up with expected
growth rate," he reminisces. "In the beginning, we were not sure if the
business idea would work, so we hesitated to register. Later, we
realised that it was late," he says. He suggests startups to be well
informed about the company registration processes and operation.

Jha believes there are many flaws in the government policies startups
that need to be amended according to the need of the time. "It would be
better if the government designated a certain probation period for
startups and if they pass the phase and feel ready, they can finally
proceed with the registration of the company," he says.

'Collaboration' is driving Arkansas startup growth

Newstex Blogs

Talk Business Politics( Arkansas)

February 6, 2019 Wednesday 12:06 AM EST

Length: 1122 words

Feb 05, 2019( Talk Business Politics:
http://www.talkbusiness.netDelivered by Newstex) As the Arkansas startup
community continues to mature entering 2019, there has been a noticeable
ramp up in collaborative efforts to boost the success of early stage
ventures in an industry where the failure rate is particularly high.
Venture Center Managing Director Wayne Miller said at some time in 2018
entrepreneurial service organizations (ESOs) in all corners of the state
began to intentionally work together and combine resources to aid the
development of early stage companies that live or locate in Arkansas to
grow their firms. Miller said those groups, including the Venture Center
and Innovation Hub in downtown Little Rock-North Little Rock, the
Conway-based Conductor program and the Startup Junkie in Northwest
Arkansas, are all dedicated to developing entrepreneurial talent and
fostering their respective local ecosystems.

But now, he said, they are more apt to work together. 'I think that one
of the things I suggest that has really happened in the last six months,
we are really trying to get in lock step,' said Miller, who took over as
the Venture Center's new executive director in November. 'Frankly, up
until then, we were fundamentally competing against each other instead
of working together.' In the Little Rock area, Miller said he,
Innovation Hub Director Chris Jones and Brent Birch, executive director
of the Little Rock Technology Park Authority, regularly discuss how to
boost the prospect of local startups. Likewise, the Conductor program
began as a public-private partnership with the University of Central
Arkansas and Startup Junkie in Northwest Arkansas to drive innovation
and entrepreneurship. 'I am excited because I have never seen this level
of collaboration,' said Jeff Standridge, a former Acxiom Corp. executive
who is now chief catalyst for the Conductor program at UCA. Both
Standridge and Jones said these groups working together are tackling
such issues as the high success-to-failure rate of local startups, the
systemic lack of access to capital for early stage companies, and other
issues highlighted in the widely-held Milken Institute's 2018 State
Technology and Science Index. That survey, published in early December,
ranked Arkansas 48th out of all 50 states and the District of Columbia
on their capabilities and competitiveness in a tech-focused economy.
'What we are trying to do is work together with local startups to
address many of these issues, such as access to capital,' said Jones
said at a recent pitch event at the Innovation Hub sponsored by local
startup catalyst Remix Ideas that highlighted local minority
entrepreneurs. ACCELERATOR PROGRAMS PAYING DIVIDENDSDespite those
challenges, Arkansas is seeing success in key niche sectors due to
recent 'accelerator programs' that have boosted the fortunes of local
startups and entrepreneurs. Across the state, accelerator programs are
taking advantage of the state's expertise in financial services,
banking, bond market, retail, trucking, agriculture, food industry, data
analytics, healthcare, supply chain and retail sectors.
Fayetteville-based Startup Junkie Consulting recently completed its
second iteration of the 10x Cyber Accelerator, a 20-week program
designed to scale Arkansas' high-growth tech and tech-enabled ventures.
The program helps scale growth-oriented ventures with annual average
revenues from $100,000 to $10 million that focus on offering
recommendations for improving software scalability and protection from
cyber threats. The Venture Center's FinTech Accelerator program has
brought global attention to Arkansas. Three years ago, the world's
largest financial technology services company, Jacksonville, Fla.-based
Fidelity Information Services Inc. (FIS), stepped in to sponsor an
annual rigorous 12-week bootcamp for early stage FinTech startups. That
curriculum included instruction on compliance, regulatory issues,
security and risk management and attracted a pool of more than 100
applications from across the globe, including some from as far away as
Africa, Switzerland and India. The success of the FIS-sponsored
accelerator program also led the Venture Center in late October to
launch a first-of-its-kind community bank-focused cohort program, called
the ICBA ThinkTech Accelerator. Organizers said the new ThinkTech
Accelerator will pursue companies exploring next-generation lending,
artificial intelligence and machine learning, blockchain, payments,
advanced analytics and big data, regulatory compliance tools,
cybersecurity, authentication, and streamlining customer experience,
among others. On Jan. 9, that program selected 10 companies from a pool
of 180 applicants to receive an initial investment of $75,000 to
participate in the 12-week residence and mentoring process for companies
looking to partner with community banks. Those cohorts will be selected
by a committee made up of executives from the Independent Community
Bankers of America (ICBA), who will actively serve as mentors to
early-stage startups. GOVERNOR'S HANDStandridge said legislation
supported by Gov. Hutchinson to bolster the state's tech sector is the
impetus behind many of these ongoing accelerator programs. Three key
bills, sponsored by former State Sen. David Sanders, R-Little Rock, now
the head of Winrock International's Innovate Arkansas program that helps
startups and other technology ventures reach their potential, were
enacted into law during the 2017 regular session. Acts 166 and 167 of
2017 overhauled the Arkansas Acceleration Fund created by the
legislature in 2011 to help bring high-tech jobs to the state. Act 165
of 2017, created the 'Arkansas Business and Technology Accelerator Act.'
Under this proposal, AEDC's division of Science and Technology will
create a state-supported startup immersion program that will help local
companies and entrepreneurs quickly commercialize their business ideas
and concepts. 'It just has been 18 months since the governor really
funded the accelerator fund and it is unrealistic to see dividends in
the first year of operation,' said Standridge. 'But I think we are
really going to see the fruit of that decision began to be borne out in
2019 and certainly in 2020.' __________________ Editor's note: This

Addressing Rising Cases, High Cost of Treating Chronic Kidney Disease

The Guardian

March 12, 2018

Copyright 2018 AllAfrica Global Media All Rights Reserved

Length: 1880 words

Byline: Chukwuma Muanya

Body

Nigeria, on March 8, joined the rest of the world to celebrate the World
Kidney Day (WKD). A day set aside to raise awareness on the plight of
people living with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and how to better
prevent, treat and manage the "incurable condition." CHUKWUMA MUANYA
(Assistant Editor) and OLUWATOSIN AREO write.

Tina had finished writing her final degree exams. She took ill while
waiting for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) call up. Tina was
diagnosed of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). She started seeing doctors
(not nephrologists) and also "prayer specialists." But her condition was
not getting better.

By the time the family got direction to send her to India for a kidney
transplant, her condition had deteriorated. Tina had developed a lot of
complications. The family had to spend more time and money to get her on
dialysis and a kidney transplant. But she died six months after the
transplant.

However, Mr. Innocent Nnorom has a different story. 39 year- old
Innocent, married with two children, is a survivor of CKD. He had a
successful kidney transplant with a kidney from his younger brother
Chigbo, in 2012. Six years on, Innocent and Chigbo, who hail from Ihiala
in Ihiala Local Government Area (LGA) of Anambra State, are alive to
tell the story.

Tina and Innocent represent thousands of Nigerians with End Stage Kidney
Disease (ESKD) and about 54 million Nigerians that have kidney-related
diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.

Innocent told The Guardian yesterday: "CKD is not a terminal disease."

He enumerated some of the reasons why many victims die: "The common
person does not have sufficient information about kidney related
ailments. There are very few fully equipped hospitals to treat these
types of patients. Many people are not able to gather enough funds to
get the treatment done.

"Top of the reason why many die of CKD is lack of information. When you
or your relative are diagnosed of kidney disease take the right steps
and you will get the right treatment."

Nephrologists are unanimous that dialysis is the end of the road because
it is very expensive. They say, ideally, dialysis costs N90, 000 a week
and N360,000 monthly apart from medications that help control the blood
pressure. They insist that it is cheaper to prevent than treat because
if the person were not placed on dialysis, he or she would die.

Several studies indicate that 17,000 new cases of CKD are diagnosed
yearly and only 2000 can afford dialysis treatment in Nigeria.

Consultant Nephrologist and Transplant Physician at the Lagos University
Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Dr. Toyin Amira, told The Guardian: "One
session for dialysis cost between N20,000 to N30,000 and you can imagine
someone with kidney failure that needs to do that three times a week. It
is a continuous treatment until the individual gets the transplant and
even kidney transplant cost about N6.5 million and above, in some
centres N10 million. So the best way out is prevention.

"There is no cure to CKD and it is not reversible, what can be referred
as cure is transplant which is expensive, and better not to have it.

"Acute Kidney Disease (AKD) is someone who was well but because of
vomiting and diarrhoea leads to injury to the kidney and in most
situation, they recover. It is not a respecter of age but for us in
Nigeria it happens to people between 20 and 50 (the economically
productive age). In the young children, it is due to some abnormality of
the urinary tract as they grow older, other things like infection comes
in."

Ahead of the World Kidney Day (WKD), Amira told The Guardian: "There has
been an increase in the number of chronic kidney disease and this is due
to an increase in prevalence of hypertension and diabetes especially and
some other conditions such as Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV), which
have increased the burden of kidney disease in Nigeria."

The theme of this year's World Kidney Day -- kidneys and women's health
-- highlights an important but often neglected area of nephrology and,
more broadly, of global health.

What are the major causes of chronic kidney disease?

Amira said: "Yes, the common type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease. We
are adopting the Western lifestyle by eating a lot of food that is high
in fat, energy dense food or drink. Most people no longer exercise and
many are getting obese. Obesity predisposes one to hypertension and
diabetes, so diabetes is really on the high side in driving the increase
in kidney disease.

Use of herbal medication that we don't really know its constituents, the
manufacturing process not stringent, some contain toxins that are
harmful to the body. Abuse of analgesic also increases it.

So basically not eating right, obesity, use of herbal medications,
abuses of analgesic are some of the driving forces."

She added: "The use of bleaching creams has also been implicated in CKD
because it contains mercury, which damages the kidney."

Why the focus on women? Epidemiological studies suggest that
pre-dialysis CKD is more prevalent in women than in men, and women are
more likely than men to be kidney donors, but more men than women
receive dialysis or undergo kidney transplantation.

According to in a review published ahead of the WKD in the journal
Nature, the factors that contribute to these disparities are complex and
likely involve biological differences that affect the rate of CKD
progression and transplantation criteria (such as the presence of
preformed antibodies), as well as sociocultural influences that affect
access to care.

A second Review by Kate Wiles and colleagues found that reproductive
health and pregnancy are important issues for women with CKD. CKD is
associated with reduced fertility and an increased risk of adverse
pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery and fetal
growth restriction. Moreover, low birth weight is a risk factor for
hypertension and kidney disease in later life, perpetuating the cycle.

To Amira, the focus on women is because there are some diseases that are
peculiar to women and from experience some of the women who ended up
with kidney failure started with pregnancy.

The consultant nephrologist said there are some women that are not known
to be hypertensive but develop blood pressure doing the end time of
pregnancy (pre-eclampsia) and the blood pressure never returns to
normal.

She further explained: "Some problems women face have their root in
pregnancy, some develop gestational diabetes and after pregnancy transit
to be diabetic, maybe not well managed develop some kidney issues. Some
diabetes starts in pregnancy, some women have it and are not diagnosed
until pregnancy or they have it when they get pregnant, it flares up and
destroys the kidney. So this year looks at the diseases that are
peculiar to women and what predisposes them to having kidney disease.

"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is more common in women because of the
woman anatomy. Aside from UTIs, there are some pelvic tumour or
malignancies in women. We have some that have huge fibroid that sit on
the pipe that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder, which causes
obstruction and when discovered would have caused kidney damage.

"Some with cancer of the cervix and uterus, which sometimes spreads to
involve the kidney."

The nephrologist urged women to be aware of some of these peculiar
diseases especially in pregnancy. "Even after delivery there must be
regular follow up to ensure that things are okay. Some don't do it. Like
pre-eclampsia can cause acute kidney injury, we see many women referred
to LUTH who were not properly managed," she said.

Amira said women are sensitised that when they are pregnant, they should
go for proper antenatal and if any of these disease is discovered, they
should be referred to specialist and regular follow up after delivery.

She said pre-eclampsia is a type of hypertension that develops in the
later part of pregnancy, the woman develops high blood pressure, leg
swelling and spill protein in the urine and the blood pressure can go so
high that she convulse. "It is very serious and can harm the mother and
the baby and lead to foetal loss or maternal death."

The nephrologist, however, said with good and early antenatal care, "you
would see the trend coming, diagnosed early and nipped in the bud.
Gestational diabetes is in women who were not known to be diabetic but
blood sugar goes up during pregnancy. So they have high blood glucose
and if not well managed can lead to loss of the baby because such women
usually have very big babies. So women who have big babies should be
screened for gestational diabetes and such women later on develop type 2
diabetes."

On recommendations on how to survive ESKD/CKD, Innocent said: "Start
seeing a kidney disease specialist (nephrologist) immediately - time is
of essence. Adjust your diet and life style (your nephrologist will
guide you). Take your medicines as at when due. Attend clinics.

Report every change you notice in your body to your doctor for prompt
check up. If the family can afford kidney transplantation, start
planning for that immediately. It is better to do it when the patient is
still very strong. Avoid self medications (orthodox and herbal)."

Amira said kidney care at LUTH is very comprehensive. She explained: "We
have all it takes to look after patients with kidney disease. We have
dialysis machine, transplant facilities and we have done successfully
some in the past. We have well trained specialist who are capable of
taking care of this patients, we run two kidney clinics weekly so the
patients are sure to get good renal care in LUTH. We are well equipped.
We have functional and some new machines and offer dialysis to people.

"There is no free medical care in Nigeria. It is out of pocket money but
unfortunately, anywhere in the world, kidney care is expensive, but the
difference is that the government take absolute care of the treatment
and takes the burden off the patient by paying for dialysis and
transplant but unfortunately we don't have that arrangement here. It
makes it expensive."

The nephrologist said the WKD is to raise awareness because it is far
cheaper to avoid kidney dieses than to manage it. "It is expensive and
here that we pay out of our pocket, many cannot afford it while the
mortality is high. Prevention is key by adopting healthy lifestyle."

She said most Nigerians do not have a culture of routine medical check
up. Amira explained: "The doctor is not there for treating disease but
to help individuals maintain good health. Encourage the culture of
routine check up.

"It is so cheap with about N3000 you can run urine and blood test, and
no one would know whether your kidney are healthy or not. Those with
kidney failures must take their drugs and treatment is for life.

Innocent added: "When the patient has got kidney transplantation, he/she
can still live for as long as God wills. The major challenge is the cost
of the immune suppressants that the persons have to continue taking for
the rest of their lives. We therefore implore the government and
corporate bodies to come to our aid.

These medicines should be included in the National Health Insurance
Scheme (NHIS) scheme so these patients can always access them. Partner
with the hospitals treating these patients to subsidize their
treatments."

pre-dialysis CKD is more prevalent in women than in men, and women are
more likely than men to be kidney donors, but more men than women
receive dialysis or undergo kidney transplantation.

According to in a review published ahead of the WKD in the journal
Nature, the factors that contribute to these disparities are complex and
likely involve biological differences that affect the rate of CKD
progression and transplantation criteria (such as the presence of
preformed antibodies), as well as sociocultural influences that affect
access to care.

A second Review by Kate Wiles and colleagues found that reproductive
health and pregnancy are important issues for women with CKD. CKD is
associated with reduced fertility and an increased risk of adverse
pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery and fetal
growth restriction. Moreover, low birth weight is a risk factor for
hypertension and kidney disease in later life, perpetuating the cycle.

To Amira, the focus on women is because there are some diseases that are
peculiar to women and from experience some of the women who ended up
with kidney failure started with pregnancy.

The consultant nephrologist said there are some women that are not known
to be hypertensive but develop blood pressure doing the end time of
pregnancy (pre-eclampsia) and the blood pressure never returns to
normal.

She further explained: "Some problems women face have their root in
pregnancy, some develop gestational diabetes and after pregnancy transit
to be diabetic, maybe not well managed develop some kidney issues. Some
diabetes starts in pregnancy, some women have it and are not diagnosed
until pregnancy or they have it when they get pregnant, it flares up and
destroys the kidney. So this year looks at the diseases that are
peculiar to women and what predisposes them to having kidney disease.

"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is more common in women because of the
woman anatomy. Aside from UTIs, there are some pelvic tumour or
malignancies in women. We have some that have huge fibroid that sit on
the pipe that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder, which causes
obstruction and when discovered would have caused kidney damage.

"Some with cancer of the cervix and uterus, which sometimes spreads to
involve the kidney."

The nephrologist urged women to be aware of some of these peculiar
diseases especially in pregnancy. "Even after delivery there must be
regular follow up to ensure that things are okay. Some don't do it. Like
pre-eclampsia can cause acute kidney injury, we see many women referred
to LUTH who were not properly managed," she said.

Amira said women are sensitised that when they are pregnant, they should
go for proper antenatal and if any of these disease is discovered, they
should be referred to specialist and regular follow up after delivery.

She said pre-eclampsia is a type of hypertension that develops in the
later part of pregnancy, the woman develops high blood pressure, leg
swelling and spill protein in the urine and the blood pressure can go so
high that she convulse. "It is very serious and can harm the mother and
the baby and lead to foetal loss or maternal death."

The nephrologist, however, said with good and early antenatal care, "you
would see the trend coming, diagnosed early and nipped in the bud.
Gestational diabetes is in women who were not known to be diabetic but
blood sugar goes up during pregnancy. So they have high blood glucose
and if not well managed can lead to loss of the baby because such women
usually have very big babies. So women who have big babies should be
screened for gestational diabetes and such women later on develop type 2
diabetes."

On recommendations on how to survive ESKD/CKD, Innocent said: "Start
seeing a kidney disease specialist (nephrologist) immediately - time is
of essence. Adjust your diet and life style (your nephrologist will
guide you). Take your medicines as at when due. Attend clinics.

Report every change you notice in your body to your doctor for prompt
check up. If the family can afford kidney transplantation, start
planning for that immediately. It is better to do it when the patient is
still very strong. Avoid self medications (orthodox and herbal)."

Amira said kidney care at LUTH is very comprehensive. She explained: "We
have all it takes to look after patients with kidney disease. We have
dialysis machine, transplant facilities and we have done successfully
some in the past. We have well trained specialist who are capable of
taking care of this patients, we run two kidney clinics weekly so the
patients are sure to get good renal care in LUTH. We are well equipped.
We have functional and some new machines and offer dialysis to people.

"There is no free medical care in Nigeria. It is out of pocket money but
unfortunately, anywhere in the world, kidney care is expensive, but the
difference is that the government take absolute care of the treatment
and takes the burden off the patient by paying for dialysis and
transplant but unfortunately we don't have that arrangement here. It
makes it expensive."

The nephrologist said the WKD is to raise awareness because it is far
cheaper to avoid kidney dieses than to manage it. "It is expensive and
here that we pay out of our pocket, many cannot afford it while the
mortality is high. Prevention is key by adopting healthy lifestyle."

She said most Nigerians do not have a culture of routine medical check
up. Amira explained: "The doctor is not there for treating disease but
to help individuals maintain good health. Encourage the culture of
routine check up.

"It is so cheap with about N3000 you can run urine and blood test, and
no one would know whether your kidney are healthy or not. Those with
kidney failures must take their drugs and treatment is for life.

Innocent added: "When the patient has got kidney transplantation, he/she
can still live for as long as God wills. The major challenge is the cost
of the immune suppressants that the persons have to continue taking for
the rest of their lives. We therefore implore the government and
corporate bodies to come to our aid.

These medicines should be included in the National Health Insurance
Scheme (NHIS) scheme so these patients can always access them. Partner
with the hospitals treating these patients to subsidize their
treatments."

Brex brings on $150M in new cash in case of an 'extended recession'

May 27 -- Fast-growing fintech behemoth Brex is raising big money as its
customer base itself - high-growth and spendy startups - is struggling.

The company, which sells a credit card tailored for startups, today
announced that it has raised $150 million in a Series C extension from a
group of existing investors, including DST Global and Lone Pine Capital.

With the new raise, Brex, which was co-founded by Henrique Dubugras and
Pedro Franceschi, has now amassed $465 million in venture capital
funding to-date.

Brex plans to use its new capital to invest across engineering, product,
and design functions to improve its customer experience. It also plans
to make small acquisitions to help with hiring and product goals. In
late March, the startup announced that it had acquired three companies,
Neji, Compose Labs and Landria, for an undisclosed amount.

Layoffs are impacting a number of businesses, and where upstart
companies aren't cutting staff, they are often reducing spend. That's
not good news for Brex, which makes money on purchases made through its
corporate card.

Brex has already cut some customer credit limits to mitigate some of the
exposure risk, The Information reported and Dubugras confirmed. Brex,
once known for its flashy billboards, has lessened its spend on travel
and restaurants to "almost zero" since COVID-19 started.

However, Dubugras seems largely unbothered on how the pandemic impacts
Brex's future. The new fundraise was opportunistic, and he noted how
Stripe and Robinhood recently raised as well.

"I'm glad this round came together, but if it hadn't, we would've been
fine," he said. "The capital is so we can play offensive while everyone
else plays defensive."

Its clients have always had a high risk for failure, since they are
startups after all, so Brex built a model that accounts for this. "Us
lowering credit limits has been happening since the existence of Brex,"
Dubugras said. "It's not something that is new to COVID."

The new capital, according to Dubugras, is all "general purpose cash"
and will go directly to the company's balance sheet, which now has $450
million. The round was closed a few days ago.

Brex's rise has largely come during an upmarket. The startup, which
launched in Brazil, has long enjoyed time in the spotlight as a Silicon
Valley success story. A New York Times headline about the startup
captured its allure well: "bad times in tech? Not if you're a startup
serving other startups."

 

Today's financing news, while it is an extension of a preexisting Series
C round, is Brex's largest single raise to date. The Y Combinator
graduate last raised venture capital money in June 2019, in a $100
million round from Kleiner Perkins valuing the company at $2.6 billion.

In the past, each successive Brex raise came along with a flagship
product update. Months after its Series C in October, the company
launched its second product: a credit card for ecommerce companies In
just a few months time, the new product "multiplied Brex's TAM and
became responsible for one-third of the business's revenue." After its
June 2019 raise, Brex launched a credit card for life sciences
companies, and then a few months later, it announced Brex Cash, a
product that acts like a checking account replacement for startups.

 

In 2020, however, its strategy appears more conservative. Dubugras
compared Brex's business similar to venture capital, in that they get
the most value for themselves, and shareholders, with customers that
stay and grow with the company for a longer time.

"Going to any new verticals or any kind of growth projects are not
necessarily priorities for the year," he said. "Most of the funds will
go toward building the product; the investment in growth is probably
done post COVID-19.

It's up to the company, which has grown comfortably on the shoulders of
an upmarket up until this point, to prove that it can retain its
venture-ready growth profile. "I'm optimistic about tech, so I'm
optimistic about Brex," Dubugras said.

18 months and counting - pandemic resilience insights from authors at
the Bangalore Business LitFest 2021

Speakers at the Bangalore Business Literature Festival share insights on
the mindset, approaches, and tactics of resilience during the ongoing
pandemic.

The seventh annual Bangalore Business Literature Festival (BBLF) will be
held entirely online this year, due to the coronavirus pandemic. As
festival media partner, see YourStory's coverage of the editions in
2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015.

See also YourStory's Book Review section with reviews of over 320
titles, and our compilation of 85 Quotes on World Book Day.

BBLF 2021 will be held on September 21-23. Our earlier preview articles
addressed startup advice and failure recovery. With the pandemic crisis
raging for over 18 months in India, authors discuss eight aspects of
resilience - from business shifts and digital transformation to cultural
affirmation and crisis preparedness.

1. Crisis preparedness

"The best examples of business resilience have occurred in companies
that had 'vaccinated' their enterprise with a vaccine called people
power, or engagement along with culture and positivity," explains R
Gopalakrishnan, author of over 15 books on management, including A
Biography of Innovations and Wisdom For Startups From Grown-ups.

"I call this vaccine PP-365 because it is the best vaccine to create
long-life, sustainable enterprises," he succinctly sums up.

A report by Deloitte Global reveals that companies with built-in
resilience were better equipped to handle the crisis, according to Dr
Karthik Nagendra, CEO of ThoughtStarters and author of The Thought
Leader Way: Leading Your Business with Thought Leadership in an Altered
World.

"I think companies that succeeded during the pandemic had some aspects
in common. They already had invested in workforce initiatives like
reskilling their employees or redesigning work," he observes.

"They had diversified operations and developed technological
capabilities to drive new business models. They had adapted to remote
working, kept employees safe, and maintained trust between leaders and
employees," Karthik adds.

Such organisations valued diversity, equity, and inclusion and were
committed to improving the environment and strengthening communities.
"Thought leadership that focuses on research, collaboration between all
stakeholders, and revolves on customer success will make a high impact
in the present era," Karthik advises.

2. A return to traditional strengths

"The pandemic has impacted people all over the world. The way people
live and work has changed, perhaps irreversibly," observes Kaninika
Mishra, author of The Indic Quotient: Reclaiming Heritage Through
Cultural Enterprise.

"In India, the uncertainties and vulnerabilities caused by the pandemic
saw people turn to familiar traditions to brace themselves physically
and mentally," she adds. Demand for turmeric as well as online yoga and
meditation classes reportedly increased.

Kaninika notes that many small ventures showed more resilience and used
imaginative ways to keep their business going than large organisations.

"I have seen yoga entrepreneurs with a 100 percent physical teaching
model pivot to an online mode overnight," she recalls. Another venture
engaged in handloom products began producing masks within a week as the
sale of non-essential products dropped to zero.

3. Business transformation

"I have seen founders truly innovate and think out of the box, in the
darkest of times. Resilience has been tested on the financial,
technological, operational, and organisational fronts," recalls Bhavna
Dalal, Founder and CEO of Talent Power Partners, and author of Checkmate
Office Politics.

Many quickly modified and transformed their business models. "It has
been a survival of the fittest and the bravest. Of course, there was
disappointment earlier but people recovered from it quickly and kept
going," she adds, citing as an example the founders of a coworking space
who converted their offices into quarantine facilities.

4. Work from home

"Businesses, which used to insist on six-day week working have learnt
the benefits of allowing people to work more flexibly, from homes. This
is a significant shift in the mindset, which is poised to change the
very labour market," says V Raghunathan, BBLF Chair and author of
bestsellers such as Games Indians Play and Ganesha on the Dashboard.

"The emerging model, in some ways, has been more women-friendly. It is
more planet-friendly leading to lesser fuel emissions, and more labour
market-friendly in creating newer labour markets especially in the food
and grocery delivery markets," he adds.

There have also been breakthroughs in the use of technology for
delivering online education, and notable developments in healthcare. "Of
course, many of these come with their flip side, especially when you
consider the problems of children being out of schools for nearly two
years, or technical education without laboratory work," Raghunathan
cautions.

5. Brand power

Shifts in business and marketing practices are cited by Jessie Paul, CEO
of B2B consulting firm, Paul Writer and author of No-Money Marketing:
From Upstart to Big Brand on a Frugal Budget.

For example, Bajaj Consumer Care launched a whole new product category -
hand sanitiser - in the midst of the lockdown, as that was the market
need. "They also ramped up their digital presence across product lines
as the 'place of purchase' had changed," she explains.

Some brands had to change their delivery models from in-person to
remote. "Those that had already embarked on digital transformation were
poised for success," Jesse adds.

"In some product categories where the rules restricted business,
resilience was in staying in the minds of consumers, managing the
employee branding to the extent possible, and finding unaffected niches
to keep revenues flowing," she observes.

She advises businesses to carefully understand whether their customer
has changed due to the ongoing crisis. Frameworks such as the '4 Ps'
(product, price, place, promotion) can help lay out the scenario.

wellness space with the Eka app

6. Digital transformation

"Each and every company out there which has survived was smart enough to
adapt. Many firms embraced D2C, online deliveries, and even WFH,"
explains Suresh Narasimha, tech entrepreneur, Co-founder at CoCreate
Ventures, and owner of JustBooks.

"I am specifically proud of how one of our companies Cultureplace
adapted to the pandemic and started delivering curated learning
experiences," he adds. Instead of only cultural events in physical
spaces, it also offers online storytelling, workshops, and interactive
sessions on music, math, and science.

"The pandemic was a boon to digital-first brands that were ready to grab
the opportunity whether it was coffee or entertainment," Jesse Paul
affirms.

Now digital transformation is the buzzword. "But it will not be
sufficient to give a competitive edge, only ensure survival. Brands
playing catch-up need to look beyond digital transformation delivering
operational efficiency, to delivering access to whole new market
segments," she emphasises.

7. Media shifts

Some publishers pivoted smartly during the pandemic, according to Rishad
Tobaccowala, Senior Advisor to the Publicis Groupe and author of
Restoring the Soul of Business: Staying Human in the Age of Data.

"My publisher HarperCollins quickly pivoted to using Glose to distribute
the book globally and virtually. Their virtual events were another form
of resilience," he explains. "My book seems to have anticipated key
challenges and opportunities we face, making people think I wrote it
post-COVID when it was actually written in 2019," he adds.

8. The festival industry

Pandemic challenges have affected book fairs and cultural festivals as
well. BBLF had to switch to an online format for the first time in 2020,
and will be virtual this year as well.

"Since there is fatigue today about virtual events, the challenge is how
to get people interested in an online business literature festival. So
we picked topics that are current, hot, and edgy," explains Benedict
Paramanand, Co-founder of BBLF.

He cites workplace transformation and the rise of literature tech
platforms as other examples of resilience and growth. Other topics to be
discussed at the three-day festival next week include Indian business
writing, political shifts, and the future of Indian science.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the energy conundrum

While Bitcoin and Ethereum consume more energy annually than some
developed nations, it is a monumental challenge to precisely determine
the energy mix powering the distributed set of nodes participating in
these networks.

An estimate by The University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative
Finance (CCAF) has projected Bitcoin's total energy consumption was
around 130-terawatt hours annually.

Ethereum - the most popular blockchain network for Decentralised App
(DApp) development - has also been running a highly energy-intensive
global platform. An Investopedia article in late 2021 pointed out that
the Ethereum network uses 99.6 terawatt-hours of electricity each year.

The topic of energy use by cryptocurrency has seen polarised reactions.
On one hand, some who believe Bitcoin (and other crypto-assets like
Ethereum) are scams or channels for money laundering, usually maintain
that their energy consumption is unnecessary and far too wasteful.

On the other hand, those in favour of these currencies as decentralised
platforms for storing their wealth think the energy spend is required.

The Decrypting Story takes a closer look at these arguments. Read more.

Proteas' mountain to climb

Hindustan Times Lucknow

September 12, 2019 Thursday

Copyright 2019 HT Digital streams Ltd All Rights Reserved

Length: 831 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Sept. 12 -- January 2018. South Africa's then head coach,
Ottis Gibson, launched a grand 'Vision 2019', a master plan to break the
Proteas' choking streak at the World Cup.

August 2019. Gibson and his entire coaching team got the boot by Cricket
South Africa (CSA). Only three wins in nine matches in England had left
the 'vision' somewhat blurred.

Gibson's blueprint for succeeding involved experimentation and rotation,
all leading up to the big prize. It never came. Retirements, tightly
packed bilateral ODI series leading to fatigue and an injury-list that
kept getting longer right into the World Cup meant that the Proteas
finished seventh-only above Bangladesh, West Indies and Afghanistan. "We
only had 18 months, probably less than 18 months to build a team, so
time was always against us," Gibson would go on to say after the exit.

In less than 18 months, South Africa will go into another ICC event -
the World T20 in Australia, a tournament where they have reached the
semi-finals on two occasions. Shaking away the disappointment of the
bygone World Cup campaign and rebuilding in time for the World T20 is
their big challenge. The journey won't be easy but it offers redemption
too.

The first step on the long road to the World T20 will be taken on Sunday
in Dharamsala, where the three-match T20 series against India begins.
This is South Africa's first assignment post the World Cup meltdown and,
understandably, the squad bears a fresh look.

The last time South Africa toured this part of the world for a T20
series in 2015-16, they prevailed 2-0. Only fast bowler Kagiso Rabada
remains from that squad for the upcoming series. According to SA's
interim team-director Enoch Nkwe, South Africa have already begun wiping
the slate, starting with Quinton de Kock replacing the experienced Faf
du Plessis as captain in T20Is. "It's also an opportunity to start
building for the future. We know where Faf stands, as a captain and as a
player. He's done great things for South African cricket. We also need
to look at what the future looks like. We believe in Quinton, who's
going to be leading the team in this series," Nkwe, the
coach-cum-manager, said during his first press meet in Dharamsala.

"The T20 series gives us the last chance to have a look at our
leadership and batting options as the next edition of the T20 World Cup
is now little more than a year away, which is why we have gone with an
inexperienced leadership group," Corrie van Zyl, CSA's acting director
of cricket, had said before the team's departure.

For de Kock, who came into the limelight with three successive ODI tons
against India at home in 2013, his promotion to the captain's post is a
gradual progression of a player who was primed to be major force in the
South African line-up. At the World Cup, he was one of the three South
African batsmen, along with du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen, to
tally more than 300 runs and yet it was his failure to convert his
starts into big scores that ended up hurting South Africa.

"Coming into this series, we've got a lot of new players. Win or lose, I
just want the guys to keep competing, keep fighting. As long as they
keep doing that, I'm sure we'll be in good hands," said de Kock. "We've
got quite a young team, so there will be a lot of energy. I'm looking
forward to that." Of course he is, given he struck two centuries and 318
runs the last time South Africa played an ODI series in India, back in
2015-16.

Not everyone who failed in England and Wales has been ignored. The South
Africans have included eight players from the World Cup squad in the
14-man T20 unit for the India tour. Seven of those eight are returning
from a period away from cricket, while only Beuran Hendricks featured in
an A-series. Aiden Markram and Lungi Ngidi, both of whom starred in the
Test series when India toured South Africa in 2018, will feature in the
long-format leg of this tour, starting in Visakhapatnam early next
month.

The squad features four T20 debutants in batsman Temba Bavuma, left-arm
spinner Bjorn Fortuin, allrounder George Linde and fast bowler Anrich
Nortje. All four were part of the South Africa A side that played in the
recently-concluded one-day series against India A. Three other members
from that A side are in the T20 side.

And it is not only the T20s that will see players earning international
caps. The Test squad has a possible debutant in Nortje, wicketkeeper
Rudi Second and spinning allrounder Senuran Muthusamy. "We're looking to
invest in a good foundation going into the T20 World Cup next year in
Australia. But we still have a lot of games. We have about 20 games. So
we'll reassess the situation after these three games against India and
see where we're at. For now, the focus is this upcoming series," Nkwe
said.

14-man T20 unit for the India tour. Seven of those eight are returning
from a period away from cricket, while only Beuran Hendricks featured in
an A-series. Aiden Markram and Lungi Ngidi, both of whom starred in the
Test series when India toured South Africa in 2018, will feature in the
long-format leg of this tour, starting in Visakhapatnam early next
month.

The squad features four T20 debutants in batsman Temba Bavuma, left-arm
spinner Bjorn Fortuin, allrounder George Linde and fast bowler Anrich
Nortje. All four were part of the South Africa A side that played in the
recently-concluded one-day series against India A. Three other members
from that A side are in the T20 side.

And it is not only the T20s that will see players earning international
caps. The Test squad has a possible debutant in Nortje, wicketkeeper
Rudi Second and spinning allrounder Senuran Muthusamy. "We're looking to
invest in a good foundation going into the T20 World Cup next year in
Australia. But we still have a lot of games. We have about 20 games. So
we'll reassess the situation after these three games against India and
see where we're at. For now, the focus is this upcoming series," Nkwe
said.

Tremendous potential in Medical tourism business

If you are looking to set up a unique startup, the following facts and
figures will help you create a vision about the tremendous business
potential in this sector.

* Post-pandemic, the pent-up demand for beyond the border healthcare
services is unimaginable.38% of global cancer surgeries got cancelled.

* Millions of patients are waiting for surgeries since the last 2 years,
and clearing this massive backlog cannot happen overnight.

* Patient waiting times are likely to worsen in some countries.

* Not only dental treatments and cosmetic surgeries, a Bloomberg report
says, startups expect treatments in critical illness to account for 80%
of medical tourism business in the next few years.

* In 2016, nearly 14 million people spent $68 billion on medical tourism
reports PwC.

* Foreign patients nearly spend $6000 per trip accounting for a
cumulative spending of up to $72 billion.

* Medical tourists are likely to opt for more wellness activities in
selected destinations as a part of their recovery program.

Last but not the least, complexities in medical tourism have multiplied
than one can think of. And here lies opportunities for medical tourism
business startups.

Medical tourism is something more than treatment and tourism

The entirejourney of medical touristsis not only about getting the
treatment done and healing but also a lot more. They also look for full
mind-body rejuvenation so that they can lead quality life when back
home. Their journey covers a long chain of touchpoints which if not
taken careof create painful experience for patients. There has been a
persistent gap in quality service offerings which just got widened after
the pandemic. There is a dire need to fill this gap with right
solutions.

Redundant medical tourism business models don't work

Countless medical tourism companies perished due to the pandemic-induced
travel restrictions. And the old model of business is not going to work
anymore because the problems are no longer the same as before.Patients'
demands are also witnessing a rapid shift. This is the opportune moment
to set up medical tourism startups. Prospective medical tourists are
left with few choices who would help them go through the journey
seamlessly.

Patients demand delightful experiences not mere satisfactory experiences

Expert medical tourism consultants, advisors, and marketers are
equivocal in this regard. As the patient's demand graph shoots up,
innovative startups tapping these intangible factors in patient
experience are sure winners.

Patient's painpoints are more than you can think of

More the complexities more are the painpoints and greater will be the
demand for great solutions. Travel restrictions, rising airfares,
threats of infection, global inflation, war and conflicts are making
things more difficult. While we talk of innovation and uniqueness in
medical tourism startups, offering great solutions to patients'
painpoints is the best way for acquisition and retention. You gradually
build a loyal customer base that adds to yourbusiness sustainability.

Medical wellness experience- the new normal experience

Medical tourists now seek holistic experiences that cover consultation,
treatment, hospital stay, recovery, andmind-relaxing rejuvenating
exercises. It may not be always shopping and site seeing but regaining
well-being in a meaningful way to stave off diseases or manage chronic
conditions better.

Medical tourists will opt for long stay for healing

Cure and healing have taken different dimensions. While the pre-pandemic
scenario was just to get the treatment done and fly back home, post
pandemic scenario is quite different. Patients are more interested in
holistic healing to wipe away the last bit of stress, strain, and
anxiety of pre-treatment suffering. They are more eager for quality long
stay recuperative process and willing to pay a premium for the
associated services and products.

Medical Tourism Startups are getting investors' attention

Despite all the pall and gloom in the medical tourism market due to
covid, medical tourism and wellness tourism startups are bagging great
fundings from institutional investors. This is largely an untapped
market, and the emerging factors do create a positive outlook.

Global population has accepted to live with the virus. And how long can
patients postpone their healthcare needs? The urgency that is brewing is
yet to come to surface with full throttle. Institutional investors are
keeping an eye on recent happenings in medical tourism and wellness
tourism market, and will be eager to put their money for some bigger
returns.

Why do you need funding?

Whether you self-fund your medical tourism and wellness tourism business
or take help from family and friends, your funding needs will be more as
you cruise along.

Top reasons are likely:

* Launch your business if your self-financing efforts fall short to
achieve the critical amount.

* Expand and diversify your business by hiring, introducing new
technology or launching new products and services.

* Make yourself visible to a larger market segment.

* Most importantly, prove legitimacy and add credibility to your
business.

How much investment do you need?

It depends upon your proposed business model and mode of operations. The
initial investment can be anything between $1000-$5000. To open a
medical tourism agency, the recommended startup investment could be
around $27000, which is quite feasible given the expected higher ROI.
Another great thing about medical tourism and wellness tourism business
is that you can launch it from your home. Therefore, you may not need an
astronomically high funding amount to set up a swanky office or hire a
big workforce.

Before thinking of getting funding for your medical tourism and wellness
tourism business, you need to have a clear vision about what role you
are going to play in the market? What value you will add to customers?
You have a plethora of options to explore.

Again, the investment will depend upon what you plan to offer and other
aspects related to business operations. As your startup gets
operational, you will need wellness tourism and medical tourism
consultants to plan your funding through potential investors for further
diversification and brand building.

Best funding options for your medical tourism business

Your business needs credible legal structure

The nature of the business entity is as important as business model and
strategy. As a startup, you will tend to go for a minimum expensive
frame that is simple and easy to implement. Legal complications is the
last thing that investors would like to see. A legal entity will also
shield you from unlimited liability. Typically, one should opt for LLC
(Limited Liability Company) instead of C Corporation to prevent higher
tax cuts.

The plan for funding in medical tourism business startups

Most entrepreneurs bootstrap their startups either through personal
savings or taking loans from family and friends. Such strategies are
good to kickstart your medical tourism startup but you will need more
funding to make your business sustainable in the long run.

Let us look through the different stages of funding

Seed funding

This seed funding gives scope for your business to germinate. Your
personal savings and contributions from family members and friends
contribute to this seed funding. Crowdfunds and Angel Investors can also
contribute to this.

Series Round

This is the next stage that starts with A and stretches to B,C, and
onwards. Here you get into the real funding for your medical tourism
business. Money flows from institutional investors like Venture Capital
Fund Suppliers. As you move up the round, you get more capital and the
real business growth happens. More you get funding in successive rounds,
more your entrepreneurial capabilities get established.

When investors get serious in funding your business, the startup
valuation increases gradually. Although there is no fixed rule or
formula * regarding the investment amount, but it could be like the
following:

* Round A - Between $1-3 million

* Round B - Between $3-10 million

* Round C - Between $10-30 million

* Round D- Between 30-100 million

However, as a medical tourism startup, you need to understand the fine
demarcations between successive rounds. Better you understand that
firmer will be your grasp over investor-attracting factors and faster
will be your growth. Remember, A, B, and C are just the preliminary
stages of your business that will propel its further growth.

Venture Capital Funding

Venture capitalists will take interest in your medical tourism startup
if you have managed to build a decent client base. Because, it improves
your profitability and a healthy balance sheet. They step in when you
look for expansion, hiring staff, and infusion of working capital to
push the business growth. They look for equity as a prerogative to
safeguard their investments. They can also seek common equity so they
can have a say in operations or convertible debenture securities. They
are seasoned business persons with reasonable knowledge and ideas about
medical tourism business models.

Venture Capitalists also help in strategic planning and their
investments are most likely to improve the bottom line. Their funding
span covers around six years on average. You will find many established
venture capital firms specializing in medical tourism business funding.
Try to grow a network with them as it may take time to convince them
about your startup's potential.Venture Capitalists in their look out for
profit may coerce you to reframe your existing policies. You might have
to give up some stake in your business ownership. They keep their
targets high achieving which can be quite a daunting task.

Angel Investors

These investors are super rich and are more willing to take risks in
startup businesses. You should leave no stone unturned to draw their
attention. Angel investors also bring a wealth of experiencethat could
benefit your business as well. What you need is a team of Angel
Investors with large fund pools. They can be easily located and have the
potential to bring in more investments.

They are more interested to know about their potential return on
investment than how well your run your medical tourism startup business.
Naturally, convincing them is not easier either. However, you need to
docareful research about the ownership stake of Angel Investors. If you
have a great business plan and delivery, getting funding from Angel
investors will not be an uphill task.However, Angel Investors can be
very intrusive and get involved in vital aspects of your business. They
might as well look for personal opportunities in your business.
Encountering these could be a challenge, you need a special mindset to
cope with these situations.

Equity Funding

This is a type of funding where people willingly invest by buying a
certain fraction of ownership rights by equity. The major benefit is
that you need not have to repay the loan but pay the dividend as on
mutually agreed basis. The equity holders' knowledge and experience can
benefit your medical tourism startup. The challenges likely are you may
have to give off some of your control and allow them in crucial
decision-making processes.

Investment Banking and Smergers

If you are keen to enter into a venture with leading hospitals and
medical service providers can seek funding from this platform. You will
get expert guidance from financial experts to enable you run your
business from the early growth stage. This is a vast platform where your
queries about seeking funding will be open to public. Investors
interested in medical tourism startups will find you easily. You will
have to provide the necessary details about the location and nature of
your business with viable projections and estimations for investors to
get convinced.

Financial tie ups

There are patient financial engagement companies with robust knowledge
in healthcare business. They have close collaboration with hospitals and
healthcare centers and offer flexible payment schemes for patients.If
they find you are doing a great job in patient experience and
satisfaction, they might be ready to fund your medical tourism business.
They can foresee a great service for their potential customers which
ensures brand loyalty. Tie-ups with insurance companies can also be a
potential source of funding for your medical tourism startup.

Government Initiatives

Medical tourism has been in top of Covid-19 hit list. As the fear wanes,
medical tourism is picking up slowly. You can look for government
initiatives in lending financial support. With government backing comes
more credibility, a win-win situation for both.

Leading medical tourism destinations are mulling proposals to revive
this sector in the form of loans or tax incentives. Such loans will help
in paying off past debts and liabilities and give a fresh start to the
medical tourism business.

Besides, the government has announced to offer working capital loans to
medical tourism businesses. The funds obtained will be used to pay off
old liabilities or restart businesses in the healthcare industry.
Especially those that had been crippled by the coronavirus impact the
emphasis is on utilization of fresh loans to further the strength of
this sector to benefit the customers.

Tips to get quick funding for your medical tourism startup

Although funding from VCs in startups touched new highs, they take a
very cautious approach while investing in new startups. Here we share a
few valuable tips to get quick funding for your medical tourism and
wellness tourism strartup.

Do Reverse Engineering in Investment

Did you know that startups bagged $156 billion investment in 2020 up by
$56 billion from the previous year?

What is the business potential of the industry? Check the salient points
listed above. What are your offerings and who are the potential takers?
Work backward to understand your sales potential that will justify your
investment and investor's needs.

Plan investment and funding Expenses stepwise

90% of businesses fail due to a weak business model and faulty expense
planning.

Your chances of securing investment rest on some key pillars. Work on
your business concept and philosophy. Apart from profiteering, Medical
tourism and Wellness tourism businesses should display the humanitarian
purpose. Build your philosophy on that.

Many institutional investors get attracted towards humanitarian and
community upliftment purpose. Capital is flowing in businesses that help
to improve people's daily lives. Do a feasibility analysis. Be mindful
of product and service development. Get your financial projections
right.

Create a strong and crisp business plan

A study shows entrepreneurs with a written formal business plan get more
formal financial assistance than those without a plan. 70% VCs perceive
a written business plan very important.

No great idea should be in your head but put down on a paper. Investors
will see what is in front of them not what is hidden in your brain.
Convincing medical tourism and wellness tourism business cannot be done
verbally. You need to document those.

Is your startup worth the investors' risk? Why the investor will put
money in your business? A strong business plan will bear the testimony
to it. What are your objectives? How will you serve the medical tourism
and wellness tourism market? Most importantly, what difference you are
going to make in the existing scenario? All of these should be clearly
defined in the business plan.

Your plan should also talk about in details:

* Complete description of your offerings

* Your deep understanding of the target market and business viability

* Competitive analysis

* Financial projections

* Growth forecast model

* Elaborate marketing plan

* Pricing and promotional strategies

* Barriers to entry in the market

Understand the technicality of Investment

Global funding grew by $8 Billion in 2021

The scenario is encouraging but that does not give you the reason to put
lesser efforts. You need to have a deep understanding of the investors
and the different mechanisms that go into the startup investment
ecosystem. Get educated about angel investors, seed funding, venture
capital, and equity investments.How they work and what is required from
you to get the funding from them. Devote enough time to study all these
factors. Enrolling in medical tourism masterclasses or startup training
courses will help.

How unique is your medical tourism startup?

Did you know that 90% of startups fail and 34% of startups fail to do so
due to a lack of product-fit market?

This means, either your offering is inadequate or the market does not
exist. You need to envisage the best of ideas that will help in solving
some real problems of medical tourists and wellness enthusiasts. The
best ideas can only develop if you have a deep study of the market and
the customers' needs and wants. Higher their demands better are your
chances to get new ideas.

Did you know90% of unique business ideas fail in the first five years?
You need to ensure everything is right in your business model, business
plan, financial projections, marketing plans, hiring, etc.

Show networking and partnership

Small companies with Content Marketing and social media generate 67%
more leads

What people say about you impacts your chances of getting business
funding. Build your followers and customers on social media platforms
like Facebook and Instagram. Collect video reviews along with text
reviews to add credibility about your offerings. Social media platforms
create the opportunity to reach out to bigger audience. Use Linkedin to
build your professional credibility, partnerships and connect with
potential investors. Flaunt these while pitching for funding.

Practice minimalism - Focus on a lean model

66% of startups face financial challenges with 43% claiming meeting
operating expenses as thebiggest challenge.

Medical tourism and wellness tourism cover a lot of touch points, and
creating a great business model needs adequate brainstorming. A lean,
efficient, smart, and scalable business model will easily catch the
investors' attention who will feel secured about much lesser chances of
unwanted expenses. Flawed business model with too much redundant
activities is one of the critical factors of startup failure. When you
aim at lean model, you automatically take care of optimal resource
utilization that supports your sustainability and scalability.

Tap the investors' mindset

A recent survey says,more than 78% of small businesses reported profits.

Your investor should be able to relate well with your idea, else the
entire project may not go well. You may miss the desired profit. To
select the right investor for your medical tourism and wellness tourism
startup, you need to tap the investor's mind.

Medical tourism and wellness tourism business brings in lots of
intangible benefits which make many investors take interest in such
ventures. Many medical tourism businesses have been founded on the basis
of strong emotional factors from real life experiences.

The investor's reputation is important but you need the following as
well:

* How well the investor can be an influencer?

* What are their special interests or what is drawing them to your
business?

* Do they strongly believe in your ideas?

* Do they have any additional pleasure points in investing in this kind
of business?

* Will they give you enough room to execute your plans?

Join incubator programs

Business incubators can help in reducing the launching and operating
cost of a startup by 40-50%

Your medical tourism and wellness tourism startup can go haywire if
there are certain loopholes in the business model especially during the
early stages. These businesses have lots of complexities which could
pose serious obstacles for new entrants. Incubator programs are
tremendously helpful in providing guidance, mentorship, and build your
business networking. Do a background check of the mentors and
professionals on board and their success storiesThis will not only
streamline your operating expenses but also help in finding the right
investor for you.

Think of a strategic investor

Strategic investors have an increasing share in startup investments and
can boost 60% revenues

Strategic investors mean you have readily available capital. While VCs
take a more cautious approach to funding, investments from strategic
investors in early stage startups have shot up tremendously. Though
these investments come with a few strings attached, their knowledge,
outreach, and resources can propel your business growth. But be well
informed of their interests and settle for a win-win situation.

Participate in meetings and conferences

57% agree that networking events help you get the right investor

Investors in medical tourism and wellness tourism business are not
omnipresent. You need to really hunt for them at times. Global Medical
Tourism and Wellness Tourism conferences are held round the year in
different countries. In some countries, these are regular annual events.
Participating in these events means you land on a big platform where you
get rare opportunities to meet potential investors and providers.Do your
homework properly to make yourself presentable in the international
platform.

Your pitch deck should leave an impression

Even 10 slides are enough for an impressive pitch deck for new entrants
to get the right investment

All your great ideas and potential of medical tourism and wellness
tourism business could go down the drain if your pitch deck is bland and
shoddy. Too long presentation with overwhelming information can put off
your potential investors. New entrants are more likely to get into these
erroneous steps. It is hard for them to decide which information to keep
and which to discard.Keep your presentation short and crisp. Your
business propositions and related information should be presented in a
neat flow. Your investors will be impressed and appreciate you for
valuing their time.

Hire a recognized consultant

Running out of cash is the second most common cause of startup failure
around 29%

Great ideas do not always fetch good funding. Lack of insights, and
exposure pose big problems for getting funding. These are common
happenings when your business is in full operation but you need
additional funds to make it grow more. This is one of the reasons that
many startups shut down after 3-5 years in the market. A recognized
consultant will never allow your cash flow to dry up but help you get
timely funding.

There are several alternate means to get funding but to make things
faster and smooth, you need to follow the above tips.

Startup ecosystem report card: 44 unicorns with $106 billion value in 10
years; this many jobs created; The average time taken by startups to hit
the $1-billion valuation mark stood at 8 years. However, this is
declining.

India's tech startup ecosystem is approximately 15-year-old with the
likes of JustDial and Naukri.com among its early lot of internet
enterprises. It took around another 15 years for the country to get its
first unicorn - MakeMyTrip in 2010. Since then, the ecosystem has
churned out 44 such one-horned digital entities that have cumulatively
created around $106 billion value so far and over 1.4 million direct and
indirect employment annually, according to venture capital fund Orios
Venture Partners. Among prominent early-stage VCs, Orios was associated
with startups including Ola, Druva, Zostel, Pretty Secrets, PharmEasy,
and more.

InMobi, Flipkart, Ola, Paytm, Byju's, OYO, Swiggy, Zomato, PhonePe,
Lenskart, and more had added to the unicorn list over the past decade
including the recent ones such as Unacademy, Glance, Nykaa, Zerodha,
FirstCry, etc. The ecosystem has already gone through cycles of boom,
bust, and funding winter in the last 10 years fueled by valuation
bubble, investors' optimism because of fear-of-missing-out (FOMO)
syndrome, failure of multiple emerging startups, and more. Post-2015
correction in how investors look at startup valuations, the focus has
been gradually shifting to profitability even as many leading startups
continue to burn significant capital annually.

Importantly, the average time taken by startups to hit the $1-billion
valuation mark stood at 8 years. However, this is declining. From 8.7
years taken by startups founded during 2007-09 period to become a
unicorn, the duration reduced to 2.4 years for startups launched during
2016-17, the report by Orios titled Indian Tech Unicorn noted. While
fintech segment saw the maximum numberof unicorns (11), retail and
software-as-a-service posted six and five unicorns respectively. Data
analytics, online classifieds, logistics, travel, food, and education
were other segments churning out more than one unicorn.

"Most of these (unicorns) are backed by technology and that is the key
differentiating factor between unicorns of the 21st century vs the prior
era. We are proud to be associated with 3 unicorns - Ola, Druva,
Pharmeasy since their early days and look forward to being part of
another 3-5 unicorns over the next few years," said Rehan Yar Khan,
Managing Partner, Orios Venture Partners. Bengaluru had a majority - 41
per cent of these unicorns while 34 per cent were based in Delhi NCR, 14
per cent in Mumbai, and the rest in Pune, Chennai, and Hyderabad.

Over 75% funding decisions to be driven by AI and data analytics by
2025: report

MINT

March 10, 2021 Wednesday

Copyright 2021 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 529 words

Dateline: NEW DELHI

Body

NEW DELHI, March 10 -- More than 75% of venture capital (VC) and
early-stage investment decisions will be driven by artificial
intelligence (AI) and data analytics by 2025, as investors increasingly
turn to data-backed insights for decision making instead of relying
entirely on gut feeling, says a new Gartner report, published March 10.

Gartner has forecast that AI and data science-equipped VC or private
equity (PE) investors will become commonplace in the next 4-5 years,
given the recent advances in data analytics and AI models.

"Successful investors are purported to have a good gut feel- the ability
to make sound financial decisions from mostly qualitative information
alongside the quantitative data provided by the technology company,"
Patrick Stakenas, senior research director at Gartner said in a
statement.

Stakenas said this inability to quantify inner voice grown from personal
experience is decreasingly playing a role in investment decision making.

AI models can help investors by determining the viability, strategy and
potential outcome of an investment in an early-stage startup, based on
past investments, revenue growth, market penetration, consumer sentiment
and their industry experience.

"AI tools will be used to determine how likely a leadership team is to
succeed based on employment history, field expertise and previous
business success," added Stakenas.

Questions such as when to invest, where to invest and how much to invest
are becoming almost automated, he added.

Application of AI is no longer limited to improving operational
efficiency in back office processes. More investment firms have started
using them for core business decision making.

For instance, Sweden based VC firm EQT Ventures has been using a
convolutional neural network, a type of machine learning network, called
Motherbrain to identify potential investments for quite some time.
Motherbrain has reportedly assessed more than 10,000 companies globally
and has played a role in investment decisions worth more than $100
million.

Industry experts believe that post covid-19 market volatility and
associated risks have grown significantly and has made investors realise
that traditional approaches to investment are no longer adequate.

According to business analytics platform CB Insights, nearly 67% of
startups stall at some point in the VC process and fail to exit or raise
funding in subsequent rounds.

Though, this data is not for India, it is indicative of the high failure
rate of startups.

The ongoing digital boom in India has made it a highly lucrative market
for global investors.

In 2020, India received a total of $41 billion in PE and VC investments
from 831 deals as compared to $39 billion in 2019, according to Praxis
Global Alliance.

Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail were the top funded companies.

The year also saw lower exit activity with 148 exits worth $ 5.1
billion, down from 197 exits worth $ 9.2 billion a year ago.

Raza on cloud nine after winning Caribbean league

The Chronicle

September 12, 2020 Saturday

Copyright 2020 The Chronicle All Rights Reserved

Length: 608 words

Body

ZIMBABWE all-rounder, Sikandar Raza, is on cloud nine after winning the
Caribbean Premier League in his debut season with the Trinbago Knight
Riders (TKR) on Thursday night.

The 34-year-old was part of the cast when TKR reclaimed the trophy in
scintillating fashion following an eight wicket victory over St Lucia
Zouks at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad.

St Lucia Zouks were under the guidance of legendary Zimbabwean
cricketer, Andy Flower.

'Speechless about how I feel right now,' Raza tweeted after the game.

'All I can say, massive thanks to Trinbago Knight Riders for the
opportunity and making me feel so welcome.

''Big thanks to the fans, for their messages of love, and support.
Thanks Zimbabwe for sending so much love.'

It was the fourth title for the Knight Riders, which saw them extend
their record as the most successful team in the history of the CPL,
since the tournament started in 2013.

The side made up for their failure, last year, to defend the title.

What was so special about TKR this year was that the team finished the
tournament with a 100 percent winning record.

They nocted up 12 wins from as many games. Raza, who is the first
Zimbabwean to participate in the tournament, featured in seven games and
contributed to the team's success mostly by his off-spin.

He did not get as much opportunities with the bat. The Zimbabwean
finished with seven wickets to his name.

His best performance was when he finished with bowling figures of 3/15
in the 59-run win over St Kitts and Nevis Patriots.

He was selected for the final encounter, on the back of his strong
performances, in the previous matches. Raza bowled two overs which went
for 28 runs and took no wickets as St Lucia Zouks were bowled out for
154 in 19.1 overs.

Knight Riders skipper, Kieron Pollard, was outstanding with ball in hand
as he picked up four wickets for 30 runs in four overs.

Fawad Ahmed and Ali Khan picked up two apiece.

Wicketkeeper Andre Fletcher top scored for the St Lucia Zouks with 39
runs, coming in to bat at number three.

Pollard walked away with the player of the tournament accolade.

Opening batsman, Lendl Simmons, top scored for the Knight Riders with an
unbeaten 84 off 49 deliveries.

His innings was innings made up of eight fours and four sixes to take
home the man-of-the-match award. Simmons put on an unbeaten 138, for the
third wicket with Darren Bravo, who was also not out on 58 from 47
balls. The Knight Riders were coached by Brendon McCullum.

It was the former New Zealand skipper's first trophy as a coach.

Raza was not required to bat as his team won the contest with 11 balls
to spare.

He has become the only cricketer, from Zimbabwe, to lift a trophy in one
of top five Twenty20 competitions on the global scene.

Raza's success could open doors of opportunities for more Zimbabwean
cricketers to play in such leagues.

Flower failed to add a trophy, in the Caribbean, to the ICC T20 World
Cup he won as England coach.

The former Zimbabwe captain picked that success, along with England's
Ashes win in 2010-2011, and the series Test victory in India, as some of
his finest moments.

'The Ashes victory in 2010-11 stands out,' he told the ICC. 'It's
difficult to win in Australia and to do it so comprehensively was a
really proud moment in my coaching career.

'It was wonderful to watch those young men take on that challenge
successfully and have a great time doing it.

'The win in India in 2012-13 was a highlight too, to overcome some great
players in tough, spinning conditions was a special victory.

'So, was the T20 World Cup win in 2010. The way we played our cricket,
with such freedom and aggression, really was fun to be part of.'

Raza on cloud nine after winning Caribbean league

The Chronicle

The Chronicle Harare BureauZIMBABWE all-rounder, Sikandar Raza, is on
cloud nine after winning the Caribbean Premier League in his debut
season with the Trinbago Knight Riders (TKR) on Thursday night. The
34-year-old was part of the cast when TKR reclaimed the trophy in
scintillating fashion following an eight wicket victory over St Lucia
Zouks at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad.

St Lucia Zouks were under the guidance of legendary Zimbabwean
cricketer, Andy Flower. "Speechless about how I feel right now," Raza
tweeted after the game.

"All I can say, massive thanks to Trinbago Knight Riders for the
opportunity and making me feel so welcome. '"Big thanks to the fans, for
their messages of love, and support.

Thanks Zimbabwe for sending so much love." It was the fourth title for
the Knight Riders, which saw them extend their record as the most
successful team in the history of the CPL, since the tournament started
in 2013. The side made up for their failure, last year, to defend the
title.

What was so special about TKR this year was that the team finished the
tournament with a 100 percent winning record. They nocted up 12 wins
from as many games.

Raza, who is the first Zimbabwean to participate in the tournament,
featured in seven games and contributed to the team's success mostly by
his off-spin. He did not get as much opportunities with the bat.

The Zimbabwean finished with seven wickets to his name. His best
performance was when he finished with bowling figures of 3/15 in the
59-run win over St Kitts and Nevis Patriots.

He was selected for the final encounter, on the back of his strong
performances, in the previous matches. Raza bowled two overs which went
for 28 runs and took no wickets as St Lucia Zouks were bowled out for
154 in 19.1 overs.

Knight Riders skipper, Kieron Pollard, was outstanding with ball in hand
as he picked up four wickets for 30 runs in four overs. Fawad Ahmed and
Ali Khan picked up two apiece.

Wicketkeeper Andre Fletcher top scored for the St Lucia Zouks with 39
runs, coming in to bat at number three. Pollard walked away with the
player of the tournament accolade.

Opening batsman, Lendl Simmons, top scored for the Knight Riders with an
unbeaten 84 off 49 deliveries. His innings was innings made up of eight
fours and four sixes to take home the man-of-the-match award.

Simmons put on an unbeaten 138, for the third wicket with Darren Bravo,
who was also not out on 58 from 47 balls. The Knight Riders were coached
by Brendon McCullum.

It was the former New Zealand skipper's first trophy as a coach. Raza
was not required to bat as his team won the contest with 11 balls to
spare.

He has become the only cricketer, from Zimbabwe, to lift a trophy in one
of top five Twenty20 competitions on the global scene. Raza's success
could open doors of opportunities for more Zimbabwean cricketers to play
in such leagues.

Flower failed to add a trophy, in the Caribbean, to the ICC T20 World
Cup he won as England coach. The former Zimbabwe captain picked that
success, along with England's Ashes win in 2010-2011, and the series
Test victory in India, as some of his finest moments.

Proteas have mountain to climb

Hindustan Times Pune Edition

September 12, 2019 Thursday

Copyright 2019 HT Digital Streams Ltd All Rights Reserved

Length: 843 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Sept. 12 -- January 2018. South Africa's then head coach,
Ottis Gibson, launched a grand 'Vision 2019', a master plan to break the
Proteas' choking streak at the World Cup.

August 2019. Gibson and his entire coaching team got the boot by Cricket
South Africa (CSA). Only three wins in nine matches in England had left
the 'vision' somewhat blurred.

Gibson's blueprint for succeeding involved experimentation and rotation,
all leading up to the big prize. It never came. Retirements, tightly
packed bilateral ODI series leading to fatigue and an injury-list that
kept getting longer right into the World Cup meant that the Proteas
finished seventh-only above Bangladesh, West Indies and Afghanistan. "We
only had 18 months, probably less than 18 months to build a team, so
time was always against us," Gibson would go on to say after the exit.

In less than 18 months, South Africa will go into another ICC event-the
World T20 in Australia, a tournament where they have reached the
semi-finals on two occasions. Shaking away the disappointment of the
bygone World Cup campaign and rebuilding in time for the World T20 is
their big challenge. The journey won't be easy but it offers redemption
too.

The first step on the long road to the World T20 will be taken on Sunday
in Dharamsala, where the three-match T20 series against India begins.
This is South Africa's first assignment post the World Cup meltdown and,
understandably, the squad bears a fresh look.

The last time South Africa toured this part of the world for a T20
series in 2015-16, they prevailed 2-0. Only fast bowler Kagiso Rabada
remains from that squad for the upcoming series. According to SA's
interim team-director Enoch Nkwe-another new face that has been brought
in as part of the post-World Cup shake-up-South Africa have already
begun wiping the slate, starting with Quinton de Kock replacing the
experienced Faf du Plessis as captain in T20Is.

"It's also an opportunity to start building for the future. We know
where Faf stands, as a captain and as a player. He's done great things
for South African cricket. We also need to look at what the future looks
like. We believe in Quinton, who's going to be leading the team in this
series," Nkwe, the coach-cum-manager, said during his first press meet
in Dharamsala.

"The T20 series gives us the last chance to have a look at our
leadership and batting options as the next edition of the T20 World Cup
is now little more than a year away, which is why we have gone with an
inexperienced leadership group," Corrie van Zyl, CSA's acting director
of cricket, had said before the team's departure.

For de Kock, who came into the limelight with three successive ODI tons
against India at home in 2013, his promotion to the captain's post is a
gradual progression of a player who was primed to be major force in the
South African line-up. At the World Cup, he was one of the three South
African batsmen, along with du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen, to
tally more than 300 runs and yet it was his failure to convert his
starts into big scores that ended up hurting South Africa.

"Coming into this series, we've got a lot of new players. Win or lose, I
just want the guys to keep competing, keep fighting. As long as they
keep doing that, I'm sure we'll be in good hands," said de Kock. "We've
got quite a young team, so there will be a lot of energy. I'm looking
forward to that." Of course he is, given he struck two centuries and 318
runs the last time South Africa played an ODI series in India, back in
2015-16.

Not everyone who failed in England and Wales has been ignored. The South
Africans have included eight players from the World Cup squad in the
14-man T20 unit for the India tour. Seven of those eight are returning
from a period away from cricket, while only Beuran Hendricks featured in
an A-series.

Aiden Markram and Lungi Ngidi, both of whom starred in the Test series
when India toured South Africa in 2018, will feature in the long-format
leg of this tour, starting in Visakhapatnam early next month.

The squad features four T20 debutants in batsman Temba Bavuma, left-arm
spinner Bjorn Fortuin, all-rounder George Linde and fast bowler Anrich
Nortje. All four were part of the South Africa A side that played in the
recently-concluded one-day series against India A. Three other members
from that A side are in the T20 side.

And it is not only the T20s that will see players earning international
caps. The Test squad has a possible debutant in Nortje, wicketkeeper
Rudi Second and spinning allrounder Senuran Muthusamy.

"We're looking to invest in a good foundation going into the T20 World
Cup next year in Australia. But we still have a lot of games. We have
about 20 games. So we'll reassess the situation after these three games
against India and see where we're at. For now, the focus is this
upcoming series," Nkwe said.

From big boss to employee again

Times of India (Electronic Edition)

September 8, 2018 Saturday

Jaipur Edition

Section: STARTUP STORIES

Length: 944 words

Byline: Ranjani Ayyar

Highlight: When startups hire founders of failed ventures, they bring on
board committed risk-takers

Body

Krish Subramanian, cofounder of SaaS startup Chargebee, finds himself in
a unique place. Close to 10% of his 160-strong team are former founders.
Was this by design or chance? The latter, he says.

With the failure rate amongst startups as high as 70% to 90% (depending
on which study you believe), these founders are bound to find their way
back into the ecosystem if they choose not to try a business again \x97
but it's not always easy to transition from owner to employee.

For founders who join startups, dealing with failure includes
acknowledging that their startup journey has helped them. \x93My biggest
learning was that you are better equipped in the job market after an
entrepreneurial stint,\x94 said Sampath Jagannathan, who ran Brigge, a
social network startup that shut shop last year due to lack of funds.

Subramanian says former founders make for employees who have a strong
sense of commitment. \x93They don't define boundaries. They take
ownership for their work and the company's success,\x94 he says.

Ankur Nandu, now project manager at Chargebee was founder and CEO of
Canvass, an integrated marketing platform for six years. \x93Founders
are open to partnerships, collaboration, whatever it takes to make the
company a success. And that mindset stays even if you're no longer a
founder but an employee,\x94 he says.

When a startup has as many 'founders' on its rolls as Chargebee does, it
has a cascading effect. \x93It brings in an entrepreneurial culture and
gives people heroes to shadow,\x94 says Subramanian.

While Chargebee hired all the former founders now on its rolls, Girish
Mathrubootham of Freshworks has several founders who came in through
acquisitions. With nine acquisitions till date, Freshworks has close to
15-20 former founders as employees.

\x93Once you are an entrepreneur, you look at problems differently. When
you've run your own company, the need to solve the problem comes
naturally,\x94 Mathrubootham says. \x93When the company grows, it is
easier to get people who will follow the established path. Sometimes you
need to break this and create a new way of doing things. Again, this
comes more naturally to an entrepreneur.\x94

Close to 20 former founders work in software product company Capillary
Technologies. Aneesh Reddy, co-founder and CEO, says having them on the
team as the company evolves is crucial. \x93As the company grows, you
need people who are ambidextrous and former founders generally fit the
bill.\x94 Rohan Mahadar, who used to run his own company and joined
Capillary after a corporate stint, heads Instore AI, the company's AI
and machine learning product for retail. The product was the fastest to
hit a million dollars run rate, says Reddy. He adds that an
entrepreneurial stint humbles a person. \x93As a founder, you have done
everything from being the peon to the CEO.\x94

Arpit Agarwal of Blume Ventures says in many cases, founders walk the
extra mile to find a position for a former entrepreneur even though the
skill-wise fit may not be obvious. For instance, when Amrutash Misra
approached Chargebee after a few years as an entrepreneur, there was no
open position. The Chargebee co-founders created one for him as creative
director.

For former founders, the relief of becoming an employee is doing away
with what Misra describes as \x93decision fatigue\x94. Misra used to run
MultiStory Learning, a startup in the English learning space, which
continues to operate under his co-founders. \x93I reached a point where
I didn't want to make any decisions. I needed to pause and slow down. As
a founder, every decision is yours and it can get tough,\x94 he says.

Not having to worry about macro issues came as a relief to Vaibhav Garg,
who now works at Zoppr. He ran Indihaat, a handicrafts retail company,
for two years before he shut shop. \x93The buck doesn't stop with me
here. Aspects like funding, meeting targets, acceleration were always on
my mind when I was a founder. At Zoppr, I have the liberty to not worry
about these,\x94 he says.

Srikrishnan Ganesan, who ran mobile-first user engagement platform
Konotor before the company got acquired by Freshworks in 2015, says he
has the best of both worlds now. \x93If you're leading a team, it's
still the same. The benefit is that you have a sounding board, in the
form of a boss, and greater resources,\x94 he says. When he and his
co-founders ran Konotor, they didn't have expertise in areas like
digital marketing, HR and law. \x93We can now focus on what we enjoy
\x97 building the product. HR is managed by a team as is legal.\x94
Ganesan leads a team of 50 that works on Freshchat, a product of
Freshworks.

The pace can get difficult for former founders. Mathrubootham invests
time in working with founders essentail processes like quality check.

Ganesan adds that if a former founder comes with the wrong expectations,
it can get tough. \x93If you think you are getting access to more
resources without reins, you're wrong. You need to prove yourself within
the company.\x94

For the employer, it's not always easy working with former founders.
\x93When people come from different systems, they need to be taught to
welcome disagreement. There is learning to do and this is something I
tell all employees, not just former founders,\x94 says Mathrubootham. He
says former founders come with a big appetite and need to be given
meaningful problems to solve.

\x93Founders are fiercely independent. They need the right level of
alignment and direction to make sure they are performing optimally,\x94
says Agarwal of Blume Ventures. \x93It's not about altruism. Some
ex-founders have gone on to make their new employers wildly
successful.\x94

Startup salaries swell amid pandemic-induced funding boom

The Economic Times

April 3, 2021 Saturday

Section: STARTUPS

Length: 1107 words

Mumbai: Increased demand for technology talent, following an accelerated
focus on digital adoption by businesses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is
making hiring expensive, especially for early-stage startups, multiple
founders and recruiters told ET.Engineers, data analysts, developers and
product managers in the three-to-seven-year experience bracket are often
being hired for up to 50% higher salaries than industry levels by
startups flush with investor capital.Founders and investors say the
current "hiring bubble" is reminiscent of 2014-2015 when the funding
boom inflated salaries-the first time for the Indian startup
ecosystem-on the back of massive funding that the likes of homegrown
e-commerce company Flipkart received.At the onset of the Covid-19
pandemic, companies had to retrench staff, but as the wheels of the
economy picked up pace and the adoption of technology accelerated, funds
flowed into startups in the fintech, Software as a Service (SaaS),
edtech space, and for platforms enabling small and medium-sized
businesses to go digital.This led early-stage startups to hire at
increased salaries compared to pre-pandemic levels, the industry
insiders said.Yap, a banking and payments-focussed infrastructure
provider which recently closed a $10 million Series B round, has grown
from 70 employees in March last year to over 200 now, said co-founder
Madhusudanan R. As they continue to hire for tech roles, he said
companies are willing to pay 70-80% more to retain core talent."The
hiring boom will lead to the same issue that happened in 2015 when
salaries were inflated at junior levels-it becomes unsustainable, which
leads to companies not getting profitable anytime soon," said Ashish
Dave, chief executive officer of Mirae Asset Venture Investments, which
has deployed over $200 million in India across companies like Ola,
Zomato and BigBasket over the last two years."The logic this time is -
'I did not get a hike last year because of Covid-19. This year, I should
get a double increment'," said Mandeep Manocha, co-founder and CEO of
Cashify, an online reseller of mobile phones and other gadgets that

recently raised $15 million in Series D funding and began rehiring in
September when business activity normalised.Early-Stage Funding
BoomDemand for top tech talent increased multifold as average deal sizes
across sectors rose substantially in the past eight months. Funding
rounds are closing in record time and startups are raising more capital
than planned, ET reported on March 18.In the first three months of this
year, seed-stage rounds averaged $1.1 million, while Series A rounds
have averaged at $5.1 million across 32 financing rounds, according to
data till March 2 by Tracxn, a research platform that tracks data for
privately held companies.Deepak Abbot, founder of gold monetisation
platform Indiagold, said the slug of capital comes with an expectation
to grow faster, which requires quality talent."The problem is for
startups in the middle where you suddenly become big too fast. The money
has to go into hiring. When startups want to quickly hire multiple
engineers, that's where the trouble begins," Abbot said.In general,
engineering and tech talent used to ask for a 15-20% jump but that has
gone up to around 30-40%, a recruiter who did not want to be named
said.Job offers being declined have gone up to 45-50% from 25-30%, said
Anshuman Das, CEO of CareerNet and Longhouse Consulting, which counts
Flipkart, Goldman Sachs and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. among its
clients.Demand & Supply MismatchStartups are also facing stiff
competition from offline businesses that were forced to adopt a digital
strategy and multinational firms that have come into the mix due to
remote work taking off, which further pushed salary expectations."Tech
hiring in the last 4-5 months has been peaking to unprecedented levels,"
Das said.Social e-commerce startup DealShare is trying to retain and
recruit talent by relying on its internal network for referrals, said
founder Sourjyendu Medda. "While it's been challenging from the
availability of talent and cost perspective, we have been able to hire
and retain good talent."The talent supply crunch led fintech unicorn
Pine Labs to expand its hiring pool outside of product companies and
into IT service companies that are increasingly getting into digital
technology, said Anu Mathew, its chief people officer. While Pine Labs
does not have the typical challenges of a smaller startup, it is
competing to hire from a limited pool of top-notch talent that is always
in demand, she said. "Pine Labs is looking at significant growth in the
coming year. For us, the challenge is not only to bring them on board,
but also to help them perform to their potential, which I think is a
tougher challenge," Mathew said.New dilemmaThe dilemma facing founders
is when to cave in and when to walk away from the salary hike being
demanded by employees.Bharath Bevinahally, co-founder of Omidyar Network
India-funded preschool learning app Kutuki, said the right talent is
almost always worth the price. "On pure compensation alone, it's pretty
tough to compete with some of the salaries being offered...but a really
good candidate who ticks the boxes on culture fit and is an eager
learner with demonstrated abilities is worth it," he added.However,
agreeing to these eye-popping salaries can lead to internal issues."We
evaluate whether it's sustainable for us and how it will affect team
dynamics because we will obviously not be able to afford those salaries
in other functions. This may create mismatch in the team dynamics which
is also a consideration," the founder of a Mumbai-based seed-stage
fintech company said.Shopping for offers is the usual tool to snag
better job offers for in-demand roles."We have seen that the candidates
are now getting four offers instead of one or two like before, which is
really heating up the market. Also, attrition has gone up," Das of
Longhouse Consulting said.Cash Over ESOPsFor early-stage startups that
are competing with well-funded startups and multinational firms,
offering Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) has been a way to make
up for the shortfall in compensation.But, junior-level engineers and
mid-level hires show reluctance toward availing ESOPs and there is an
inclination towards more take-home pay. Failure rates among startups
post-Series A still remain high and employees don't have the risk
appetite for holding stock."As the ecosystem evolves and matures and
there are more exits happening, the benefits of ESOPs will be more
visible," Bevinahally said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

than industry levels by startups flush with investor capital. Founders
and investors say the current "hiring bubble" is reminiscent of
2014-2015 when the funding boom inflated salaries-the first time for the
Indian startup ecosystem-on the back of massive funding that the likes
of homegrown e-commerce company Flipkart received. At the onset of the
Covid-19 pandemic, companies had to retrench staff, but as the wheels of
the economy picked up pace and the adoption of technology accelerated,
funds flowed into startups in the fintech, Software as a Service (SaaS),
edtech space, and for platforms enabling small and medium-sized
businesses to go digital. This led early-stage startups to hire at
increased salaries compared to pre-pandemic levels, the industry
insiders said. Yap, a banking and payments-focussed infrastructure
provider which recently closed a $10 million Series B round, has grown
from 70 employees in March last year to over 200 now, said co-founder
Madhusudanan R. As they continue to hire for tech roles, he said
companies are willing to pay 70-80% more to retain core talent. "The
hiring boom will lead to the same issue that happened in 2015 when
salaries were inflated at junior levels-it becomes unsustainable, which
leads to companies not getting profitable anytime soon," said Ashish
Dave, chief executive officer of Mirae Asset Venture Investments, which
has deployed over $200 million in India across companies like Ola,
Zomato and BigBasket over the last two years. "The logic this time is -
'I did not get a hike last year because of Covid-19. This year, I should
get a double increment'," said Mandeep Manocha, co-founder and CEO of
Cashify, an online reseller of mobile phones and other gadgets that
recently raised $15 million in Series D funding and began rehiring in
September when business activity normalised.  

Early-Stage Funding Boom

 

Demand for top tech talent increased multifold as average deal sizes
across sectors rose substantially in the past eight months. Funding
rounds are closing in record time and startups are raising more capital
than planned, ET reported on March 18. 

In the first three months of this year, seed-stage rounds averaged $1.1
million, while Series A rounds have averaged at $5.1 million across 32
financing rounds, according to data till March 2 by Tracxn, a research
platform that tracks data for privately held companies. 

Deepak Abbot, founder of gold monetisation platform Indiagold, said the
slug of capital comes with an expectation to grow faster, which requires
quality talent. 

"The problem is for startups in the middle where you suddenly become big
too fast. The money has to go into hiring. When startups want to quickly
hire multiple engineers, that's where the trouble begins," Abbot said. 

In general, engineering and tech talent used to ask for a 15-20% jump
but that has gone up to around 30-40%, a recruiter who did not want to
be named said. 

Job offers being declined have gone up to 45-50% from 25-30%, said
Anshuman Das, CEO of CareerNet and Longhouse Consulting, which counts
Flipkart, Goldman Sachs and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. among its
clients. 

Demand & Supply Mismatch

 

Startups are also facing stiff competition from offline businesses that
were forced to adopt a digital strategy and multinational firms that
have come into the mix due to remote work taking off, which further
pushed salary expectations. 

"Tech hiring in the last 4-5 months has been peaking to unprecedented
levels," Das said. 

Social e-commerce startup DealShare is trying to retain and recruit
talent by relying on its internal network for referrals, said founder
Sourjyendu Medda. "While it's been challenging from the availability of
talent and cost perspective, we have been able to hire and retain good
talent." 

The talent supply crunch led fintech unicorn Pine Labs to expand its
hiring pool outside of product companies and into IT service companies
that are increasingly getting into digital technology, said Anu Mathew,
its chief people officer. While Pine Labs does not have the typical
challenges of a smaller startup, it is competing to hire from a limited
pool of top-notch talent that is always in demand, she said. "Pine Labs
is looking at significant growth in the coming year. For us, the
challenge is not only to bring them on board, but also to help them
perform to their potential, which I think is a tougher challenge,"
Mathew said. 

New dilemma

 

The dilemma facing founders is when to cave in and when to walk away
from the salary hike being demanded by employees. 

Bharath Bevinahally, co-founder of Omidyar Network India-funded
preschool learning app Kutuki, said the right talent is almost always
worth the price. "On pure compensation alone, it's pretty tough to
compete with some of the salaries being offered...but a really good
candidate who ticks the boxes on culture fit and is an eager learner
with demonstrated abilities is worth it," he added. 

However, agreeing to these eye-popping salaries can lead to internal
issues. 

"We evaluate whether it's sustainable for us and how it will affect team
dynamics because we will obviously not be able to afford those salaries
in other functions. This may create mismatch in the team dynamics which
is also a consideration," the founder of a Mumbai-based seed-stage
fintech company said. 

Shopping for offers is the usual tool to snag better job offers for
in-demand roles. 

"We have seen that the candidates are now getting four offers instead of
one or two like before, which is really heating up the market. Also,
attrition has gone up," Das of Longhouse Consulting said. 

 

Cash Over ESOPs

 

For early-stage startups that are competing with well-funded startups
and multinational firms, offering Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)
has been a way to make up for the shortfall in compensation. 

But, junior-level engineers and mid-level hires show reluctance toward
availing ESOPs and there is an inclination towards more take-home pay.
Failure rates among startups post-Series A still remain high and
employees don't have the risk appetite for holding stock. 

"As the ecosystem evolves and matures and there are more exits
happening, the benefits of ESOPs will be more visible," Bevinahally
said.

From big boss to employee again

Times of India (Electronic Edition)

September 3, 2018 Monday

Section: STARTUP STORIES

Length: 944 words

Byline: Ranjani Ayyar

Highlight: When startups hire founders of failed ventures, they bring on
board committed risk-takers

Body

Krish Subramanian, cofounder of SaaS startup Chargebee, finds himself in
a unique place. Close to 10% of his 160-strong team are former founders.
Was this by design or chance? The latter, he says.

With the failure rate amongst startups as high as 70% to 90% (depending
on which study you believe), these founders are bound to find their way
back into the ecosystem if they choose not to try a business again \x97
but it's not always easy to transition from owner to employee.

For founders who join startups, dealing with failure includes
acknowledging that their startup journey has helped them. \x93My biggest
learning was that you are better equipped in the job market after an
entrepreneurial stint,\x94 said Sampath Jagannathan, who ran Brigge, a
social network startup that shut shop last year due to lack of funds.

Subramanian says former founders make for employees who have a strong
sense of commitment. \x93They don't define boundaries. They take
ownership for their work and the company's success,\x94 he says.

Ankur Nandu, now project manager at Chargebee was founder and CEO of
Canvass, an integrated marketing platform for six years. \x93Founders
are open to partnerships, collaboration, whatever it takes to make the
company a success. And that mindset stays even if you're no longer a
founder but an employee,\x94 he says.

When a startup has as many 'founders' on its rolls as Chargebee does, it
has a cascading effect. \x93It brings in an entrepreneurial culture and
gives people heroes to shadow,\x94 says Subramanian.

While Chargebee hired all the former founders now on its rolls, Girish
Mathrubootham of Freshworks has several founders who came in through
acquisitions. With nine acquisitions till date, Freshworks has close to
15-20 former founders as employees.

\x93Once you are an entrepreneur, you look at problems differently. When
you've run your own company, the need to solve the problem comes
naturally,\x94 Mathrubootham says. \x93When the company grows, it is
easier to get people who will follow the established path. Sometimes you
need to break this and create a new way of doing things. Again, this
comes more naturally to an entrepreneur.\x94

Close to 20 former founders work in software product company Capillary
Technologies. Aneesh Reddy, co-founder and CEO, says having them on the
team as the company evolves is crucial. \x93As the company grows, you
need people who are ambidextrous and former founders generally fit the
bill.\x94 Rohan Mahadar, who used to run his own company and joined
Capillary after a corporate stint, heads Instore AI, the company's AI
and machine learning product for retail. The product was the fastest to
hit a million dollars run rate, says Reddy. He adds that an
entrepreneurial stint humbles a person. \x93As a founder, you have done
everything from being the peon to the CEO.\x94

Arpit Agarwal of Blume Ventures says in many cases, founders walk the
extra mile to find a position for a former entrepreneur even though the
skill-wise fit may not be obvious. For instance, when Amrutash Misra
approached Chargebee after a few years as an entrepreneur, there was no
open position. The Chargebee co-founders created one for him as creative
director.

For former founders, the relief of becoming an employee is doing away
with what Misra describes as \x93decision fatigue\x94. Misra used to run
MultiStory Learning, a startup in the English learning space, which
continues to operate under his co-founders. \x93I reached a point where
I didn't want to make any decisions. I needed to pause and slow down. As
a founder, every decision is yours and it can get tough,\x94 he says.

Not having to worry about macro issues came as a relief to Vaibhav Garg,
who now works at Zoppr. He ran Indihaat, a handicrafts retail company,
for two years before he shut shop. \x93The buck doesn't stop with me
here. Aspects like funding, meeting targets, acceleration were always on
my mind when I was a founder. At Zoppr, I have the liberty to not worry
about these,\x94 he says.

Srikrishnan Ganesan, who ran mobile-first user engagement platform
Konotor before the company got acquired by Freshworks in 2015, says he
has the best of both worlds now. \x93If you're leading a team, it's
still the same. The benefit is that you have a sounding board, in the
form of a boss, and greater resources,\x94 he says. When he and his
co-founders ran Konotor, they didn't have expertise in areas like
digital marketing, HR and law. \x93We can now focus on what we enjoy
\x97 building the product. HR is managed by a team as is legal.\x94
Ganesan leads a team of 50 that works on Freshchat, a product of
Freshworks.

The pace can get difficult for former founders. Mathrubootham invests
time in working with founders essentail processes like quality check.

Ganesan adds that if a former founder comes with the wrong expectations,
it can get tough. \x93If you think you are getting access to more
resources without reins, you're wrong. You need to prove yourself within
the company.\x94

For the employer, it's not always easy working with former founders.
\x93When people come from different systems, they need to be taught to
welcome disagreement. There is learning to do and this is something I
tell all employees, not just former founders,\x94 says Mathrubootham. He
says former founders come with a big appetite and need to be given
meaningful problems to solve.

\x93Founders are fiercely independent. They need the right level of
alignment and direction to make sure they are performing optimally,\x94
says Agarwal of Blume Ventures. \x93It's not about altruism. Some
ex-founders have gone on to make their new employers wildly
successful.\x94

Tremendous potential in Medical tourism and Wellness tourism business

If you are looking to set up a unique startup, the following facts and
figures will help you create a vision about the tremendous business
potential in this sector.

* Post-pandemic, the pent-up demand for beyond the border healthcare
services is unimaginable.38% of global cancer surgeries got cancelled.

* Millions of patients are waiting for surgeries since the last 2 years,
and clearing this massive backlog cannot happen overnight.

* Patient waiting times are likely to worsen in some countries.

* Not only dental treatments and cosmetic surgeries, a Bloomberg report
says, startups expect treatments in critical illness to account for 80%
of medical tourism business in the next few years.

* In 2016, nearly 14 million people spent $68 billion on medical tourism
reports PwC.

* Foreign patients nearly spend $6000 per trip accounting for a
cumulative spending of up to $72 billion.

by 2025.

* Secondary wellness travelers to whom wellness activities are secondary
accounted for 92% of wellness trips and 90% of wellness tourism related
expenditures in 2020.

* Wellness tourism expenditures account for 17% of the worldwide travel
expenditures.

* Medical tourists are likely to opt for more wellness activities in
selected destinations as a part of their recovery program.

Complexities in medical tourism have multiplied than one can think of.
And here lies opportunities for medical tourism and wellness tourism
business startups.

Medical tourism is something more than treatment and tourism

The entire journey of medical tourists is not only about getting the
treatment done and healing but also a lot more. They also look for full
mind-body rejuvenation so that they can lead quality life when back
home. Their journey covers a long chain of touchpoints which if not
taken careof create painful experience for patients. There has been a
persistent gap in quality service offerings which just got widened after
the pandemic. There is a dire need to fill this gap with right
solutions.

Redundant medical tourism business models don't work

Countless medical tourism companies perished due to the pandemic-induced
travel restrictions. And the old model of business is not going to work
anymore because the problems are no longer the same as before.Patients'
demands are also witnessing a rapid shift. This is the opportune moment
to set up medical tourism and wellness tourism startups. Prospective
medical tourists are left with few choices who would help them go
through the journey seamlessly.

Patients demand delightful experiences not mere satisfactory experiences

Expert medical tourism and wellness tourism consultants, advisors, and
marketers are equivocal in this regard. As the patient's demand graph
shoots up, innovative startups tapping these intangible factors in
patient experience are sure winners.

Patient's painpoints are more than you can think of

More the complexities more are the painpoints and greater will be the
demand for great solutions. Travel restrictions, rising airfares,
threats of infection, global inflation, war and conflicts are making
things more difficult. While we talk of innovation and uniqueness in
medical tourism and wellness tourism startups, offering great solutions
to patients' painpoints is the best way for acquisition and retention.
You gradually build a loyal customer base that adds to your business
sustainability.

Medical wellness experience- the new normal experience

Medical tourists now seek holistic experiences that cover consultation,
treatment, hospital stay, recovery, and mind-relaxing rejuvenating
exercises. It may not be always shopping and site seeing but regaining
well-being in a meaningful way to stave off diseases or manage chronic
conditions better.

Medical tourists will opt for long stay for healing

Cure and healing have taken different dimensions. While the prepandemic
scenario was just to get the treatment done and fly back home, post
pandemic scenario is quite different. Patients are more interested in
holistic healing to wipe away the last bit of stress, strain, and
anxiety of pre-treatment suffering. They are more eager for quality long
stay recuperative process and willing to pay a premium for the
associated services and products.

Travel has become synonymous to healing

Travel has become more wellness focused after the massive shakeup of the
global pandemic.Chronic stress and disrupted lifestyle have pushed
individuals on the brink of burnout. In a recent survey from American
Express, 76% of respondents are willing to spend more on travel that
helps in enhancing their well-being.55% of them are eager to pay a
premium for wellness activities in their upcoming vacations.

Post-pandemic travelers are seekers. Instead of cramming popular
destinations, they are looking for nature experiences, holistic wellness
experiences, adventure, and exploration in the most fulfilling way.
Wellness resorts, wellness tourism facilitators, wellhomes, wellness
guides, coaches, and therapists are just a few cogs of the wellness
wheel.

Wellness vacation modes are expanding

Vacationing is no more /just a short duration activity-packed
destination visit. Slow travel, mixing vacation and work, staying at a
second home, or spending few days in nature away from home are emerging
trends in wellness travel. We have been seeing rapid emergence of
staycations, workcations, drivecations, schoolcations, etc. aimed at a
balanced work-life-play-wellbeing situation. Even if travellers are not
entirely focused on wellness, they do take interest in unique
experiences conducive to their mental and emotional wellbeing.

Hospitality gets the wellness touch

Gone are the days of crammed hotels and accommodations. Discerning
travelers are looking for wellness spaces for enhanced sensory
experiences. Existing hospitality facilities are going for wellness
makeover not only through back-office integration but emerging as
wellness hospitality brands.

Medical Tourism and Wellness Tourism Startups are getting investors'
attention

Despite all the pall and gloom in the medical tourism market due to
covid, medical tourism and wellness tourism startups are bagging great
fundings from institutional investors. This is largely an untapped
market, and the emerging factors do create a positive outlook.

Global population has accepted to live with the virus. And how long can
patients postpone their healthcare needs? The urgency that is brewing is
yet to come to surface with full throttle. Institutional investors are
keeping an eye on recent happenings in medical tourism and wellness
tourism market, and will be eager to put their money for some bigger
returns.

Why do you need funding?

Whether you self-fund your medical tourism and wellness tourism business
or take help from family and friends, your funding needs will be more as
you cruise along.

Top reasons are likely:

* Launch your business if your self-financing efforts fall short to
achieve the critical amount.

* Expand and diversify your business by hiring, introducing new
technology or launching new products and services.

* Make yourself visible to a larger market segment.

* Most importantly, prove legitimacy and add credibility to your
business.

How much investment do you need?

It depends upon your proposed business model and mode of operations. The
initial investment can be anything between $1000-$5000. To open a
medical tourism agency, the recommended startup investment could be
around $27000, which is quite feasible given the expected higher ROI.
Another great thing about medical tourism and wellness tourism business
is that you can launch it from your home. Therefore, you may not need an
astronomically high funding amount to set up a swanky office or hire a
big workforce.

Before thinking of getting funding for your medical tourism and wellness
tourism business, you need to have a clear vision about what role you
are going to play in the market? What value you will add to customers?
You have a plethora of options to explore.

Again, the investment will depend upon what you plan to offer and other
aspects related to business operations. As your startup gets
operational, you will need wellness tourism and medical tourism
consultants to plan your funding through potential investors for further
diversification and brand building.

Tips to get quick funding for your medical tourism and wellness tourism
startup

Although funding from VCs in startups touched new highs, they take a
very cautious approach while investing in new startups. Here we share a
few valuable tips to get quick funding for your medical tourism and
wellness tourism strartup.

Do Reverse Engineering in Investment

Did you know that startups bagged $156 billion investment in 2020 up by
$56 billion from the previous year?

What is the business potential of the industry? Check the salient points
listed above. What are your offerings and who are the potential takers?
Work backward to understand your sales potential that will justify your
investment and investor's needs.

Plan investment and funding Expenses stepwise

90% of businesses fail due to a weak business model and faulty expense
planning.

Your chances of securing investment rest on some key pillars. Work on
your business concept and philosophy. Apart from profiteering, Medical
tourism and Wellness tourism businesses should display the humanitarian
purpose. Build your philosophy on that.

Many institutional investors get attracted towards humanitarian and
community upliftment purpose. Capital is flowing in businesses that help
to improve people's daily lives. Do a feasibility analysis. Be mindful
of product and service development. Get your financial projections
right.

Create a strong and crisp business plan

A study shows entrepreneurs with a written formal business plan get more
formal financial assistance than those without a plan. 70% VCs perceive
a written business plan very important.

No great idea should be in your head but put down on a paper. Investors
will see what is in front of them not what is hidden in your brain.
Convincing medical tourism and wellness tourism business cannot be done
verbally. You need to document those.

Is your startup worth the investors' risk? Why the investor will put
money in your business? A strong business plan will bear the testimony
to it. What are your objectives? How will you serve the medical tourism
and wellness tourism market? Most importantly, what difference you are
going to make in the existing scenario? All of these should be clearly
defined in the business plan.

Your plan should also talk about in details:

* Complete description of your offerings

* Your deep understanding of the target market and business viability

* Competitive analysis

* Financial projections

* Growth forecast model

* Elaborate marketing plan

* Pricing and promotional strategies

* Barriers to entry in the market

Understand the technicality of Investment

Global funding grew by $8 Billion in 2021

The scenario is encouraging but that does not give you the reason to put
lesser efforts. You need to have a deep understanding of the investors
and the different mechanisms that go into the startup investment
ecosystem. Get educated about angel investors, seed funding, venture
capital, and equity investments. How they work and what is required from
you to get the funding from them. Devote enough time to study all these
factors. Enrolling in medical tourism masterclasses or startup training
courses will help.

How unique is your medical tourism and wellness tourism startup?

Did you know that 90% of startups fail and 34% of startups fail to do so
due to a lack of product-fit market?

This means, either your offering is inadequate or the market does not
exist. You need to envisage the best of ideas that will help in solving
some real problems of medical tourists and wellness enthusiasts. The
best ideas can only develop if you have a deep study of the market and
the customers' needs and wants. Higher their demands better are your
chances to get new ideas.

Did you know90% of unique business ideas fail in the first five years?
You need to ensure everything is right in your business model, business
plan, financial projections, marketing plans, hiring, etc.

Show networking and partnership

Small companies with Content Marketing and social media generate 67%
more leads

What people say about you impacts your chances of getting business
funding. Build your followers and customers on social media platforms
like Facebook and Instagram. Collect video reviews along with text
reviews to add credibility about your offerings. Social media platforms
create the opportunity to reach out to bigger audience. Use Linkedin to
build your professional credibility, partnerships and connect with
potential investors. Flaunt these while pitching for funding.

Practice minimalism - Focus on a lean model

66% of startups face financial challenges with 43% claiming meeting
operating expenses as the biggest challenge.

Medical tourism and wellness tourism cover a lot of touch points, and
creating a great business model needs adequate brainstorming. A lean,
efficient, smart, and scalable business model will easily catch the
investors' attention who will feel secured about much lesser chances of
unwanted expenses. Flawed business model with too much redundant
activities is one of the critical factors of startup failure. When you
aim at lean model, you automatically take care of optimal resource
utilization that supports your sustainability and scalability.

Tap the investors' mindset

A recent survey says, more than 78% of small businesses reported
profits.

Your investor should be able to relate well with your idea, else the
entire project may not go well. You may miss the desired profit. To
select the right investor for your medical tourism and wellness tourism
startup, you need to tap the investor's mind.

Medical tourism and wellness tourism business brings in lots of
intangible benefits which make many investors take interest in such
ventures. Many medical tourism businesses have been founded on the basis
of strong emotional factors from real life experiences.

The investor's reputation is important but you need the following as
well:

* How well the investor can be an influencer?

* What are their special interests or what is drawing them to your
business?

* Do they strongly believe in your ideas?

* Do they have any additional pleasure points in investing in this kind
of business?

* Will they give you enough room to execute your plans?

Join incubator programs

Business incubators can help in reducing the launching and operating
cost of a startup by 40-50%

Your medical tourism and wellness tourism startup can go haywire if
there are certain loopholes in the business model especially during the
early stages. These businesses have lots of complexities which could
pose serious obstacles for new entrants. Incubator programs are
tremendously helpful in providing guidance, mentorship, and build your
business networking. Do a background check of the mentors and
professionals on board and their success storiesThis will not only
streamline your operating expenses but also help in finding the right
investor for you.

Think of a strategic investor

Strategic investors have an increasing share in startup investments and
can boost 60% revenues

Strategic investors mean you have readily available capital. While VCs
take a more cautious approach to funding, investments from strategic
investors in early stage startups have shot up tremendously. Though
these investments come with a few strings attached, their knowledge,
outreach, and resources can propel your business growth. But be well
informed of their interests and settle for a win-win situation.

Participate in meetings and conferences

57% agree that networking events help you get the right investor

Investors in medical tourism and wellness tourism business are not
omnipresent. You need to really hunt for them at times. Global Medical
Tourism and Wellness Tourism conferences are held round the year in
different countries. In some countries, these are regular annual events.
Participating in these events means you land on a big platform where you
get rare opportunities to meet potential investors and providers.Do your
homework properly to make yourself presentable in the international
platform.

Your pitch deck should leave an impression

Even 10 slides are enough for an impressive pitch deck for new entrants
to get the right investment

All your great ideas and potential of medical tourism and wellness
tourism business could go down the drain if your pitch deck is bland and
shoddy. Too long presentation with overwhelming information can put off
your potential investors. New entrants are more likely to get into these
erroneous steps. It is hard for them to decide which information to keep
and which to discard.Keep your presentation short and crisp. Your
business propositions and related information should be presented in a
neat flow. Your investors will be impressed and appreciate you for
valuing their time.

Hire a recognized consultant

Running out of cash is the second most common cause of startup failure
around 29%

Great ideas do not always fetch good funding. Lack of insights, and
exposure pose big problems for getting funding. These are common
happenings when your business is in full operation but you need
additional funds to make it grow more. This is one of the reasons that
many startups shut down after 3-5 years in the market. A recognized
consultant will never allow your cash flow to dry up but help you get
timely funding.

There are several alternate means to get funding but to make things
faster and smooth, you need to follow the above tips.

ABSTRACT

Hima Tk had a successful career in management consulting before
realising she needed to do something more challenging and impactful.

FULL TEXT

Parents have it hard already, without the added problem of finding ways
to extend their children's education. That's why Hima Tk founded
InquiBox, a subscription service that delivers a package full of
play-based, STEM education activities for kids every month. Born in
India, she had a successful career in management consulting before
realising she needed to do something more challenging and impactful.
Through accelerator programs and a lot of hard work, she's learnt how to
be a startup founder. Starting with STEM  "InquiBox designs and delivers
educational activity subscription boxes for children aged 7 to 12 years
old, so they can learn through play," Hima Tk tells Duct Tape. "We
explore a different STEM topic in every box we send out. It's a
combination of a physical box and event platform, through which we
facilitate a tactile learning environment. "The problem we are trying to
solve is that modern parents know STEM education is important, but they
lack the tools, time and resources to make STEM engaging and fun for
children. So our product helps parents save time. They don't have to go
out and look for toys or games to make STEM learning easier for
children, we have packaged it up and sent it directly to the home so
that parents have the tools and resources ready for them, and children
can either play with them alone or with the parents.  "Although we've
been going for 18 months, we just officially launched the product and
started generating revenue about three months ago. At the moment we have
about 50 subscribers across Australia, but we have some ambitious growth
targets."  Leaving corporate life behind  "I was working as a management
consultant in Australia until, one and a half years back now, I decided
to leave and found InquiBox.  "I was putting in all these long hours at
work, but I was not seeing the impact in relation to those hours. I'd
always felt really passionate about education - maybe because of the
background I come from - and I'd always wanted to do something in that
area. So, that's when I started thinking maybe I should do something on
my own.  "I started looking at all these startup events, meetups and
conferences. I spent about two years in management consulting,
essentially educating myself on how to launch a startup. So I was doing
these online courses, I was going and talking to people, attending
meetups, conferences, everything, essentially trying to understand how
it all works. "That was a lot of me learning the theory, but not yet
applying what I learned to my own startup. Essentially I wanted to
ensure I understood a little bit about what happens in the making of a
startup before I went ahead and did it."  The hardest part  "This might
sound really stupid, but the most surprising thing is how hard it is.
When I was working as a management consultant, I was working long hours
and thought I wasn't afraid of hard work. But once I started working on
InquiBox, I realised it's so much more than the number of hours you put
in. "Of course you need to work hard to make it happen. But, it's also a
battle of other factors. Is the market ready for your startup? You need
to find the right people for your team. You need to have the right
networks so people can give you support when you ask for it. I didn't
expect it to be so hard, and you only know how hard it is once you are
inside it.  "Pulling a team of people together to work on a startup who
are equally passionate about the mission as much as you are as a founder
is so difficult. "It's also very difficult to stay strong emotionally,
to be able to say, 'I don't even know what's going to happen in three or
six months time but I am still deciding to do it, I'll still keep going
with it, even though I don't know what the outcome will be'.  "So, it's
a lot about that inward journey as a startup founder, wherein you have
to keep faith in yourself repeatedly day in and day out. "Even when you
wake up really scared, you still have to go to work and keep working on
it, hoping that something will happen. That's the hardest thing.
"Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising, but I didn't understand it before
starting out. I think you can only understand it from the inside." 
Keeping people happy "The biggest difference between my experience in
corporates and leading a startup was that I had almost unlimited
resources to build a team at my corporate job, but very limited
resources to build a team as a startup founder. At my corporate job, I
had a way of keeping my team happy because I had all these resources.
But when you are a startup founder, you have to find other ways of
keeping people motivated, keeping people feeling passionate about the
mission. "It's important to show up as the kind of leader who believes
in the mission, who is present for the team, who wants to develop the
team even though you can't pay them that much. There are other ways in
which you can find fulfilment for your team and essentially lead them
effectively. "So you learn a lot more about leadership becoming a
startup founder, in terms of how can you influence and motivate people.
But this makes you introspect a lot on how you are interacting with
people, how you are being present for them and how you are finding ways
of helping them out even though you can't pay them a huge salary. "It
involved a lot of introspection and that's why I decided to take steps
in improving myself."  Startups in theory and practice  "The formal
learning experiences I had through accelerator programs were very good
in terms of making me comfortable with the life-cycle a startup goes
through. Exposing me to the principles of lean startup, how to analyse
data using lean analytics, and how to measure how your startup is
performing. Those things were definitely useful. "Actually, what really
helps is taking that fear away from the startup lingo. So if someone
says these words to you, you know what they are talking about. That's
definitely helpful.  "But I think one of the most difficult and strange
parts of this journey was how I was using that in my own startup and
quickly realising that our formal education is really theoretical
knowledge, but it's only when you apply it in a startup that you realise
things don't exactly go that way. So there are always surprises
happening and we essentially have to solve challenges every single
day."  Success is a learning process  "When I started I was finding it
very hard to effectively manage the new kind of stress. When I quit my
corporate job, one of the hardest things was to come to terms with my
identity. 'If I'm no longer a management consultant then what am I? How
do I define success in my life?' That was one of the hardest things for
me to grapple with. "So I put a lot of pressure on my startup to
actually succeed, even though everybody told me the statistics were
against me. So I was in this weird headspace. 'If my startup doesn't
succeed, what does that mean about me? Does that mean I'm a failure?
What does this mean for my identity?' "But over the course of the last
year, we launched and we have paying customers and now I feel okay. At
least we have a product that people want and now I'm placing a lot more
focus on my own learning. I feel that at least we did something
interesting, something that people are actually paying money for. "After
this realisation, my entire focus has changed from whether it's a
success or a failure more towards what can I learn through this process,
what I can learn about myself, about being a leader, about actually

ABSTRACT

Hima Tk had a successful career in management consulting before
realising she needed to do something more challenging and impactful.

FULL TEXT

Parents have it hard already, without the added problem of finding ways
to extend their children's education. That's why Hima Tk founded
InquiBox, a subscription service that delivers a package full of
play-based, STEM education activities for kids every month. Born in
India, she had a successful career in management consulting before
realising she needed to do something more challenging and impactful.
Through accelerator programs and a lot of hard work, she's learnt how to
be a startup founder. Starting with STEM  "InquiBox designs and delivers
educational activity subscription boxes for children aged 7 to 12 years
old, so they can learn through play," Hima Tk tells Duct Tape. "We
explore a different STEM topic in every box we send out. It's a
combination of a physical box and event platform, through which we
facilitate a tactile learning environment. "The problem we are trying to
solve is that modern parents know STEM education is important, but they
lack the tools, time and resources to make STEM engaging and fun for
children. So our product helps parents save time. They don't have to go
out and look for toys or games to make STEM learning easier for
children, we have packaged it up and sent it directly to the home so
that parents have the tools and resources ready for them, and children
can either play with them alone or with the parents.  "Although we've

play-based, STEM education activities for kids every month. Born in
India, she had a successful career in management consulting before
realising she needed to do something more challenging and impactful.
Through accelerator programs and a lot of hard work, she's learnt how to
be a startup founder. Starting with STEM  "InquiBox designs and delivers
educational activity subscription boxes for children aged 7 to 12 years
old, so they can learn through play," Hima Tk tells Duct Tape. "We
explore a different STEM topic in every box we send out. It's a
combination of a physical box and event platform, through which we
facilitate a tactile learning environment. "The problem we are trying to
solve is that modern parents know STEM education is important, but they
lack the tools, time and resources to make STEM engaging and fun for
children. So our product helps parents save time. They don't have to go
out and look for toys or games to make STEM learning easier for
children, we have packaged it up and sent it directly to the home so
that parents have the tools and resources ready for them, and children
can either play with them alone or with the parents.  "Although we've
been going for 18 months, we just officially launched the product and
started generating revenue about three months ago. At the moment we have
about 50 subscribers across Australia, but we have some ambitious growth
targets."  Leaving corporate life behind  "I was working as a management
consultant in Australia until, one and a half years back now, I decided
to leave and found InquiBox.  "I was putting in all these long hours at
work, but I was not seeing the impact in relation to those hours. I'd
always felt really passionate about education - maybe because of the
background I come from - and I'd always wanted to do something in that
area. So, that's when I started thinking maybe I should do something on
my own.  "I started looking at all these startup events, meetups and
conferences. I spent about two years in management consulting,
essentially educating myself on how to launch a startup. So I was doing
these online courses, I was going and talking to people, attending
meetups, conferences, everything, essentially trying to understand how
it all works. "That was a lot of me learning the theory, but not yet
applying what I learned to my own startup. Essentially I wanted to
ensure I understood a little bit about what happens in the making of a
startup before I went ahead and did it."  The hardest part  "This might
sound really stupid, but the most surprising thing is how hard it is.
When I was working as a management consultant, I was working long hours
and thought I wasn't afraid of hard work. But once I started working on
InquiBox, I realised it's so much more than the number of hours you put
in. "Of course you need to work hard to make it happen. But, it's also a
battle of other factors. Is the market ready for your startup? You need
to find the right people for your team. You need to have the right
networks so people can give you support when you ask for it. I didn't
expect it to be so hard, and you only know how hard it is once you are
inside it.  "Pulling a team of people together to work on a startup who
are equally passionate about the mission as much as you are as a founder
is so difficult. "It's also very difficult to stay strong emotionally,
to be able to say, 'I don't even know what's going to happen in three or
six months time but I am still deciding to do it, I'll still keep going
with it, even though I don't know what the outcome will be'.  "So, it's
a lot about that inward journey as a startup founder, wherein you have
to keep faith in yourself repeatedly day in and day out. "Even when you
wake up really scared, you still have to go to work and keep working on
it, hoping that something will happen. That's the hardest thing.
"Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising, but I didn't understand it before
starting out. I think you can only understand it from the inside." 
Keeping people happy "The biggest difference between my experience in
corporates and leading a startup was that I had almost unlimited
resources to build a team at my corporate job, but very limited
resources to build a team as a startup founder. At my corporate job, I
had a way of keeping my team happy because I had all these resources.
But when you are a startup founder, you have to find other ways of
keeping people motivated, keeping people feeling passionate about the
mission. "It's important to show up as the kind of leader who believes
in the mission, who is present for the team, who wants to develop the
team even though you can't pay them that much. There are other ways in
which you can find fulfilment for your team and essentially lead them
effectively. "So you learn a lot more about leadership becoming a
startup founder, in terms of how can you influence and motivate people.
But this makes you introspect a lot on how you are interacting with
people, how you are being present for them and how you are finding ways
of helping them out even though you can't pay them a huge salary. "It
involved a lot of introspection and that's why I decided to take steps
in improving myself."  Startups in theory and practice  "The formal
learning experiences I had through accelerator programs were very good
in terms of making me comfortable with the life-cycle a startup goes
through. Exposing me to the principles of lean startup, how to analyse
data using lean analytics, and how to measure how your startup is
performing. Those things were definitely useful. "Actually, what really
helps is taking that fear away from the startup lingo. So if someone
says these words to you, you know what they are talking about. That's
definitely helpful.  "But I think one of the most difficult and strange
parts of this journey was how I was using that in my own startup and
quickly realising that our formal education is really theoretical
knowledge, but it's only when you apply it in a startup that you realise
things don't exactly go that way. So there are always surprises
happening and we essentially have to solve challenges every single
day."  Success is a learning process  "When I started I was finding it
very hard to effectively manage the new kind of stress. When I quit my
corporate job, one of the hardest things was to come to terms with my
identity. 'If I'm no longer a management consultant then what am I? How
do I define success in my life?' That was one of the hardest things for
me to grapple with. "So I put a lot of pressure on my startup to
actually succeed, even though everybody told me the statistics were
against me. So I was in this weird headspace. 'If my startup doesn't
succeed, what does that mean about me? Does that mean I'm a failure?
What does this mean for my identity?' "But over the course of the last
year, we launched and we have paying customers and now I feel okay. At
least we have a product that people want and now I'm placing a lot more
focus on my own learning. I feel that at least we did something
interesting, something that people are actually paying money for. "After
this realisation, my entire focus has changed from whether it's a
success or a failure more towards what can I learn through this process,
what I can learn about myself, about being a leader, about actually
growing a business. "Essentially I changed my perspective on what

My job is my party: Ekta Kapoor

Hindustan Times

Dateline: Mumbai

Body

Mumbai, May 14 -- She has had quite an eventful journey in the world of
showbiz. "I complete 23 years on August 24. It has been satisfying,
happy and even crazy rollercoaster ride," says Ekta Kapoor, laughing.
Although she is successfully balancing out her TV productions, films and
online shows, the producer admits that sometimes she does "feel
stretched" with all the work. But she isn't complaining. We catch up
with her about life, career and more.

You must be really kicked about the response to Veere Di Wedding
(VDW)...

I am like an ostrich (laughs). I put the work out and then I shut myself
because people will say a lot of things. Now, we are moving towards its
release, so we are all in the execution mode - from putting out the
promos, songs and new visuals.

At this stage, people have a lot of expectations from you. Do you feel
the burden of it?

Actually, I don't because I believe you can't start getting too tied up
with success and failure. Actually, my burdens are very different. For
example, my neck is hurting now, so I am worried ki kuch hua toh nahi
mujhe (laughs). I have learnt from my failures and I don't get
fascinated by success. After VDW, I will move on to Mental Hai Kya (with
Kangana Ranaut). So every time, I get in to a new project, I don't think
of the previous one.

But you have had quite a journey to create your own name and not just be
known as Jeetendra's daughter...

I believe my father had his own journey and I have had my own. Every
curse is a blessing and vice versa. I used to weigh 80 kilos when I was
younger, so no one would have launched me [as an actor]. I always
thought that my friends would do really well in life but I was never
jealous of them. Instead, I was happy. As for me, I used to think, 'I
will also do something. If I earn 25,000 a month, it will take care of
my food and partying and I would be very happy with life'. Then, I
stumbled upon TV production and I liked what I was doing. So, I
continued with it and life changed for me. I think it's a good thing
that I never became an actress.

Also, you seem to have always believed in breaking rules. Right?

My whole thing is, 'why limit ourselves'. At any point of time, if we
feel, 'yeh chalega nahi, then it's like we are listening to rules that
our industry forefathers set for us'. Every day, we get exposed to fresh
content, work in different mediums, and evolve more. We are becoming
smarter and evolving every day and so is the world, so why follow the
old rules? Sometimes, I do feel that I am a bit too stretched [for
time]. But I love my job. I get stressed only when I have to go to
parties or sit for interviews (laughs). I am the happiest when I do
creative work. My job is my party. I am getting a chance to live the
life of three different creators on three different mediums. TV is all
about family audience, and I am also busy with VDW, which are two
different worlds. Then, I am also sitting on something absolutely
distinct like Mental Hai Kya. Plus, there is also Gandi Baat (web
series). So I have an opportunity to explore my mind, and learn so much
from various people. Yes, multitasking is going to take a toll on you
and it does. But I think I am doing a fun job and I should be very
grateful.

Is your company's app the main focus now?

Our company is 75% about AltBalaji now. This is the first time that we
own a platform which is 'direct to customers'. We have a cartel show
coming up starring Vivek Oberoi, which will be like an ode to Shootout
At Lokhandwala (2007), Shootout At Wadala (2013), or Once Upon A Time in
Mumbai (2010). There is also Puncch Beat and Kehne Ko Humsafar Hai and
uber-cool shows like Bose and The Test Case. By 2020, there will be 660
million smartphones, and everyone will have their own taste [for
content]. There will no longer be 'one-size-fits-all kind of content'.
Just India needs to have 1,000 more shows for 660 million people, so
it's a big business.

What about films? At one point, you started to go slow with it?

It was in 2016 when we had six big back-to-back flops. But now, I am
back to making movies and I hope to make more. Of course, my main
business will be the company's app but I will make more movies. On June
1, I have VDW's release and the next day, Naagin 3 launches. Then, on
Monday, I launch my family soap followed by another show. So in 10 days,
I have four launches all on different mediums.

Conscience Consumerism – Food for Thought from the Social Enterprise

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, 12 December 2019, -/African Media Agency
(AMA)/- The rise of social entrepreneurship is a topic that either
excites you-or one you glance over because of a failure to understand
its role and socioeconomic impact. Either way, we’re here to provide
some insights based on our experience at the Social Enterprise World
Forum.

Firstly, it is important not to confuse social entrepreneurship with
charity – social enterprises are for-profit businesses that focus on
solving social issues, or provide goods and services like any another
business, but offer impact beyond financial success. The thing that all
social enterprises have in common, is that they reinvest the majority of
their profits in support of a social or environmental cause and play a
crucial role in uplifting marginalized communities. And while there is
great traction in social entrepreneurship across the globe, there is
still much to do: “Success should not be measured on what we have
achieved, but on what we still have left to accomplish,” acknowledges
James Okina,   Street Priests Inc.

If you think only millennials and Gen Z support brands associated with
societal impact, think again. Across the globe, there is a mindful
movement of consumers and prospective employees who are becoming
increasingly interested in engaging with businesses that support worthy
causes and that understand the role they play in solving societal
issues.

In October 2019, more than 1,200 social enterprises, activists,
politicians, and advocates from 70 countries gathered in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia for the twelfth annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF).
Among them, SAP hosted 48 entrepreneurs from across the world in support
of connecting global innovators and growing the social entrepreneurship
movement. Here are our top 5 takeaways from the Social Enterprise World
Forum that we believe others can learn from:

1. Economics first:

“Don’t get so caught up in your passion that you forget to build a
viable business.”

– Melat Yosef, Vitabite.

Through various testimonies delivered at SEWF2019, it is clear that many
social enterprise startups fail. In fact, startup failure rates range
from 80-90%. Sometimes, barriers to market outnumber opportunities to
market. Sometimes failure is purely as a result of the additional layer
of complexity, namely societal impact.

As a social entrepreneur, your situation might be that capital is
limited – both human and cashflow. The demand for your offering is
abundant and the community need is high. Ask yourself: As a social
enterprise, should you first focus on commercial viability and revenue
so that you can deliver greater impact in support of your purpose? Or –
should you instead focus on delivering on your promise of societal
impact that, in turn, will attract and retain customers?

This chicken and egg scenario was highly debated at the Forum. In our
minds, there is a clear winner in the argument. As a social
entrepreneur, you must always offer superior products and/or services to
lead the market. Holding the designation of social enterprise or
entrepreneur doesn’t mean you can offer substandard offerings. Customers
demand excellence regardless of the social element of this endeavor.
“Keep your standards high and your costs low,” asserted Nikki Germany,
Chief Growth Officer of e-commerce provider Copia.

Tenacity is key to survival. Various of the social entrepreneurs we
spoke to, testified that they were only successful at their second or
third attempt in establishing their business. If you’re part of the
majority whose organization has failed, Bernard Kirk, Founder and CEO of
The Camden Education Trust urges you not to give up. “You might fail
now, but that will lead to success later on down the road.”

2. The Call for Capacity-building

“Most people and organizations got their start with one big break. Can
you play a role in creating someone else’s one big break?” – Cathy
Smith, Managing Director, SAP Africa

According to the United Nations (UN), Africa’s population will double by
2050, with Sub-Saharan Africa making up as much as a quarter of the
world’s population. More than half of the estimated 2.4 billion people
will be under the age of 25 – and without education, training, or
employment. This problem is not isolated to Africa, but rather an
opportunity for the world to sustainably integrate a large population of
changemakers into the global economy. While governments may be
responsible for creating the right conditions and legislation to address
the UN’s   Sustainable Development Goals, business is in a unique
position to help.

The concept of building capacity simply means one organization helping
another to operate better, expanding their capabilities. In the case of
SAP, for example, we have sent more than 1000 SAP employees to more than
350 organizations worldwide through the SAP Social Sabbatical to help
social enterprises and non-profits overcome strategic business
challenges. As of 2018, this global pro bono program implemented by
PYXERA Global has delivered an in-kind contribution of €15.8M and
279,000 service hours, impacting 4.9M lives. Specifically, organizations
like DreamOval Foundation in Ghana reported a 100% growth in its ICT
education following a Social Sabbatical engagement which sparked the
introduction of a new program, Females in Tech Initiatives (   FemiTI).

The question remains – how do we build capacity at scale? How do we use
technology platforms, skilled talent and access to markets to create
that one big break for organizations to succeed? Every sector-private,
public, and social-has a role to play in creating a chain reaction of
big breaks. What role will you play?

3. Partnership:

These types of partnerships or opportunities to collaborate are
essential to our work. Without them, we simply would not be able to
deliver on our mandate.” – Francis Ahene-Affoh, DreamOval Foundation

There is complexity in the problems we are trying to solve. They are all
interconnected. We can’t solve a problem like quality education without
understanding poverty, food scarcity and gender equality, to name a few.
“We’re standing on a burning platform and it’s triangular,” shared Lord
Victor Adebowale, Chairman of Social Enterprise UK board.

“The community has to create a common understanding of our brand, and
our brand is about understanding society,” Adebowale adds. “We also need
a credible economic model.” Although social enterprise plays a role,
based on the sector’s best practices, “it can drag the rest of business
into the future. Lastly, we can’t expect politicians to understand or
care about this movement. We just need to understand why they don’t. We
have to talk to people that don’t agree with us -otherwise we are
working in an echo chamber.”

We must partner across the global social entrepreneurship sector, and
across all sectors (public, private and social) to create change. Simply
connecting the dots can have a massive impact.

4. Scale:

“We see corporates playing a greater role in social enterprise. This is
the future. Responsible growth of corporate companies is the driving
force that can generate more entrepreneurs, generate more jobs, and
generate much more movement in society.” – Dr. Ephrem Tekle Lemango,
Commissioner at Jobs Creation Commission, Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia, FDRE

When you gather over 1000 players from the sector worldwide, it becomes
very evident that organizations are at varying stages of maturity. In
addition to capacity building, if we want ‘to create real socioeconomic
impact, we need to invest in scalable solutions globally,’ affirms Yves
Moury, founder and CEO of FundaciÃ³n Capital. “The key to scalable
solutions is tech, tech, tech!”

One way technology can help, is through corporate procurement. All
social enterprises rely on markets to drive revenues that enable them to
create social impact. “Remember, social enterprise is a verb
representing business trying to deliver social value,” shares Jonathan
Coburn, Managing Director, Social Enterprise Institute. “We need to open
markets for activity to happen, creating an open social value
marketplace. Suppliers offer the social value. Buyers use purchasing to
create healthy communities.” There is a US$3 trillion B2B revenue
opportunity ripe for social enterprises to tap into.

However, technology isn’t the silver bullet. You must consider
supply-side capability which scales both ways. An enterprise can’t
produce more than the market demands. Vice versa, an enterprise
shouldn’t be limited if it gets its big break. Ultimately, technology
remains a key enabler to scale though.

Visionary James Okina says you must ask yourself one question: ‘How do
you scale hope?’ Our response: together.

5. Cultural identity and progress:

“We’re engraining local traditions with fresh perspectives.” – Gerry
Higgins, Founder, Social Enterprise World Forum

“There is a phrase ‘Laptops and Lederhosen’ coined by a German
politician,” offered Ludwig Bayern, Founder and CEO, Learning Lions. Its
meaning, not dissimilar from the Forum’s theme, “underscores that
cultural identity and being on the forefront of innovation can go hand
in hand.” This topic hits home for Bayern who, like many entrepreneurs,
looks for ways to foster economic growth in underserved, remote
populations without disrupting what makes these rural communities
unique.

“Living in a remote location like Turkana, Kenya, where we operate, does
not mean there is a lack of internet connectivity,” added Bayern.
“People there are completely connected to the web via mobile phones, and
yet they are not connected to the global workforce infrastructure.”
Mobile and cloud technology can connect people to global markets that
need their skills.

“In India, 70% of the population live in rural areas,” adds Deirdre
White, CEO, PYXERA Global. “The biggest sectors include agriculture and
artisan work. We must continue to support manual efforts and artisans
and use technology to help these individuals scale by giving them access
to new markets.” Social entrepreneurs should also embrace technology as
their enabler to be change agents and create new markets. Yash Ranga of
Jaipur Rugs agrees. “Technology isn’t about changing the industries
people are in, but rather about empowering them to move up the value
chain by gaining access to a broader market of consumers.” Jaipur Rugs
started in a tiny village in Rajasthan, India, and is now known the
world over for its inclusive carpet value chain that links grassroots
artisans with global markets.

Urbanization is not the answer. Using technology infrastructure and
building digital skills to connect people wherever they are to global
markets, is.

The road to 2030

“SAP can lead the way by bringing other corporations along with us,”
said Alexandra van der Ploeg, Global Head of SAP Corporate Social
Responsibility. “The world is looking to technology to help create
sustainable solutions that help the world run better and improve
people’s lives. While technology cannot replace culture, capacity
building, and partnership, it can definitely accelerate impact.”

You don’t have to be a social entrepreneur to practice social
entrepreneurship. You need only understand the realities of the world we
live in. Find time to listen. Find champions who are already engaging on
the ground. There is so much change that can happen if individuals,
organizations and governments come together to identify solutions and
put them into practice together. “None of us will ever truly know the
entire circumstances of the people we are trying to help,” shared Amonge
Sinxoto, Founder of Blackboard Africa, “-but we must still engage.”

We look forward to seeing you, alongside SAP and our partner ecosystem,
at the next Social Enterprise World Forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia. There
is still a lot left to do.

This insightful feature from YourStory tests and strengthens your
business acumen! Here are 5 questions to kick off this 22nd quiz. Ready?

This weekly quiz from YourStory tests your domain knowledge, business
acumen, and lateral thinking skills (see the previous edition here). In
this 22nd edition of the quiz, we present issues tackled by real-life
entrepreneurs in their startup journeys.

What would you do if you were in their shoes? At the end of the quiz,
you will find out what the entrepreneurs themselves actually did. Would
you do things differently?

Check out YourStory's Book Review section as well, with takeaways from
over 325 titles on creativity and entrepreneurship, and our weekend
PhotoSparks section on creativity in the arts.

Q1: Product-market fit

Founder passion and customer empathy are great ways to get started on
solving a problem. Evolving from MVP (minimum viable product) to a
scaled portfolio are other milestones in the journey. But what are other
success factors beyond getting satisfied customers?

Q2: The innovation pathway

Investing in R&D, improving employee creativity, and promoting
intrapreneurs are proven ways to increase a firm's innovation quotient.
Externally, mergers and acquisitions are other ways to acquire new IP,
talent, and market share. What's another powerful approach to
innovation?

Q3: Online healthcare

Online healthcare received a tremendous boost during the pandemic for
virtual consultations, medicine delivery, and at-home workouts during
the lockdowns. It reduces risk and increases productivity as well. What
are other advantages of online healthcare?

Q4: Digital branding

Tapping social media influencers can be an effective way to increase
brand visibility. Becoming an influencer is even better. There are
multiple channels available now to publish and promote a company's
content, ranging from email newsletters to immersive media. But one
foundational media space is often overlooked - what is it?

Q5: Fundraising

"Friends, family, and fools" is the most direct way to raise external
funding for an entrepreneur. Angel investors, VCs, and crowdfunding are
the next obvious sources, along with grants or investments from
incubators, accelerators, and government schemes. What's another
fast-emerging source of funding for startups?

Answers!

Congratulations on having come this far! But there's more to come -
answers to these five questions (below) and links to articles with more
details on the entrepreneurs' solutions. Happy reading, happy learning,
and happy creating!

A1: Product-market fit

"Paying and repeat customers are the best indicators of a product-market
fit that is working," explains Shreyans Daga, CTO of MyGate. The product
must solve a real problem, and the market should be large enough to
offer the potential of scale.

"Entrepreneurs are often extremely passionate about their ideas, which
may not be the case with their customers," Shreyans cautions. One of the
leading causes of startup failure is the lack of market need and the
inability of the founders to pivot to a new product. Read more on
product-market fit here.

A2: The innovation pathway

"Open innovation is the future," explains Rajiv Mukherjee, Co-founder of
IncubateHub. The firm connects corporates to a curated community of
startups and facilitates the creation of prototypes and solutions.

The corporate innovation market is expected to reach $750 million by
2023, according to Rajiv. Read more here about the growing popularity of
the open innovation model thanks to its advantages of synergy, lower
cost of experimentation, and competitive advantage through new revenue
streams.

A3: Online healthcare

"One of the many benefits of the internet is that this medium makes
mental healthcare more approachable while also being readily
accessible," explains Rakesh Sharma, Director, AtEase. In the pandemic
era, online platforms have provided private and confidential access to
counsellors to deal with stress.

Rakesh also showcases the importance and advantages of online mental
health platforms for women and LGBTQIA+ communities. "Online mental
health platforms do not restrict you to a particular geographical
radius, allowing you to connect with licensed medical practitioners from
all over the country or globe," he adds. Read more about online mental
healthcare here.

A4: Digital branding

"Every other space has its own rules and regulations, but a website is a
timeless artefact that people can always visit," explains Ajit Sivaram,
co-founder of U&I. The charitable organisation works towards providing
non-formal education to children.

In spite of all the social media craze, websites play a huge role in
establishing a brand presence, according to Ajith. "We can organise the
data we want, show it the way we want, so I think it's the best way to
portray your brand," he adds. Read more about the website advantage
here.

A5: Fundraising

"Today there is a lot more opportunity to raise capital from the HNIs
and family offices," explains Adith Podhar, founder of Gemba Capital, a
micro VC fund. Over the past few years, many family offices have become
keen to invest in entrepreneurs.

It is usually the younger generation of these families that take the
lead, thanks to exposure to the startup boom. The buoyancy of the
startup ecosystem in India is attracting a new breed of investors. Read
more of such investor trends here.

Filing glitches on MCA even as deadline nears

Bengaluru: “We are facing a very difficult situation with the changes in
MCA21,” a Kolkata-based company secretary (CS) said even as the deadline
to complete filing of several corporate forms nears. Chartered
accountants (CAs) and CS TOIspoke to said that that these glitches have
been going on for one year, which was when the transition to the new
version of the corporate affairs ministry's website began. All forms
other than annual returns have been affected.

These include forms like DPT3, where the company is supposed to declare
loan and outstanding balance. This was introduced a few years ago. Some
other forms are related to allocation of share capital and details of
any loans taken from banks. Jigar Shah, partner in JMJA & Associates
LLP, said more people are feeling the pain now because the changes are
applicable for all compani- es. The corporate affairs ministry had begun
the transition with limited liability partnership firms (LLPs) when it
began last year. “The major problem is that we are not able to submit
forms. We are getting suggestions like 'go incognito' and 'change
password' if we want to file our documents. To add to the trouble, when
there are failures, startups and companies are asked to pay additional
fees, and use of our funds are restricted till forms are filed,” Shah
told TOI. Many professionals have been giving each other advice like
clearing the cache, signing out and signing in again, if they are not
able to fill the form. These glitches have resulted in a Twitter trend
with the hashtag #V3errors. Company secretaries are using the
microblogging site to highlight their concerns. One CA tweeted that he
had raised his complaint on March 16 and, even on March 24, his issues
were not looked into. IT firm LTIMindtree has been managing the website
through the transition. This is not the first time a government portal
is making the news for glitches. LTIMindtree, in a statement, said that
users must adapt fully to the changes on the portal for seamless filing.
It also went on to say that the portal is working fine. “Even the
process of digital signatures of the forms has undergone a change and
now only users who are registered on the system post KYC, are allowed to
sign forms, to ensure traceability,” the company said.

Proteas' mountain to climb

Hindustan Times Jammu & Kashmir

September 12, 2019 Thursday

Copyright 2019 HT Digital streams Ltd All Rights Reserved

Length: 832 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Sept. 12 -- January 2018. South Africa's then head coach,
Ottis Gibson, launched a grand 'Vision 2019', a master plan to break the
Proteas' choking streak at the World Cup.

August 2019. Gibson and his entire coaching team got the boot by Cricket
South Africa (CSA). Only three wins in nine matches in England had left
the 'vision' somewhat blurred.

Gibson's blueprint for succeeding involved experimentation and rotation,
all leading up to the big prize. It never came. Retirements, tightly
packed bilateral ODI series leading to fatigue and an injury-list that
kept getting longer right into the World Cup meant that the Proteas
finished seventh-only above Bangladesh, West Indies and Afghanistan.

"We only had 18 months, probably less than 18 months to build a team, so
time was always against us," Gibson would go on to say after the exit.

In less than 18 months, South Africa will go into another ICC event -
the World T20 in Australia, a tournament where they have reached the
semi-finals on two occasions. Shaking away the disappointment of the
bygone World Cup campaign and rebuilding in time for the World T20 is
their big challenge. The journey won't be easy but it offers redemption
too.

The first step on the long road to the World T20 will be taken on Sunday
in Dharamsala, where the three-match T20 series against India begins.
This is South Africa's first assignment post the World Cup meltdown and,
understandably, the squad bears a fresh look.

The last time South Africa toured this part of the world for a T20
series in 2015-16, they prevailed 2-0. Only fast bowler Kagiso Rabada
remains from that squad for the upcoming series. According to SA's
interim team-director Enoch Nkwe, South Africa have already begun wiping
the slate, starting with Quinton de Kock replacing the experienced Faf
du Plessis as captain in T20Is.

"It's also an opportunity to start building for the future. We know
where Faf stands, as a captain and as a player. He's done great things
for South African cricket. We also need to look at what the future looks
like. We believe in Quinton, who's going to be leading the team in this
series," Nkwe, the coach-cum-manager, said during his first press meet
in Dharamsala.

"The T20 series gives us the last chance to have a look at our
leadership and batting options as the next edition of the T20 World Cup
is now little more than a year away, which is why we have gone with an
inexperienced leadership group," Corrie van Zyl, CSA's acting director
of cricket, had said before the team's departure.

For de Kock, who came into the limelight with three successive ODI tons
against India at home in 2013, his promotion to the captain's post is a
gradual progression of a player who was primed to be major force in the
South African line-up.

At the World Cup, he was one of the three South African batsmen, along
with du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen, to tally more than 300 runs
and yet it was his failure to convert his starts into big scores that
ended up hurting South Africa.

"Coming into this series, we've got a lot of new players. Win or lose, I
just want the guys to keep competing, keep fighting. As long as they
keep doing that, I'm sure we'll be in good hands," said de Kock.

"We've got quite a young team, so there will be a lot of energy. I'm
looking forward to that." Of course he is, given he struck two centuries
and 318 runs the last time South Africa played an ODI series in India,
back in 2015-16.

Not everyone who failed in England and Wales has been ignored. The South
Africans have included eight players from the World Cup squad in the
14-man T20 unit for the India tour.

Seven of those eight are returning from a period away from cricket,
while only Beuran Hendricks featured in an A-series. Aiden Markram and
Lungi Ngidi, both of whom starred in the Test series when India toured
South Africa in 2018, will feature in the long-format leg of this tour,
starting in Visakhapatnam early next month.

The squad features four T20 debutants in batsman Temba Bavuma, left-arm
spinner Bjorn Fortuin, allrounder George Linde and fast bowler Anrich
Nortje. All four were part of the South Africa A side that played in the
recently-concluded one-day series against India A. Three other members
from that A side are in the T20 side.

And it is not only the T20s that will see players earning international
caps. The Test squad has a possible debutant in Nortje, wicketkeeper
Rudi Second and spinning allrounder Senuran Muthusamy.

"We're looking to invest in a good foundation going into the T20 World
Cup next year in Australia. But we still have a lot of games. We have
about 20 games. So we'll reassess the situation after these three games
against India and see where we're at. For now, the focus is this
upcoming series," Nkwe said.

Tip to make your Ecommerce Business Model Successful

YRC is a Management Consulting Company, especially for the B-C Sector.
Empowering Retail & E-commerce businesses." — Nikhil AgarwalDUBAI,
DUBAI, DUBAI, August 16, 2022 /EINPresswire.com / -- For a startup to
avoid failure of your ecommerce business model , adopting either Blue
Ocean and Red Ocean technique does not require a lot of anxiety as it
depends on your chance and just how healthy you perform it.

What's the Red Ocean Strategy?

A focused marketplace can be extremely competitive in a red marine
market or maybe a red maritime strategy. These are typically found by
the little but unpopular market. In a red marine market, the competitors
would usually be significant, and the existing businesses compete with
one another using naturally competitive methods.

A red ocean market is extremely competitive and could be riskier for a
brand-new company, particularly a startup. Among the examples associated
with a red ocean, the company could be various car companies. Each of
the different businesses is fighting with one another to resolve the
very same issue or maybe the need faced by the customers.

Red-colored Ocean Strategy Examples

Apple

Apple launched its iPhone in 2007 when companies such as Nokia,
Motorola, and Sony dominated the industry. Apple needed to produce a
user base where users were prepared to spend 1dolar1 600 holding a
telephone. How did apple disrupt the market? They made a better
smartphone than its competitors, which we are all aware of these days as
the iPhone 2g.

5 Guys

5 Guys is an American fast restaurant chain founded in 1986. 5 Guys was
planning to enter the fast-food market in which its KFC, McDonald, and
competitors dominated the industry. Just how did it allow it to be huge
in a very competitive market? Among the causes was it did not spend
millions on marketing and presented burgers that were good with better
quality. It's currently one of the best fast-food chains in America.

Red-colored Ocean Strategy Examples in India

Spruce Jet

SpiceJet is a pathetic illustration of a Red Ocean business in India;
SpiceJet is a low-cost airline that has acquired clients by providing
solutions much smaller than its competitors, though it's constantly in
immediate competition with other businesses.

Jio

As Jio entered the marketplace, it made a disturbance through free
services, which disrupted the entire telecom industry.

What's the Blue Ocean Strategy?

A blue ocean strategy is concentrated even more on the customers' brand
new demands and trends in developing a brand new industry based on it.
Blue oceans are a much more unoccupied market and never much known. The
blue ocean market mainly concentrates on providing value and is created
based on which.

Blue Ocean Strategy Examples

Uber

Uber is a terrific illustration of the Blue Ocean strategy. It solved
one of many main issues of the customers while booking cabs that had
been a denial of services, meter problems, and unwanted arguments.

Airbnb is an internet marketplace that acts as a mediator for those who
need to rent out their homes to individuals searching for accommodation
locations. Airbnb eliminated the issues of travelers in discovering a
hotel with quality service. Airbnb is among the best businesses in the
lodging market, with revenue of 11 3.4 billion in 2020.

Blue Ocean Strategy Examples in India

Oyo Rooms

Oyo Rooms is a hotel chain created via Ritesh Agarwal. Oyo Rooms moved
into a new market, budget hospitality. It solved the issues of consumers
searching for a good hotel at an inexpensive cost.

Conclusion

At any rate, the process Red Ocean is much more on the off chance that
you have the choice to create the image of yours even handier for the
customer and just how great you promote the product of yours, assuming
your product or service, for instance, say, is of FMCG ( )
classification Red Ocean Strategy will probably be utilized. Your Retail
Coach (YRC), a company that specializes in eCommerce and outsourced
retail , offers a variety of offline and online retail solutions .

The six components of creativity, and how to make your organisation an
innovation engine

Yourstory.in

April 18, 2019 Thursday 6:30 AM EST

Knowledge, imagination, attitude, resources, habitat, and culture are
the key factors for entrepreneurial success. Here's how to weave them
together in your organisation and build momentum for innovation.

Creativity need not come only from external inspiration, divine
intervention, magical help, or even muses. It is the natural result of a
clear set of processes and conditions, according to Tina Seelig's book,
inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity. The title of the book is drawn
from the Latin word ingenium, which means natural capacity or innate
talent.

Tina Seelig is a Professor of the Practice in the Department of
Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, and the
Faculty Director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program (STVP). She
teaches creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship at the d.school at
Stanford University. She earned her PhD in neuroscience from Stanford
Medical School, and has worked as a management consultant, software
producer, and entrepreneur. Her other books include What I Wish I Knew
When I Was 20, Insight Out, and Creativity Rules.

"Creativity allows you to thrive in an ever-changing world and unlocks a
universe of possibilities," Tina begins. Ideas aren't cheap, they are
valuable. Ideas are the "cranes that pull us out of well-worn ruts", and
push us ahead to progress. The results of creativity are in objects all
around us, from alarm clocks to zippers ('A to Z').

The 11 chapters are spread across 216 pages, and make for an
entertaining and informative read. Here are my key takeaways from the
book. You can also read my book reviews of related titles The Creative
Curve,How to Get to Great Ideas,The Other Ideas,Ideas are Your Only
Currency,Show Your Work, and The Innovative Mindset.

Tina proposes a creativity model called the Innovation Engine (see
Figure 1 below). The internal components are knowledge (fuel),
imagination (transforming knowledge into ideas), and attitude (spark).
The external components are resources (community assets), habitats
(environments: work, home), and culture (beliefs, values, behaviours).

Creativity can be taught through workshops, case studies, field trips,
games, expert talks, and inter-disciplinary teamwork. People can be
taught techniques to observe better, connect ideas, challenge
assumptions, suspend premature judgment, and reframe problems.

1. Framing

"Reframing problems takes effort, attention and practice," Tina
explains. It challenges current points of view and introduces new
perspectives. Interview techniques can then sharpen the art of listening
deeper and digging for underlying factors through 'why' questions.

Netflix framed its business as movie delivery, not just DVD delivery.
Amazon framed its book business not just for print books but electronic
books as well. Scott Summit, Founder of Bespoke, framed prosthetics as
not just unsightly artificial limbs but custom-made fashion accessories.

Flash restaurants or pop-up restaurants are more like theatre
performances. Tesco framed the shopping task differently by bringing the
store to busy Korean commuters; displaying aisles and products in train
stations helped item purchases via QR codes.

San Francisco Unified School District presents history as a
participatory activity of interpreting old maps, documents, and letters,
thus helping students draw out different connections and
interpretations. This made students more investigative, engaged,
enthusiastic, and critical thinkers.

"Everything is ripe for innovation," Tina explains. For example, an
exercise for re-designing of name tags expanded to designing
colour-coded bracelets, and even custom T-shirts with information and
pictures about sports, hobbies, and places visited. Getting people to
form a line in ascending order of their birthdays without talking can be
done by using sign language, showing ID cards, singing out the dates,
writing them on individual pieces of paper, or drawing a timeline on the
ground.

Photography is a great way to learn the importance and art of framing,
filtering, perspective, and level of detail. Examples from the art world
include MC Escher's graphic art (e.g. birds fading into fishes).
Composer John Cage's piece called 4'33" requires the performers to sit
quietly and not play anything for four minutes and thirty-three
seconds - concentrating instead on the sounds in the theatre hall.

2. Connections and combinations

Silicon Valley is a great place for creativity due to its cultural
diversity and informal communication networks and spaces, as documented
by Annalee Saxenian in her book, Regional Advantage. Public forums and
informal mixers lubricate the flow of ideas, with cross-pollination
across different fields.

Similarly, Lima in Peru has emerged as a hub of fascinating food
fusions. Art flourishes in crossroads cities such as Istanbul, Hong
Kong, London, and New York. Painters, musicians, and writers build on
each other's ideas. Talking to people during travel trips can also spark
off interesting conversations and connections.

Elizabeth Weil, head of organisational culture at Twitter, hires people
who are not only skilled for the jobs but are also interested in
unrelated pursuits. This helps trigger random conversations and new
ideas. Mir Imran, Founder of InCube Labs, combines insights across
professional disciplines and personal experiences.

The New Yorker magazine has caption contests for cartoons, and forces
readers to come up with humorous connections. Edinburgh College of Art
encourages students to combine household items into new edgy objects,
e.g. sex toys.

Tina encourages students to combine two household objects and come up
with alternative unintended uses, e.g. using lipstick and nail polish to
paint figures. A Japanese student combined an alarm clock with
flashcards so that it could only be turned off by answering the quiz
correctly. Elsewhere, discarded items have been converted into art, e.g.
dresses from candy wrappers.

The Japanese art of chindogu involves unusual combinations of products,
such as a belly mop worn by a baby (the floor is cleaned while
crawling), a shirt with a matrix on the back (so you can specify where
you want to be scratched), and eyeglass arms that can be removed (and
used as chopsticks).

3. Idea generation and brainstorming

When faced with a problem, people often stick to the first possible
solution, even though it may not be the best. It takes a concerted
effort to keep pushing past to new ideas. Formal methods like TRIZ help
combine different types of attributes and components into new products.

Other creative methods draw on emotions, such as writing poetry or
making a music video. Some scientists have even tried to define
'Creativity Quotient' (CQ) based on the number and diversity of
responses to questions like how many things can be done with a clip,
brick, or paper.

Done well, brainstorming can be useful if it draws on principles like
generate lots of ideas, encourage unusual ideas, defer judgment in the
exploration phase, and combine ideas. Such approaches have been used
during sessions for transforming engineering education curriculum in the
US.

Questions should be framed in a provocative manner, and should be
neither too broad not too specific. Word games help warm up the crowd.
The space for the session should be fluid, with lots of writing space
and materials for prototyping. There should be groups of small and
diverse teams, including engineers, designers, sales staff, end users,
and influencers. People should be able to walk around a lot, and
encouraged to do so.

Removing the early obvious solutions push participants to come up with
something new. Outcomes can first be described on sticky notes in short
phrases and even newspaper headlines, rather than business plans. They
can be moved around as clusters and patterns emerge. Mindmapping is
another useful visualisation technique.

The overall session should last from 15 minutes to an hour. Finally, the
ideas should be clustered, ranked, and rated as per a number of criteria
(eg. impact, cost, speed), and annotated with comments.

4. Focused observation

"Acute observation is a key skill for gaining valuable knowledge about
the world around you," Tina emphasises. "Need finding" is an important
activity for entrepreneurs. A keen sense of observation is needed to see
things right under our nose or beyond eye level, or which we overlook in
the rush of daily activity.

Customer feedback gives valuable clues about product positioning and
pricing, according to serial entrepreneur Steve Blank. Observing clues
from bike rental shacks gave David Friedberg valuable insights about the
importance of weather data; he went on to found the Climate Corporation.
Magicians and illusionists are masters of distraction and manipulation.

"Scientists and artists of all types are the world's 'noticers'. They
are trained to pay attention and to communicate what they see and
experience to the rest of us," Tina explains. Examples include Charles
Darwin, and today's Stanford Safari for microbiology students.

"True observation is a very active experience," Tina says; it involves
continuous engagement, layered details, and extensive note-taking in
multimedia forms. In a shopping centre, this can involve noting down
details of entrances, environment, sounds, aromas, personnel, products,
customers, and activities.

Art is not just about technique but internalising observations and
expressing them in different media. Choreographer Twyla Tharp prepares
boxes of artefacts for each project; the very process of preparing them
is like commitment to the project.

IDEO observed blood donor reactions and asked them to write a short
story of why they give blood, along with their photos. This became a
popular feature on the Red Cross website. Medical breakthroughs by Mir
Imran come from detecting patterns as well as inconsistencies in medical
treatments for fibrillation; this requires switching back and forth from
different perspectives.

"Focused observation is a powerful way to acquire valuable knowledge
about the world. That knowledge is the starting point for all your
creative endeavours because it provides rich fuel for your imagination,"
Tina explains.

5. Workspace

"Creative spaces lead to creative work," writes the author, pointing to
Pixar's rich and provocative environment as an example. "Many startup
companies adopt this philosophy," she adds; Scribd has a playful office
design with a go-cart game they called "scracing". Square, on the other
hand, has a simple and open office design.

"Space is the stage on which we play out our lives. If you want to be
creative, you need to build physical habitats that unlock your
imagination," Tina emphasises. Creative spaces should invite
conversation and collaboration; increasing such energy is not a
frivolous issue.

Office design, window views, ambient sound, flexible configurations, and
work artefacts can create stimulating experiences. While children have
creative playrooms and classrooms, these spaces unfortunately get less
and less inspiring in college and corporate offices.

Learning expert Ewan McIntosh defines a range of working spaces: private
spaces, group spaces, publishing spaces, performing spaces,
participation spaces, watching spaces, and even data spaces. Each has
different implications for reflection, communication, expression, and
observation.

Architects tend to have stunning offices; Jeanne Gang has artefacts and
artworks from around the world, and three different spaces for
workshops, prototyping, and presentations. The d.School has furniture
that can be moved around, stacked, and reassembled. This improves team
dynamics and creativity, as experiments in space design showed.

At IDEO, employees keep rearranging their space. Scenic views in
hospitals can help patients recover faster; ambient music can change the
perception of wine and food.

6. Constraints and pressure

Constraints can stimulate creativity. As explained by Teresa Amabile,
pressure affects creativity in a number of ways. High pressure and
creativity lead to a sense of mission (e.g. rescuing the Apollo 13
astronauts), whereas low pressure and creativity lead to a feeling of
being on autopilot. Other variations lead to treadmill or expedition
conditions.

Most startups operate under conditions of constraint, which can actually
be a catalyst for creativity, Tina explains. The constraints are of team
size, time, and revenues. Opposite approaches can also help frame
problems differently, as in the case of Amazon making free shipping
possible (no financial constraints, but enabled by large volumes of
sales).

Twitter is a good example of creative expression under fixed character
limits. SMITH magazine extended Ernest Hemingway's memoir written in
only six words; this was opened up on its website, and the collection
went on to become a bestselling book. Tina asks her students to
introduce themselves to each other in six words each.

Oxford University's All Soul's College has a "one-word essay" as an
entry test - students have three hours to write an essay on the word,
which could be innocence, water, or provocative.

7. Goals and games

Rewards and rules can encourage innovation in communities and companies.
According to gamification expert Tom Chatfield, they help to give
accurate and frequent feedback, set short-term and long-term goals, give
surprise rewards and random perks for action (including failure), and
improve social engagement between employees.

Companies should experiment with creativity rules and their impact, to
find the perfect balance between constraints and freedom. This can be
seen even in simple games like scrabble, where tweaks in the number of
letters and types of permissible words can lead to different outcomes.

Larger issues come into play when balancing considerations of safety
with opportunities for innovation in the health sector. Criteria for
college admission in different countries also reveal the varying kinds
of rules and student behaviours they induce. Similar issues arise in
allotting funding to industry-centric research versus long-term risky
bets.

8. Collaboration and conflicts

Innovation teams need to understand and master conditions of challenge,
conflicting goals, and unexpected events, and their impact on morale.
Alignment and momentum are key in the long run. Techniques like Edward
de Bono's Six Thinking Hats help balance perspectives that are logical,
creative, intuitive, organised, critical, and optimistic.

Reflection, responsibility, reinforcement, and respect are elements of
successful creative teams. Games like Tom Wujec's Marshmallow Challenge
reveal interesting dynamics about playfulness, facilitation, leadership,
and experimentation for challenges that do not have only one right
answer.

Collaboration skills include knowing when to lead, follow and sacrifice
self-interest or personal goals, as well as resolving conflicts between
people with different working styles and expectations, Tina advises.

9. Understanding failure

Unexpected observations, abandoned paths, and even failures can lead to
new discoveries. In that sense, creativity is like scientific research,
according to Tina. Companies need to have a mindset and culture of
experimentation in order to be creative.

Failures should be seen as data, she advises. "Failure is a constant
companion, and success is an occasional visitor," says Mir Imran. Rapid
prototyping and quick feedback can make it easier to give up less
feasible ideas before becoming too attached to them. Failure Faire
events celebrate learnings from intellectual, financial, emotional, and
physical risks.

Venture capital investors are willing to absorb 90 percent failure rate
in startups, knowing that the rest could be grand slams. Founders need
to be able to switch strategy in the face of low traction, as seen in
the example of textbook rental platform Chegg, which first tried to be a
broad-based bulletin board.

Experimentation and willingness to throw away what does not work best
are important for founders, as shown in the Burbn app founders pivoting
to become Instagram. "They viewed each early trial as fertiliser for the
next experiment," Tina explains.

Writers learn to discard early drafts, even though this may be painful
at times. "In writing, you must kill your darlings," according to writer
William Faulkner. Nature itself is a great example of evolution through
mutation.

Hackathons and events like Startup Weekend encourage the spirit of
experimentation under conditions of pressure. Google encourages
experimentation by putting 70 percent of its resources into the core
business, 20 percent into experiments related to the core business, and
10 percent towards new, risky long-term ideas.

10. Dreams and drive

"Believing that there is a solution to your problem is a critical step
in finding one," Tina urges. Many people, unfortunately, lack this
conviction and give up even when the solution to a challenge is in
sight.

This also applies to people who believe they are doomed by the larger
economic problems of their countries. In contrast, the Startup Chile
initiative hopes to jumpstart the country's entrepreneurial communities.

Entrepreneurs are more like quilt builders than jigsaw puzzle solvers,
according to Heidi Neck of Babson College. Entrepreneurs have more of a
fear of missing an opportunity than fear of failure. Taking small
chances and planned steps is a good way to build creative confidence and
take on larger challenges, Tina recommends.

Peter Diamandis, Founder of the X Prize Foundation, uses the grand
challenge approach to address global problems in areas like genomics and
fuel efficiency. The 1919 Oretig Prize led to Charles Lindbergh's first
flight from New York to Paris. John Kennedy's moonshot challenge spurred
the lunar missions in the 1960s.

"Many artists and entrepreneurs are propelled forward in their pursuits
not by their intellectual curiosity, but by strong feelings, including
anger, sadness, joy, or frustration," Tina explains. "Creativity isn't
entirely a cerebral act, but rather is augmented by strong emotions that
fuel fresh ideas," she adds. This helps see opportunities where others
see obstacles.

Children grow up with active imagination, curiosity, and a love for
games and roles. However, they are told to be more "serious" and
"productive" when they grow up, and focus more on "implementation".

The Innovation Engine

All the principles explained above are woven together in the Innovation
Engine framework with six components. Internal components are knowledge,
imagination and attitude; external components are resources, habitat,
and culture. All are connected and influence each other in a cumulative
and spiral manner.

"Successful entrepreneurs often come from outside of the domain of their
new venture, and their unorthodox ideas aren't inhibited by industry
doctrine," Tina explains. A "beginner's mind" helps, but usually with
expertise in a related or relevant field. Serial entrepreneurs build on
their accumulated knowledge and experience in different disciplines.

Imagination is "the catalyst required for creative combustion". It
involves reframing, connecting and combining ideas, and transforms
existing knowledge. Attitude or mindset drives our ability to achieve.
Individual behaviours can spark community changes and eventually broader
laws, as seen in the environmental movement.

Pioneering startups in each country are spurring the entrepreneurial
movement across the world, as seen in examples like Skype (Estonia),
Baidu (China), Anoosh (Saudi Arabia), Patagon (Argentina), and Aramex
(Jordan).

The organisation Endeavour is promoting such role models in emerging
economies, thus making them more accepting and supportive of future
innovators. Creativity education is also an important driver. For
example, STVP's Global Innovation Tournament spurs weeklong projects by
local entrepreneurs, some of which went on to become companies.

Tina's classroom challenges spurred projects like making lawn mats out
of hangers (Japan), carved elephants from used coconut shells
(Thailand), and a sweater made from old socks (Ireland). "I had no idea
that we are so creative," a student remarked.

"Your ideas - big and small - are the critical starting point for
innovations that propel us forward," Tina sums up.

Introduction

The growth of entrepreneurship is a significant contributor to the
country's development. It can lead to sustained economic development and
a rise in economic growth and employ-ment levels. In economic
development, business creation is beneficial for entrepreneurship, and
there are two elements of business creation, i.e., opportunity and
necessity (Fairlie and Fossen, 2018). Entrepreneurial activities,
long-time success, and economic development need the participation of
multiple factors such as adequate finances, social support, and enabling
policies by the state (Ribeiro-Soriano and Kraus, 2018). In the
structural frame-works, modern business start-up arises as modern beings
in a corporate body. For business innovation, entrepreneurial
proficiency in recognizing and influencing opportunities is the main
decision.

Moreover, the social environment and specialized education that enables
the entrepreneurial intentions among individuals facilitate the process
of business creation (Lack'eus and Middleton, 2015).

With a population of around 211.17 1 million people, Pakistan is among
the growing economies of Asia 2 expecting to establish 2.1 million
middle-income households by 2025 3 . The country advanced its
connectivity by including 3G/4G in telecommunications, while the digital
services sectors is also rising. Moreover, the surge in the E-commerce
market is evidenced 4 . Subsequently, the entrepreneurial activities
rushed as the new ventures entered the market to satisfy the public's
unmet needs across the country. The startup activities are promoted with
the introduction of incubators by the government at the national and
provincial levels; also, the tax relief of 3 years is introduced to
promote the local venture capital firms and the investors to initiate
their businesses in the country. In addition, the private sector is also
facilitating the growth through the incubators and accelerators,
initiated with the support of foreign organizations, for instance,
Google's Nest I/O, with the local venture capital.

Though, the growth of startups in Pakistan is slow compared to its peer
countries, associated with a smaller amount of funding and a few
startups, unlike the countries such as India, Nigeria, and Bangladesh.
Hence, the government and the private sector must incorporate several
significant changes to encourage entrepreneurial activities. Therefore,
it becomes essential for Pakistan to activate its weak pillars,
including the enabling policies at the government level, investment,
funding structure, and the activation of all startup ecosystem players.
Furthermore, the private and the government sector must collaborate to
gain the benefits from the country's full potential. In the same manner,
the private sector can facilitate terms of value creation and funding.
Jointly, both entities can create opportunities to unleash the country's
potential in terms of entrepreneurial development to achieve and
accelerate sustainable development goals (SDGs).

In recent years, the biggest funding agreements have taken place in
Pakistan, as shown with the examples in exhibit 1 that highlighted the
attention of investors and provided a ray of hope for the local
startups.

There are around 140 million people in Pakistan who belong to the age
bracket of under 25 years. It is considered the 6th most populous
country globally and possesses the fifth largest population comprising
youth 5 . Similarly, the consumption of households contributed 80
percent to the annual GDP, and the spending is projected to grow 5
per-cent in the impending years with the expansion of the middle class,
as shown in exhibit 2. Therefore, in line with discussed facts, Pakistan
should not lack in the startups. Still, significant challenges are
experienced by the countries with large youth populations, such as
Pakistan, which impedes the opportunities. The major challenge is
resources and un-employment (Bruton, Ahlstrom, and Li, 2010).

Likewise, entrepreneurship is primarily focused within the urban, minor
hierarchy in-dustries and micro-enterprises in Pakistan. Due to
cultural, socioeconomic, religious, and structural problems,
entrepreneurship is somehow prohibited in the rural regions of the
province of Sindh (Muhammad, McElwee, and Dana, 2017). In the ease of
doing business category, Pakistan is ranked 138 out of 189 countries
because of the challenges of small entrepreneurial activities related to
other Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India (Shabbir,
Shariff, Alshaibani, Faisal, and Salman, 2018).

Therefore, given the discussed importance of entrepreneurial growth, the
objective of this paper is to analyze the factors that affect the
intentions of youth towards entrepreneur-ship as their career choices.
In this way, the research also seeks the perspective of youth on
entrepreneurship and its potentially positive impact on the government's
current poli-cies for eradication of poverty and reduction of
unemployment to achieve sustainable goals (SDGs 1,2,5,8,9,10,11 and 13)
in Karachi, Pakistan. This research analyzes the youth's per-ceptions,
risks, challenges, and obstacles limiting their opportunities and
creating hurdles for the startups.

Followed by the introduction that demonstrated that policymakers need to
understand the lack of entrepreneurial activity in Karachi, the rest of
the study is focused on a literature review, highlighting the existing
findings on the factors responsible for the entrepreneurial intentions
among youth. Finally, a survey was developed with findings discussed in
the methodology section that provides the basis for data analysis. The
interpretation and the results obtained from the data analysis provided
the evidence to formulate the conclusion, and through such evidence, the
suggestions to the designated authorities have been made.

Literature Review

An entrepreneur is a French-language word that means 'the one who
undertakes' or 'in-between taker'. A person's professional preference to
work for himself results in the efforts to produce possible businesses,
and entrepreneurship is evolving the construction of the modern entity
(Estrin, Mickiewicz, and Stephan, 2013). The entrepreneur has the
potential to carry the risk of buying at certain and selling at
uncertain prices (Stevenson and Jarillo, 2007). By achieving something
new and varied as an objective of establishing wealth for the
individual, entrepreneurship amplifies its importance to society. Under
uncertainty, entrepreneurs govern and deploy resources to develop a
creative network of organizations for growth (Maitlo, Memon, and Shaikh,
2020). Encompassing the interactions of behavior, personal norms, and
anticipated control behavior on personal intentions, entrepreneurship
activity is established on the hypothesis of intended behavior (Lu and
Wang, 2018).

The literature emphasizes that entrepreneurship can contribute to
accomplishing sus-tainable development goals, and its implementation can
transform the initiatives. For ex-ample, the millennium development
goals were replaced by sustainable development goals in 2015; these
goals are centered on eradicating poverty and hunger, developing
peaceful societies, empowering women and girls, and protecting the
planet 6 . Similarly, these SDGs promoted a wide range of actions in the
public and private sectors through which eco-nomic growth can be
fostered in new and innovative ways. Indeed, multiple sustainable
development goals can be covered by entrepreneurial activities, and this
fact highlights the role of institutional factors that influence
entrepreneurial talent and socioeconomic growth (Urbano, Aparicio, and
Audretsch, 2019).

Therefore, entrepreneurship can be a transforma-tional factor, offering
the provision for accomplishing the SDGs even as powering economic
growth is directed by sustainable development principles. Also, within
the sustainable development domain, Entrepreneurship is advocated as the
vehicle for empowerment, and it is considered an enabling element of
economic development, alleviation of poverty, and enhancement of social
values (Kaijage, 2013).

Furthermore, the literature examination showed that business could turn
into the driv-ing and characterizing power of youth's monetary turn of
events (Kasim, Zulkharnain, Hashim, Ibrahim, and Yusof, 2014; Ong,
Shang, Chandra, Hamidi, and Wahab, 2021). Newly industrialized Southeast
Asia, including South Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan, have inspired and
built up their childhood populace with an innovative methodology that
has added to a quick accomplishment of practical financial growth.
Geldhof et al. (2014) saw that finan-cial advancement generally depends
on shrewd business visionaries' dynamic and energetic cooperation in the
monetary cycle. A few researchers have shown that a business venture is
not just advantageous yet vital for a sound economy (Aggarwal, 2018;
Sergi, Popkova, Bogoviz, and Ragulina, 2019). Edward Lazear likewise
stresses that "business venture is the absolute most significant part in
a cutting edge economy" (2005, p1).

Because of the contentions outlined in these references, it is sensible
to expect that the pioneering empow-ering arrangements make work through
which youth (known to be flighty) acquire mental, monetary, and social
solidness towards a safe future. Monetary development typically went
with an adjustment of disposition, advancement, innovativeness, and
hazard taking, all of which assist adolescents with going about as
reasonable vote based residents and an essen-tial source in developing
the economy as beneficial human resources and adding to financial
manageability (Carree and Thurik, 2010).

Exploration uncovers that business is currently the absolute most
significant factor for the financial turn of events (Acs et al., 2006).
An exploration study completed by the Kauffman Foundation on MIT
graduated class uncovers that these alumni made many organizations that
utilize over 1,000,000 experts and have yearly world deals of about 2
trillion, delivering what could be compared to the eleventh biggest
economy on the planet (Fairlie, 2010). The enterprising viewpoint of
these alumni shifted the customary direction of advancement among youth
and accomplished a soundtrack of financial development. Malaysia today
represents 86.5 percent of the complete cutting-edge fares of the
Islamic world and is positioned 10th on the planet in this
classification, in front of numerous European countries. This
development happened due to a pioneering approach and the environment
for business that was created there (Koltai, 2016).

These raw numbers show the force of an enterprising point of view to
support and help to accomplish feasible financial development quickly.
For Karachi, the business might be the way to progress.

This exploration is worried about the mentality of youth toward business
ventures. Following the discoveries, the exploration is centered around
the impression of youth about the elements that will advance the
business venture alongside the issues that obstruct them in seeking new
companies. This study is significant because the writing upholds an end
that young are less disposed towards business ventures due to
exceptionally unsure conditions about the course of day-by-day business,
helpless lawfulness, and financial emergencies (The World Factbook,
2015). These add to vulnerability about the eventual fate of their
professions and the city's fate. While Government approaches do not take
into account tending to these worries, government arrangements should
screen and figure the strategies that would work with business visionary
training, business backing, and admittance to assets for youth to help
accomplish feasible financial development of Karachi.

This analysis is generally the contention advanced by the new writing on
the significance of making enterprising biological systems to help add
to the stable support of youth in the public arena and, along these
lines, political steadiness in slacking economies (Stough, 2016).

The study's conceptual framework is backed by the empirical findings and
focuses on the factors that contributed to the success of
entrepreneurship according to the perception of youth. The factors that
have been included in the model are shown in the model below:

Operational definitions

Financial factors

It includes the elements such as financial literacy, financial
resources, and access to financial capital.

Personal factors

It includes the attitude towards entrepreneurship, risk perception, fear
of failure, and self-efficacy.

Governmental factors

It includes the elements such as government support, business
regulations, license require-ments, local and international trade
regulations, and the policies for entrepreneurial star-tups.

Social factors

It includes the elements such as social capital, social relationships,
social local support environment, support from family, and social
circle.

Hypotheses Development

Based on the empirical literature, the following research hypotheses
have been developed to investigate the perspective of youth towards the
factors that will hinder or encourage Entrepreneurship and its
importance for the sustainable socio-economic growth of Karachi.

H1: There is a significant relationship between financial factors and
Entrepreneurship that led to sustainable socio-economic growth.

H2: There is a significant relationship between personal factors and
Entrepreneurship that led to sustainable socio-economic growth.

H3: There is a significant relationship between governmental factors and
Entrepreneur-ship that led to sustainable socio-economic growth.

H4: There is a significant relationship between social factors and
Entrepreneurship that led to sustainable socio-economic growth.

Methodology

In the present study, the research design is correlational, through
which the relationship between perceived factors by the youth and
entrepreneurship is explored. The degree of relatedness among the
variables is determined through correlational analysis. The Prag-matic
research design is selected as the research intends to provide a
workable solution for the stated research hypotheses. Likewise, in the
current research study, a sample of the youth population in Karachi
composed of 15 to 29-year-old is targeted. Karachi is the capital of the
Pakistani province of Sindh. It is the most populous city in Pakistan
and the sixth-most populous city globally 7 .

After collecting data, the data is analyzed through the Statistical
Package of Social Sciences (SPSS). First, the data screening is done,
and the process of outliers removal is done. Also, the demographic
characteristics of respondents are analyzed through descrip-tive
analysis. After the data cleaning, the data is analyzed through Partial
Least Square Modelling PLS-SEM.

Structural equation modeling is the multivariate data analysis technique
that is con-sidered a second-generation technique and is introduced to
overcome the limitations of the first-generation method. The technique
of SEM is believed to possess more power for testing the multiple
relationships among the variables. Moreover, the SEM technique can
determine both the causal and the linear relationships of the research
model. The PLS-SEM comprises two major components: the measurement model
and the structural model. The primary function of the measurement model
is an assessment of the validity and reliability of the items included
to measure the variables. The confirmatory factor analysis is performed
due to the adoption of already established scales. The construct
reli-ability and validity are tested through scores of Cronbach alpha,
composite reliability, and average variance. The construct is tested for
both convergent and discriminant validity and reliability.

Likewise, the structural model is applied for testing the assumed
relationships of the research framework through bootstrapping. The
structural paths and the relationship between the variables are
determined through the structural model, along with the nature of the
relationship between the variables. It provides the significance or
insignificance of the hypothesized relationship. In addition, the
relevance of the research model is evaluated through the Q square value.
At the same time, the predictive accuracy is determined through the R
square value, which is obtained through blindfolding.

Data Analysis

The sample for the current study consisted of 200 young individuals. The
demographic details of those respondents are shown in table 1. The table
reflects that there were 113 males among the sample while there were 87
females. Also, the response of youth towards entrepreneurship is shown.
The data from the survey shows that the number of youth who have a
graduate degree is 20%, and the unemployed individuals were 9.4%. The
number of individuals out of the labor force was 4.9%. The self-employed
were 3.5%, while 10.6% of the youth were not working.

Measurement Model Assessment

The evaluation of the measurement model is performed for the examination
of reliability, validity of the scale.

Construct Reliability and Convergent Validity

To determine the construct's reliability and validity, the study
utilized the coefficient of reliability for measuring internal
consistency. Also, the convergent validity is evaluated to check how
well the variables are measured by their selected items. For checking
the convergent validity, the scores of AVE are used. The results are
stated in table 2, which reflects the individual factor loadings, which
need to be greater than 0.55, as suggested in the studies of Tabachnick,
Fidell, and Ullman (2007) and 0.7. Hence, it can be seen that the scores
of composite reliabilities are as per the proposed criteria. Also, the
values of Cronbach α are higher than the proposed value of 0.7, which
indicates that the scale is reliable. In addition, the Fornell and
larcker (1981) criteria were utilized to analyze convergent validity.
Therefore, the AVE scores should be higher than 0.5 for the fulfillment
of the convergent validity requirement.

Discriminant Validity

For analyzing the discriminant validity, the evaluation of
cross-loadings and AVE scores is done. It indicates how much the
incorporated measures are unrelated to each other.

Fornell and Larcker Criterion

For the existence of acceptable discriminant validity, the square root
of AVE must be higher than the correlations of the constructs. The
correlation matrix is represented in table 3, which shows that the AVE
square roots are higher for each of the constructs for each.

Analysis of Cross-loadings

This analysis is performed to check how the items in all the variables
are cross-loaded against each other. The criteria according to which the
loading of each item should be higher on their respective constructs
compared to its cross-loadings. Also, the differences in cross-loadings
need to be larger than 0.1; hence all the given criteria are fulfilled,
as shown in table 4.

Model Fitness

Determination of Predictive relevance through Blindfolding

While analyzing the fitness of the research model, it is essential to
determine how much relevance lies in the prediction by the research
model. Therefore, the function of blindfold-ing is applied to check the
predictive relevance of the model. The relevance is evaluated through
Stone-Geisser's Q2 value . Such value is utilized as the criteria of
evaluation. Ac-cording to the suggested threshold, the value needs to be

Determination of Predictive power through R square

It is necessary to determine how accurately the research model can
predict the changes in the dependent variable. For this purpose, the R
square analysis is conducted. The value of R square indicates the level
that how much contribution is done by the independent variables in
explaining the dependent variable. This value is also known as the
coefficient of determination. For example, in the present study, the R
square of entrepreneurship is 0.553, which indicates that the selected
independent variables explain 55.3% of the research model, and it is a
moderate value, the threshold values of R square such as substantial =
0.67, weak = 0.19 and moderate = 0.33.

Assessment of the Structural Model

The structural model has assessed the predictive power of the research
model. Further-more, it provides evidence of acceptance/rejection of the
developed hypotheses through the assessment based on path analysis. The
obtained results of the structural model anal-ysis are presented in
table 6. To test the hypothesized relationships, the direct effects are
presented.

Discussion

The table as mentioned above 8 shows the statistical significance of the
regression path Financial factors → Entrepreneurship which provides the
evidence for the acceptance of Hypothesis 1 at significance level
(β=0.363, p<0.05). It examines the impact of financial factors on the
growth of entrepreneurship. This is statistically proven that financial
factors play a significant role in shaping youth entrepreneurial
intentions and transforming inten-tion into the actual startup. The
results are consistent with the existing findings in the literature of
Hulsink and Koek (2014); Oseifuah (2010), which assure that financial
factors are the essential prerequisites for any new entrepreneurial
venture. The results showed that one major component is financial
literacy among the financial factors. When individuals lack financial
knowledge and money management, they are more prone to startup failures.
So, the knowledge of financial management is necessary for the growth of
entrepreneurship among youth.

In a country like Pakistan, there is a lack of academic support that
pro-vides financial knowledge to young students; they are less confident
and avoid investing in new ventures. Another primary component in the
financial factors is access to financial capital; entrepreneurship grows
in those countries where the young individuals have mul-tiple
opportunities for getting the financial capital and where it is easy for
them to attain the investment from potential investors. Also, the
microfinance facilities boost the new ventures. Thus, slow
entrepreneurial growth in Pakistan is the difficult access to financial
capital and a lack of financial support facilities.

Similarly, the regression path Personal factors → Entrepreneurship shows
the statistical significance and provides the evidence for the
acceptance of Hypothesis 2 at significance level ((β=0.035, p<0.05). The
results of this hypothesis declared that personal factors, including the
attitude of the young individuals and their perception of risk
associated with entrepreneurship, also play a significant role in
determining their entrepreneurial intentions. When the individuals have
a more positive attitude towards the new self-ventures than the
employment opportunity, there are more chances of involvement in
entrepreneurial activities. Also, the level of competence possessed by
the young entrepreneurs affects the growth of entrepreneurship, as
stated by Wang, Wang, and Chang (2018).

Moreover, the fear of failure they possess in their mind is the
restraining factor that slows down the entrepreneurial growth in the
developing country like Pakistan, where the people are highly
risk-averse owing to unstable economic conditions and the instability in
economic policies, where the fear of losing the investment among
individuals is high.

The regression path of Governmental factors→Entrepreneurship is also
statistically significant and infers that Hypothesis 3 is accepted at
the significance level ((β=0.300, p<0.05). The acceptance of the
hypothesis suggests that governmental factors are crucial in fostering
entrepreneurial intentions among youth. The support from the government
in the form of entrepreneurial enabling policies is essential in a
country such as Pakistan, where the economic conditions are so volatile,
and the individuals lack the funds and en-trepreneurial opportunities.
Also, the business regulations imposed by the government for the
entrepreneurial setups are the contributing factor in shaping
entrepreneurial intentions among youth. In a country like Pakistan, the
policies are strict, and the procedures are complicated, which creates
hurdles for young individuals in starting their new businesses.

In the same way, the statistically significant regression path is Social
Factors→Entrepre-neurship, which shows that Hypothesis 4 is accepted at
the significance level ((β=0.171, p<0.05). The statistical significance
of the hypothesis showed that social factors are im-portant in building
entrepreneurial intentions among youth. In Pakistan, the culture is
collectivist and the people prefer to involve in those activities
supported and favored by the family members and the social
relationships. However, in Pakistan, family support is missing as people
perceive that new ventures will face difficulties and cannot secure
desired profits.

Conclusion

The current research study is based on investigating factors that affect
the entrepreneurial intentions of youth. Entrepreneurship is an
essential factor that can enhance the sustain-able socio-economic
development of any country. The developing country, i.e., Pakistan, is
emphasized for the investigation. The survey is conducted on the youth
population to analyze the factors that created the challenges for the
young entrepreneurs, along with the factors that assisted them in
starting their self-ventures. The data was collected and analyzed based
on the quantitative research approach. The analysis is conducted through
PLS-SEM techniques that determine the instrument's reliability, the
convergent and dis-criminant validity, and finally, the regression
results through path analysis. The results revealed that all the
hypotheses are accepted and declared that financial factors, personal
factors, governmental factors, and social factors are the significant
contributors to youth entrepreneurial intentions.

Policy Recommendation

The current research possessed recommendations for the governmental
authorities respon-sible for the growth of entrepreneurship in Pakistan.
Also, the research can be helpful in the identification of factors that
can foster entrepreneurship in Pakistani society. Although the
statistical results show that the policies and government support can
play a significant role in fostering entrepreneurship, at the government
level, many changes can be done at the government level that will
minimize the challenges that the youth has faced in the country.
Firstly, the financial factors need to be improved. Therefore, it is
suggested that there should be financial platforms that offer access to
capital and financial resources for the new entrepreneurial startups
because the lack of financial resources is the biggest issue that deters
the growth of entrepreneurship.

Furthermore, there is a need to enhance financial literacy among youth.
The aca-demic curriculum of business studies should integrate the
courses on financial management so students can manage their startups
without relying on external financial managers. Moreover, the business
incubators for entrepreneurs will aid the entrepreneurial practices.
Family support also plays a significant role in building entrepreneurial
intentions. Thus, young individuals should be supported positively and
encouragingly.

Recommendations for Future Studies

The current study focuses only on the specific factors that are the
significant contributors to entrepreneurial intentions among youth. It
is suggested that future studies should incor-porate other underlying
factors such as social entrepreneurship, family background, Green
economy, awareness about the SDGs, and personal capability to determine
entrepreneurial intentions. Also, the research can be conducted through
the different statistical approaches that have been applied in the
current research. In the same manner, future studies can alter the
research sample; it can be conducted on specific populations such as
business students and IT students.

Such has been the magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on air
travel demand that the airline industry has to some extent been in a
stasis since last March – along with much of the normal airline
failures, mergers and start-up activity that might have been expected.

Simply surviving the crisis has been the focus for airlines, meaning
there has been little time or available finance to pursue acquisitions.
Likewise, a reduction in the appetite for start-ups is hardly
surprising, as the volume of travel remains stymied by ongoing
restrictions and quarantines.

The relatively small number of airline failures recorded in 2020 is
perhaps more counter-intuitive, given the tough operating climate. It is
however explained by the unprecedented levels of financial support many
governments have provided to keep carriers on life support through the
crisis.

As a result, most of the airline failures last year took place or were
well in motion before the pandemic hit.

Even before the crisis struck the industry, Air Italy was forced to
suspend operations after its Italian co-owners pulled the plug on
further funding. And Taiwan’s Far Eastern Air Transport – which had
abruptly ceased operations in December 2019 only to rescind a closure
notice within days – had its operating licence revoked on 31 January.

But the highest profile pre-crisis failure was UK regional carrier
Flybe, which lost its long battle for survival in early March.

While the early impact on air travel demand from the Covid-19 outbreak
proved a final straw for Flybe, it had been under financial pressure for
many years, with its acquisition in 2019 by the Connect Airways
consortium a final attempt to reset the struggling carrier.

Another tipping point for Flybe appeared to be the UK government
resisting appeals to rescue it. While an intervention in January 2020
had proved enough to secure further investment from Flybe’s
shareholders, it stopped short of a bailout.

Yet once the pandemic set in, it was government financial intervention
across the globe, both through direct state aid or wider business
support measures such as job protection schemes, that limited the number
of airlines joining the casualty list.

Those that did cease operations did so often as a result of strategic
decisions by their parent carriers. The plug was pulled on AirAsia
Japan, Cathay Dragon, LATAM Airlines Argentina, Level Europe, NokScoot,
SunExpress Germany and Tigerair Australia during 2020, as shareholder
airlines focused on dealing with challenges to their core business.

In the USA, the pain was predominantly felt by regional operators –
mostly the impact of consolidation in feeder flights for the majors.
Trans States Holdings operators Compass Air and Trans States Airlines
were the first to go, in April, followed at the end of September by
ExpressJet Airlines, after United Airlines consolidated Embraer ERJ-145
feeder flights around CommutAir.

The year closed with Montenegro Airlines ceasing operations from 26
December, attributing the decision to the refusal of the country’s
government to continue supporting it.

While many airlines were kept in the skies by government support
packages, numerous others turned to formal restructurings for the
necessary breathing space. Latin America’s three largest operators –
Aeromexico, Avianca and LATAM Airlines Group – all filed for bankruptcy
protection in US courts. Norwegian has secured similar creditor
protection under Irish and Norwegian law, while it continues to
restructure.

Virgin Australia successfully emerged restructured under new owners Bain
Capital in November, seven months after entering voluntary
administration. Virgin Atlantic, meanwhile, completed a privately-funded
solvent recapitalisation under a court-sanctioned process in the UK.

South African carrier Comair too emerged under new ownership following a
formal restructuring, and resumed flights in December.

While much of the industry remains on its knees, a dearth of air traffic
and bleak prognosis for an immediate recovery has not completely put off
airline newcomers. As last year drew to a close, several new operations
moved closer to launch, and a few took to the air for the first time.

In December, Canadian airline OWG carried out its inaugural scheduled
revenue flight, from Toronto’s Pearson International airport to Santa
Clara Abel Santamaria airport in Cuba. The airline is a project of
Canadian passenger and freight charter carrier Nolinor Aviation, which
announced plans to launch the new brand amid the crisis last July,
originally hoping to launch services at the end of August.

China Eastern Airlines subsidiary OTT Airlines carried out its maiden
flight on 28 December. The unit, plans for which were unveiled last
February, will focus on operation of domestically-manufactured aircraft
– initially Comac ARJ21 regional jets – on domestic flights within
mainland China.

A new South African start-up, Lift Airlines, also carried out its first
flight in December. A collaboration between investors and South African
wet-lease operator Global Aviation, it joins the hard-hit domestic
market at a time of renewed competition.

Alongside the revamped Comair, which operates flights under the British
Airways and budget Kulula brands, the newly independent Airlink is
operating under its own brand after the end of its long-standing
franchise with South African Airways (SAA).

For its part, SAA is still mired in a painful restructuring, more than a
year after entering business rescue, while state-owned regional carrier
SA Express remains grounded and under provisional liquidation as efforts
to secure a buyer continue.

Boosted network

One of the first new operations to launch in 2020 after the pandemic
struck was the Abu Dhabi joint venture carrier between Air Arabia and
Etihad Airways. While the launch of the low-cost unit was delayed
because of the health crisis, Air Arabia Abu Dhabi started operations in
July on routes to Egypt, and has since steadily boosted its network.

European low-cost carrier Wizz Air had hoped to launch flights during
2020 with its own Abu Dhabi operation, a joint venture with state
holding company ADQ. However, this was pushed back amid continued travel
restrictions, with the carrier planning to operate its first flight in
January, to Athens. It will serve an initial network of destinations
across the Mediterranean and Caucasus regions.

Having been in the works for several years, South Korean start-up Aero K
was granted its operating licence in late December.

In the same month, Brazilian start-up Voe Nella disclosed plans to
launch passenger and cargo flights by the end of the first quarter 2021
with ATR and Boeing aircraft.

Plans for a new Ukraine carrier called Bees Airline emerged in November,
when Swiss AviationSoftware disclosed its AMOS package’s selection by
the start-up to manage maintenance processes.

Hong Kong start-up Greater Bay Airlines also has moved closer to launch,
with the South China Morning Post reporting in late December that the
carrier has recruited Cathay Dragon’s departing chief Algernon Yau to
lead it. Operations could begin as early as the summer season, using
leased aircraft.

A notable thread among the airline start-ups is familiar faces
re-emerging. For example, among those leading South Africa’s Lift is
former Comair chief executive Gidon Novick, while Erik Braathen is
working on establishing a new Norwegian carrier.

In December ‘Flyr’ was revealed as the brand name for the new Norwegian
airline, which aims to commence services in the first half of 2021. It
is being established by a team including Braathen as well as pilots from
a number of Scandinavian carriers.

One of the figures behind new Irish carrier Emerald Airlines is
reportedly Conor McCarthy; chief executive of MRO firm Dublin Aerospace
and a former Ryanair and AirAsia executive.

Emerald has thrown its hat in the ring to replace Stobart Air when the
latter’s long-term franchise deal with Aer Lingus expires at the end of
2022. The Irish flag carrier confirms it entered a period of exclusive
negotiations with Emerald over a contract to operate Aer Lingus Regional
franchise flights from 2023.

In the USA, Breeze Airways – the highest-profile launch project in the
country for years – is being led by JetBlue and Azul founder David
Neeleman.

Breeze had intended to launch services in 2020, but the Salt Lake
City-headquartered budget carrier pushed back its plans to 2021 due to
the pandemic. A move to acquire the air operator certificate of defunct
US regional Compass was ultimately dropped, with the carrier instead
pursuing a “stand-alone Breeze DOT/FAA approvals/certificate”.

Former United and Allegiant Air executive Andrew Levy was also working
on a US start-up carrier, although there has been little public update
on the project since the pandemic hit.

There is also some familiarity in other projects, as moves continue to
revive Flybe, and India’s Jet Airways, which collapsed in early 2019.
Flybe administrators were reported in October to have sold the assets
for the airline to Thyme Opco with a view to resuming regional
operations in 2021. Thyme Opco has links to Cyrus Capital Partners,
which was one of the backers of the Connect Airways consortium.

Jet could be flying again by summer, after its creditors last October
approved a bid from entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan and asset management
firm Kalrock.

The biggest airline merger of 2020, meanwhile, was also a consequence of
the crisis. In November, Korean Air announced plans to acquire rival
network carrier Asiana Airlines.

Korean’s opportunistic move came after a deal under which Asiana’s
majority shareholder Kumho Industrial was to sell a controlling interest
in the carrier to HDC Hyundai Development fell through last September,
after HDC reportedly sought to re-negotiate the acquisition.

Korean notes that, unlike other countries with a population below 100
million, South Korea has two full service carriers, which it argues
gives it a “competitive disadvantage” compared to France, Germany and
Singapore, which have a single major airline. The merger with Asiana
will enable it to “compete with global mega airlines”, it says.

Korean plans to present an “integration plan” by 17 March relating to
its acquisition of Asiana, with shareholders having endorsed the move on
6 January.

The integration plan will also see both carriers’ low-cost units – Air
Busan, Air Seoul and Jin Air – merged into a single entity.

But a separate tie-up in the South Korean market fell victim to the
crisis. Jeju Air scrapped plans, agreed in December 2019, to acquire a
majority stake in Easter Jet. Local reports suggest an undisclosed South
Korean firm is now in the final stages of sealing a deal for the
low-cost carrier.

Another planned deal scuppered by the crisis was a January 2020 move by
LOT Polish Airlines’ parent PGL to acquire German leisure carrier
Condor.

IAG had hoped to by mid-2020 close a deal to acquire Air Europa to
bolster its Spanish operations. While the group has insisted that the
rationale behind the deal remains strong, it has been seeking to
renegotiate the terms of a deal. Recent Spanish media reports suggest
these have been agreed, although IAG is still to finalise the
acquisition.

A deal for Air Canada to acquire Canadian leisure operator Air Transat
has also been renegotiated since the crisis. In December, Air Transat
shareholders backed the new sale terms and a Canadian court subsequently
approved the transaction.

What 2021 might hold in store for the air transport sector remains to be
seen, but further failures as a result of the pandemic – or as
governments wind down their support measures when any recovery does come
– seem highly likely. ◗

While state aid packages continue to sustain many carriers during the
pandemic, last year’s huge slump in demand contributed to the demise of
multiple airlines around the globe

The last two months have been quite eventful for Nepali startups. First,
Foodmandu, Nepal’s largest food delivery platform, has secured its
second-round investment from Team Ventures, a private equity (PE)
firm.Then, Health at Home, a healthcare services portal, also got
funding from Business Oxygen (BO2), Nepal’s first PE fund. It was
followed by first round funding of Rs 90 million in e-commerce site
Sastodeal from Dolma Impact Fund.The ﬂurry of investment by PE ﬁrms
illustrates how Nepali startup ecosystem is growing from its infancy and
how startup companies are slowly becoming avenues of investments.The
last 7 to 8 years have seen an emergence of energetic youths with
diﬀerent innovative entrepreneurial ideas and solutions. Networking
events, pitching sessions, mentorship and events related to alternative
ﬁnancing are some of the areas that have noticeably grown over the
decade.The Nepali startup ecosystem is now inundated with several tech
integrated ideas in sectors such as agriculture, hospitality,
e-commerce, digital payment, education, entertainment and many more. To
name a few, R&amp;D Innovative Solutions, Red Mud, eSewa, Khalti, Cloud
Factory, Health at Home, Online Ausadhi, Sastodeal, Urban Girl, Kirana
Pasal, Foodmandu, Foodmario, Khalisisi, Tootle, Karkhana, Upaya City
Cargo, Bricks, Sajilo Marmat Sewa and Gham Power are some of the
impactful and growing ventures.

Many of these ventures are in the startup phase.

And some have been sustaining and scaling themselves in the market for
around a decade. Though there is no particular deﬁnition and criteria
for a ‘startup’ to be a startup, experts believe that the enterprise
must be innovative, tech-driven and scalable to come in the bracket.
Many other impactful ventures have been able to partner with thousands
of clients which include farmers from rural areas. R&amp;D Innovative
Solutions is one such enterprise which has connected with 17,000 farmers
helping them to add value to their production and marketing.There are
companies like Khalisisi, which has not only been bridging the gap
between waste sellers and trash collectors but has also created an
environment of self-respect when doing the job. 300 Khalsisi friends of
the startup connect with customers through an app and come to the
doorstep to collect the trash. How it All Began The attention towards
youth entrepreneurship began in 2003 when the Federation of Nepalese
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) oﬃcially instituted Nepal
Youth Entrepreneurs Forum (NYEF). From mentorship to providing a
platform for marketing and investment through its pool of angel
investors, NYEF has been a crucial player in the youth entrepreneurship
ecosystem. It was around 2008-2009 when a few players in the Nepali
Business Ecosystem started free events like Last Thursdays organised by
Entrepreneurs for Nepal (E4N) and workshops like Arthalaya (school of
economics and entrepreneurship) organised by Samriddhi Foundation, an
economic policy think tank. “Though Last Thursdays kept both businessmen
and entrepreneurs in the same place, it helped the society to get a few
role models in the world of business,” says Ashutosh Tiwari, managing
director at Safal Partners, an investment management company. Tiwari was
one of the co-founders of E4N which was started in 2008. Similarly,
Arthalaya workshop created a platform where young graduates learnt about
the know-how of entrepreneurship and the unseen intentions and
consequences of policies in business. “Arthalaya developed three kinds
of people - entrepreneurs, economic researchers and economic writers and
bloggers,” says Deependra Chaulagain, director of operations at
Samriddhi Foundation. Prior to these initiatives, programmes like Micro
Enterprise Development Program (MEDEP) started in 1998 (now Micro
Enterprise Development for Poverty Alleviation) by UNDP and the
Government of Nepal produced many micro-entrepreneurs in the areas of
farming, handicraft and other conventional sectors. In 2011, Vidhan Rana
started Biruwa Ventures, an alternative workplace and helped several
entrepreneurs by providing them shared spaces. During the time, the
country was going through long hours of daily power cut also known as
‘load-shedding’.The co-working spaces concept initiated by Biruwa
encouraged many others to start a similar concept.The venture also
facilitated mentorship and investment while working with entrepreneurs.

Another major community was formed in 2012 when a group of entrepreneurs
came together to support and encourage the youth with innovative ideas.
“We decided to build a community when we listened to various new ideas.

But ideas were not enough to start entrepreneurship, so we started
working on developing an entrepreneurial mindset,” says Suman Shakya,
cofounder of Nepal Entrepreneurs Hub (NEHUB). Startup Weekend is one of
their key platforms which has already worked with around 700 youths and
has reached its 15th edition. “Among them, 12 percent have their own
business now,” says Shakya. In the last ﬁve years, many support systems
including boot camps, seed camps, incubation and startup meets have been
held. Some of the monthly and weekly meets including Monday Morning
Coﬀee Queries organised by Clock B Business Innovations and Monday
Morning Meeting organised by NYEF have been playing key roles to spread
the entrepreneurial vibe among energetic youths willing to initiate
innovation in diﬀerent sectors. Over a decade ago, there were hardly any
students in college who wanted to become entrepreneurs. Today, there are
very few who don’t want to pursue entrepreneurship. With this mindset
developing among the school and college students, universities have also
been coming up with business incubators to develop an entrepreneurial
culture among students. Some of the colleges which have been running
incubation centres are Kings College, Kathmandu University, Uniglobe
College and Presidential College of Management Sciences. Idea Studios,
the ﬁrst business incubation centre in Nepal, has been running lab-based
two-month long incubation programmes and also a reality TV show where
ideators pitch their ideas. I3 Business Incubation programme is another
initiative by Nepal Communitere.

Antarprerana is also another company which has been organising
incubation programmes for college students and entrepreneurs outside the
Kathmandu Valley.

After 2014, business accelerator programmes were started to support the
startups to scale up. Next Venture Corp, Rockstart Impact and Enterprise
are three regular accelerator programmes. Gradually, people with money
and enthusiasm came forward in the scene as angel investors to
collaborate with innovative entrepreneurs. On the other hand, large PE
ﬁrms including One to Watch, True North Associates, Business Oxygen and
Dolma Impact Fund also have emerged as an alternative ﬁnancing platform
for promising and impactful ventures. “When BO2 started almost ﬁve years
ago, there was very little idea about what private equity venture
capital was all about. But now, there have been so many workshops and
competitions where the likes of Microsoft and the Indian Embassy have
been involved,” says Siddhant Raj Pandey, Chairman and CEO of Business
Oxygen. “The best part, in the past four years, as an alternative form
of ﬁnancing in Nepal, is the access to ﬁnance to private equity. This
not only brings capital but also knowledge transfer as well as capacity
building, technology-wise,” says Pandey.

After around a decade of eﬀ orts, today, the entrepreneurial climate has
changed, especially in the capital city. Thousands of aspiring youths
pitch their ideas every year in diﬀerent pitching events. Several
hundred enter boot camps and among them, a few start their ventures.
Nava-Udhyamshala, organised by Antarprerana, Startup Weekend organised
by NEHUB and Udhyami Seed Camp organised by Startups Nepal are a few
boot camps done regularly. “Startups have been one area where the youth
have been doing experimentation. Though many ventures don’t turn
sustainable; they fail, get up, learn and go for it again,” says Binay
Devkota, founder of Clock B Business Innovations, a Nepali ﬁrm
specialising in startup business consulting and investment. Similarly,
events incorporating various stakeholders in the startup scene have been
increasing every year.There are 5 to 6 major events relating to startups
each year. Nepal Startup Summit, Next Growth Conclave and Connect In are
just some of them. “The interesting thing is nowadays I ﬁnd 70 to 80
percent new faces in every event. This was not the scenario two years
back,” says Devkota of Clock B. This shows that these platforms are
bringing massive networking opportunities. Sunita Nemaphuki, who started
R&amp;D Innovative Solutions in 2010, says that the approach towards
agriculture has evolved in the last 10 years. “Earlier, people used to
associate agriculture with production and trading only. Now, agriculture
is directly related to entrepreneurship.

And the best part is, the youth are coming to this sector,” says
Nemaphuki. Market Demands Seriousness More and more youths are coming
into the scene and meanwhile, a critical mass questioning the
sustainability of such ventures is also growing. “Startups in Nepal are
yet to come up with ground-breaking ideas and solutions,” says Niranjan
Shrestha, former president of Nepal Young entrepreneurs Forum (NYEF). He
thinks that some companies in advanced areas like artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI) pose a huge potential both nationally and internationally for
Nepali startups. “Gradually, in the process of maturity, many ventures
will be ﬁltered and few will survive,” says Niraj Khanal, cofounder of
Antarprerana.The global trend shows that 90 percent of startups fail.
Some of the generic reasons for failure are incompetence, personal
problems and market irrelevancy. Though there is no concrete data for
Nepal, experts say that more than 90 percent of startups are failing in
Nepal.The stakeholders including venture capital investors and mentors
say that almost 50 percent of startups which existed 4 to 5 years ago
have stopped functioning. N’s Fresh Snack, Koolkat, 11 Beep and Cash on
Ad are some Nepali startup companies that received acclaimed for
innovative business ideas but were forced to wind down their operations
later after becoming unable to sustain ﬁnancially. While cash ﬂow is one
major reason for the failure, there are various other reasons which
contribute to creating failure and crisis in the long term. Except for a
few of the founders who are serious about the sustainability of their
venture, experts say that many entrepreneurs are still in the fantasy
stage. “There are many companies that haven’t been able to scale-up in
the last 4 to 5 years,” observes Narottam Aryal, president of King’s
College, which also runs a business incubator for students.The topics of
discussion in the gatherings have evolved with time. “Earlier, we used
to discuss ideas, disruption and passion. Now, we mostly discuss
diﬃculties, conﬂicts and challenges of enterprises and stakeholders
relating to them,” says Aryal. During pitching events, there are streams
of ideators who share big ideas. But most of them have no idea about
their revenue model. While talking to newly established startups, most
of them express their vision to go international in the next ﬁve years.
In reality, they haven’t been able to step out of Kathmandu. “The
pitching sessions are full of idealistic expressions, and the pitchers
are mostly emotionally charged,” shares Aryal, adding, “The ideas are
not grounded and lack logic and data. Most importantly, it doesn’t
address consumer needs.” Events help startups to grow because networks
convert to investment and partnerships in the long term. But a rule of
life, that ‘too much of anything is bad’ certainly applies to the
industry as well.

According to investors, startups are mostly busy going to events and
participating in panel discussions. “While they should prioritise their
ﬁnance and operational excellence, they care more about their reputation
and social credibility in the market,” says Devkota. Kavi Raj Joshi,
co-founder of Next Venture Corp agrees with Devkota on this point. “The
founders should be serious in doing their business rather than focusing
on gaining trust,” Joshi says. Sunita Nemaphuki and Damber Khanal, COO
of R&amp;D Innovative Solutions, recall the initial days when they used
to go to every event relating to entrepreneurship. “Too much panel
discussion divides your time when you should be focussing on internal
operations,” the husband-wife duo shares. ‘Startup’ being a new concept
has been getting considerable space in various media outlets.The
contents are mostly positive which creates hype for a particular
company. However, experts are cynical about too much media coverage in
the initial stage. Nepali entrepreneurs keep talking about Steve Jobs,
Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson and many other international
personalities. But most don’t know about their sustainable revenue model
which keeps them in the market. “Many entrepreneurs are getting stardom
without achieving success. Now, media should stay back and ﬁlter the
startups before covering their activities,” suggests Shakya.

According to entrepreneurs, lack of transparency and hesitation to
receive help from contemporaries is another reason why many startups
fold. Nemaphuki, who started her ﬁrst business at the age of 17 talks
about how she has been overcoming crises related to ﬁnances. “The
startup ecosystem has been really helpful during the time of crisis.
However, we should be open to approaching other entrepreneurs and be
transparent about our challenges,” she says. Startup entrepreneurs like
Nemaphuki who have learned from their experiences in running a business
in the last few years see cash ﬂow as the lifeblood and operations as
the spine of any business. Manohar Adhikari, founder of Foodmandu shares
that he was running his software business to maintain cash ﬂow in the
initial days of his venture. “I fully came to Foodmandu only after it
gained traction in the market after four years,” says Adhikari. Idea
duplication has been another huge mistake of the entrepreneurs due to
which they don’t get recognition. Startups also face failure when their
ideas become irrelevant in the market. Little market research is carried
out, experts say. With the lack of proper research, entrepreneurs end up
bringing ideas that are irrelevant in the local market. “In this case,
entrepreneurs need to change their business model. Or else the venture
will not survive. Entrepreneurs who research continuously and are in the
mission to solve real problems will sustain themselves in the market,”
says Kavi Raj Joshi, founder and managing director of Next Venture Corp.
Many entrepreneurs have been exploring diﬀerent ideas with viable
business models. Ventures like Foodmario which has been a platform for
many homemakers to earn from their cooking skills were also evolved
after a lot of brainstorming and research. “Finally, we came up with the
idea of Foodmario because I wanted to create a business that can become
a platform for others. Meanwhile, we have a good revenue model in this
business,” says Rohit Tiwari, co-founder of Foodmario, who pitched his
idea at Udhyami Seed Camp.

According to Aryal, it takes 3 to 6 months to do proper market research
if the idea doesn’t involve too many technicalities and innovation.
However, continuous research has to be part of your venture, adds Aryal.
If we dig into the internal challenges of startups, there are problems
like payment default and lack of human resource management. “In Nepal,
the payment settlement process is very slow. If any corporate house or
any client takes the service, they pay only after three months. Many
companies also suﬀer due to payment default,” says Joshi. Besides this,
lack of clarity in roles, responsibilities and remuneration of staﬀis
another reason increasing the chance of failure.

A cultural change in terms of entrepreneurship is gradually developing
here. But still, people coming from elite and upper-class groups are
winning the game.Their wealth and social networks allow them space to
sustain longer in the ecosystem, though their products fail.The
middle-class and the lower section have to ﬁrst take care of their
household expenses on top of everything. “Entrepreneurship is more of a
class game,” expresses Ashutosh Tiwari. One of the major reasons for
this sort of failure is because of limited ﬁnance options. Though banks
claim to support startups, in reality, most entrepreneurs face
challenges in terms of getting a loan. “It has already been 8 years
since I started the venture. But still, banks want collateral if I ask
for a loan,” says Ashish Adhikari, co-founder of Red Mud Coﬀee.

Ayushi KC, founder of Khalisisi says that Nepal lacks angel investors
who want to invest in good ideas. “There are people with money. But they
don’t want to risk investing in a startup,” says KC. Startups also often
ignore business compliance being unaware of the laws. “It is very
important for founders to understand about tax, vat and other
compliances,” says Bikaram Prajapati, founder and CEO, Bajra Brick and
Tile Industries which manufactures environment-friendly bricks. On one
hand, the stakeholders don’t communicate enough about the importance of
compliance and on the other hand, even founders overlook the study they
need to do to meet the compliance. Deependra Chaulagain shares the
necessity to learn about compliance, especially in Nepal. “There is a
lack of clarity in the legal provision of Nepal.

As there are many loopholes in the act, the government can order to
close down a number of companies anytime. So, we should at least have a
basic knowledge of the rules and regulations,” says Chaulagain. Devkota
says that the startups themselves should be proactive in taking advice
and recommendations from company registration oﬃces and lawyers. “In a
developed market, lawyers charge fees to give suggestions and
information. But here everything is free. Startups should take the
beneﬁt of the new market,” thinks Devkota. Challenges in Mentorship As
the government has gradually started appreciating the startups and many
youths are coming forward with an entrepreneurial mind-set, stakeholders
in the startup ecosystem stress on the importance of good mentorship for
success.The rise in the number of people willing to help startups is
signiﬁcant compared to ﬁve years ago. Experts and entrepreneurs,
however, view that the number of mentors is not enough for the rising
number of ideas.

According to Ashish Adhikari, industry-speciﬁc mentors are needed at the
moment. “Entrepreneurs need to be guided by someone who has faced
similar kinds of problems. My ideal mentors would be seniors from the
hospitality sector like Karna Shakya and Shyam Kakshyapati. But I have
never got an opportunity to interact with them,” says Adhikari. Experts
say that mentors are like therapists who listen to you and help identify
your problems. Good mentors listen to ideas actively and engage in ways
to convert the idea into reality. “Mentors need to keep questioning.The
right mentors keep questioning you till you don’t get to the core of
your ideas,” says Narottam Aryal. But according to Aryal most of the
mentors here think that they should give suggestions and solutions for
problems, which is not mentorship. Right mentorship is not just about
ﬁnding a solution to problems in business, but it is also sharing the
personal journey of the entrepreneur. However, in the context of Nepal,
Suman Shakya observes that the market lacks experienced mentors. “Right
mentors come with an experience of 20 to 25 years which can help the
entrepreneurs to ﬁgure out their direction for their venture,” says
Shakya. “But here, people with very less experience are also coming
forward as mentors.” Experts say that right mentors can only contribute
to making the market mature.

Also, they say that even the entrepreneurs here are not ready to learn
and be open when it comes to mentorship. “There is less awareness about
the importance of mentorship, training and development,” says Niranjan
Shrestha. Similarly, Shabda Gyawali, investment director at Dolma Impact
Fund opines that the lack of a proper support system is a challenge for
many innovative youths. “Nepal has ideas, but to entreprenereulise it,
we need to scale, a ﬁnance model should be clear and we need the
know-how.There is no support system to give that knowledge to startups,”
he says. In developed markets, the diﬀerence between a mentor and
consultant diﬀers based on their roles and responsibilities. While
consultants work on a speciﬁc agenda and charge speciﬁc fees, mentorship
is more about sharing a business journey where the agendas are not
speciﬁc. Mentorship is usually based on a mutual interest in a
particular venture. However, Nepal being a very new market for startups,
these concepts are still not clear in the ecosystem. Nemaphuki believes
that mentorship has to be made more systematic. “If we are going to take
mentorship sessions, we usually have no idea about the fees they will
charge. Sometimes, mentors charge exorbitantly high fees.

And sometimes they don’t charge at all,” says Nemaphuki, adding, “If we
could set a certain structure in mentoring, it would be convenient for
us.” Entrepreneurs expect conﬁdentiality from mentors. When a mentor is
reliable, the mentee can openly discuss their ideas and challenges.
While this is eﬀectively practised in developed markets, Nepal is still
on the way to achieve this professionalism. Nemaphuki confesses that
mentors don’t necessarily follow this ethic in Nepal. “This is the
reason, we hesitate to share our ideas and problems,” she says.
Deependra Chaulagain agrees and adds, “The trust factor is still lacking
in the mentormentee relationship in the startup ecosystem in Nepal.”
Similarly, Niranjan Shrestha says, “People with innovative business
ideas don’t usually come up front due to their fears that their ideas
will be copied by others who have ﬁnancial and other resources.” Signs
of Growth Outside Kathmandu While the growth has been exciting in the
capital, cities outside the valley are also getting exposure to various
aspects of the startup culture due to seed camps and incubators that are
getting started in diﬀerent parts of the country. Entrepreneurship
groups like E4N, NEHUB, and NYEF have their chapters and regularly
organise interaction in cities including Biratnagar and Pokhara. Next
Venture Corp, Nepal Communitere, Antarprerana and Idea Studio mentor the
diverse youth from diﬀerent places of Nepal. In Nepal, where potential
investors even in Kathmandu hesitate to invest in ideas, it looks like a
faraway dream for investors to support ideas in other areas.

According to the facilitators, the ideas and passion among the youth are
amazing in all the districts they have been to. “What lacks is the
stakeholders’ willingness to support the ideators,” says Binay Devkota.
Kathmandu has been experiencing a burst of idea pitches and several
failures. But the rest of Nepal has been hearing about the growth of
startups from social media and news. “Due to this, the youth there has a
good idea about the various concept of startups, however, they don’t
have a role model whom they can follow,” says Devkota from Clock B
Business Innovation. Clock B Business Innovation has been organising
various interaction and mentorship sessions with entrepreneurs in
Nepalgunj, Hetauda, Chitwan, Pokhara, Biratnagar and Tulsipur. Shakya
says that entrepreneurs outside the valley frequent meet-ups and
orientation classes regarding the holistic aspects of startups. “As the
youth are highly interested, with the right guidance and mentorship, the
ecosystem will see good growth in a few years,” says Shakya from NEHUB.
NEHUB had organised a Startup Weekend session in Pokhara. Joshi of Next
Venture Corp observes that places like Pokhara can come up with
innovative ideas relating to tourism. Similarly, Devkota says that
entrepreneurs in areas like Dang have potential to come up with
agri-tech ideas.

According to Khanal of R&amp;D Innovative Solution, most entrepreneurs
are working to bring innovation in their family business and also trying
to create some technology to solve their community’s problems.

Antarprenerana has been organising mentorship sessions collaborating
with various colleges and district chambers of commerce in Nepalgunj,
Chitwan, Birgunj, Hetauda and Biratnagar.

According to Khanal, unlike traditional businesses, the new ventures and
ideas, especially outside the valley, are prioritising social
responsibility and problem solving rather than just proﬁt.

All the facilitators and experts view that local support is essential to
create a startup-friendly ecosystem in the areas. Investment Scenario
People from developed countries invest more in ideas whereas people in
the least developed countries invest in properties.The latter invest
very little in research; therefore the citizens hardly understand the
advantages of investing in innovative ideas. People in Nepal mostly
invest in gold and real estate. However, there are very few people
willing to invest in innovative ventures. But there are good reasons as
to why they are not interested. Firstly, startups are in a nascent
stage. Thousands of ideas are pitched every year but very few of them
convert into businesses.

And most of which are converted don’t have a long term vision. Even
those who have invested in a startup are not willing to go for the next
investment. “There are many such examples where the investors did not
get the expected return from startups.

Also, there are instances where the startup moved to implement the
project and eventually returned the fund,” says Devkota. Both
entrepreneurs and investors do very less research before investing. Many
entrepreneurs have no idea about their plans after getting the
investment.There are also a few investors who invest without studying
the company’s nature. “Investing in a startup is all about
uncertainties, so investors should be well prepared before they decide
to invest,” says Devkota. Running a startup is about solving problems in
innovative ways. However, it takes a lot of research and time to
identify the core problems in the market. So, experts suggest not taking
an investment in the initial phase. “It is good to start with savings or
getting a loan from family when you begin,” says Aryal. Similarly,
Khanal shares that investors are interested only when the startup starts
making a customer base. Experts also observe a lack of communication
between founders and investors as one of the reasons that contribute to
the misunderstanding. “Many founders in Nepal don’t care about updating
the investors with what is going on in their companies,” says Tiwari.
Observing the market trend, we found that the companies that receive
investment are highly appreciated. Some of them get media hype and the
market categorises them as successful ventures. This is an achievement
because it shows that the venture has made an impact on the market, but
many don’t realise that with investment comes responsibility. “After the
pledge, it takes a lot of time to realise the investment. Over time,
companies need to invest their own money to set up the infrastructure as
required by the investors,” says Nemaphuki. She adds that investment
pledges can also roll back at any moment if they are not satisﬁed with
the founders’ system in due course of time. Entrepreneurs need to
prepare themselves for all these challenges before deciding to seek
investors for their venture, she shares.The investment ﬁrms share that
there is a gap between investors and good companies. “There are many
companies which have been making an impact in the market and society for
many years. But they have no idea about the presence of alternative
ﬁnance platforms in Nepal,” says Kavi Raj Joshi.

Aryal echoes Joshi on this point.

According to investment ﬁrms, venture capitalists are interested in
ventures which have gained market traction and have proved that they can
sustain. “There are a lot of players out there who are doing cut and
paste - there is nothing novel about the idea,” says Pandey. “Then there
are certain ideas that the entrepreneur has bootstrapped and used his
own money and time with a group of people to bring it to a certain
level. That’s where venture capital private equity people will be more
interested to seriously look into because that’s indicative of not just
passion, but there’s a demonstrable ﬁnancial capacity that has been
proven by taking it to that level,” he adds. Gyawali of Dolma Impact
Fund shares that they invested in Sastodeal after studying the
opportunity in the retail market.They decided that the trend of online
shopping will gradually increase in Nepal as mobile penetration is very
high. With the investment, the plan is to strengthen the software and
logistics part of the venture. Similarly, Foodmandu, which received its
second round of investment from Team Ventures, had raised its ﬁrst round
of investment from True North Associates.The company was doing 100
deliveries a day when it received its series one funding but the daily
deliveries reached 1,000 when the company received series two funding.
Foodmandu invested in Oﬃce infrastructure, strengthened its human
resources and logistics after it received the ﬁrst-round investment.
With the second round, Foodmandu is planning to do geographical
expansion and invest in human resources. “A company like ours needs high
expenses to upgrade. So, this is an opportunity for us to expand and
upgrade,” says Adhikari.

Adhikari says that the venture has made a partial exit to True North
Associates and the Team Ventures has bought their share as well. Policy
Intervention Due to a lack of policy, players in the startup ecosystem
face interruption from the government time and again. From the
government’s order to stop ridesharing ventures to controlling social
media advertisements, the lack of clarity in policy has been troubling
innovative entrepreneurs. “In terms of the policy level, what is
happening with companies like Pathao and Tootle right now is totally
against any sort of development towards allowing the future of startups.
Regulations should follow innovation, not the other way around.
Innovation is being stunted by regulation,” says Pandey. “The policy has
not even deﬁned small and medium industries (SMEs). Startups are still a
new concept,” says Suman Shakya. He urges the government to deﬁne these
terms so that the entrepreneurs and other stakeholders are clear when
they work. Though concepts like challenge fund, seed fund, tax exemption
are mentioned in the budget, due to a lack of policy, the decisions are
not implemented.

According to Niranjan Shrestha, the policy initiatives of the last
couple of years indicate that the government has started to realise the
importance of startup companies. “First, it should accept the fact that
viable business ideas come from innovative thoughts. Second, the
government needs to recognise the role of incubators and business
accelerators in the startup ecosystem. Third, the policies should also
incorporate the role of alternative ﬁnancing sources such as PE, VC and
angel investors. Overall, there should be a higher degree of acceptance
of all these aspects from the government’s side,” says Shrestha.The
stakeholders in the ecosystem urge the government to build proper
infrastructure rather than distributing funds to the startups and the
aspiring youth. “At the moment, we need the right set of policies to
foster the entrepreneurial environment in the country,” says Shrestha.

Another major issue raised by the entrepreneurs is on the limitation set
on FDI. In a market where people are not yet ready to invest in
startups, entrepreneurs think that allowing foreign investors would help
a lot in their growth. However, the threshold of a minimum of Rs 50
million foreign investment has limited many startups and scaled-up
ventures from growth. “We were almost ready to secure second round
investment from Dutch investors in 2019, but amid the process, the
policies were changed overnight,” says Adhikari. Such abrupt decisions
have been disappointing, shares Adhikari. Investors and experts say that
the government is limiting the growth of many potential ventures.

Ashutosh Tiwari opined the government hasn’t yet looked at the picture
of startups and SMEs. “For instance, the government says that a small
momo shop doesn’t need foreign investment. But it misses the point that
the momo shop will become a chain restaurant if it gets investment to
improve its service,” says Tiwari. “Foreign investment not only brings
funds but also gives us knowledge about an eﬃcient operation, ﬁnancial
know-how and new ideas,” he shares. Experts say that there is space for
a lot of innovation in Nepal. Nepal hasn’t seen many amazing startups
yet, so more youths should come into the ecosystem, they say. While they
urge the youth to focus on research and to bring ideas that can bring
solutions to the problems in Nepal, they also suggest startups to aim to
go beyond the market of Nepal.

Apart from China and India, investors, accelerators and mentors urge
startups to work to expand in markets similar to Nepal such as
Bangladesh and Africa.

Startup Mantra: Need collective efforts to push Brand Pune

Body

India, Dec. 31 -- It is that time of the year when we take stock of the
startup ecosystem in the city. While we would party hard tonight and
welcome the new year with hope, love and happiness, there is a stark
reality of the entrepreneurial world that Pune startup founders and
native business families must address in the new year. With a lot of
IPOs, M&As, funding rounds in 2022, Pune has seen individual success and
brilliance but at the same time, lack of positioning the city as a
'brand' collectively in the past decade has raised serious doubts about
our ability to stay ahead in the race. If 'Brand Pune' must beat
Bengaluru or Delhi startup hubs, the stakeholders should get their act
together to set up native venture capital firms, create more networking
opportunities and create startup leadership talent.

Overview

According to Amit Chitale, a business leader who closely observes the
Pune startup ecosystem, "Pune has largely three types of startups.
"First category is of those solving very deep problem statements who
become immediately visible to larger organisations for their far horizon
strategies and who get quick traction in terms of M&A for them. The
second category is probably following a more conventional path, not
looking for early exits, building and becoming big players in their
respective domains. These may become the catalyst for the next wave of
entrepreneurs. They have a very long-term future for Pune and industry
and they are seeing good traction universally."

"The third category is of startups who have survived and sustained. They
picked up good problem statements, but their industry itself was very
sluggish having its own inertia. These startups have been around, but
you do not see them making big noise. They are following conventional
company build-up approaches," added Amit.

Bhavik Vasa, founder of GetVantage, a revenue-based financing platform
which has funded over ten startups from Pune, feels Pune is rapidly
evolving as a startup hub and will be home to many more IPO-bound
companies in the coming years.

"The state's startup policies are favourable for both founders and
investors," says Bhavik.

Mahaveer Muttha, startup mentor and Google Developer Group Pune
Organiser, said, "Pune is standing at the 4th position in India and 90th
position globally when we talk about the startup ecosystem. Being an
automobile, and educational hub, along with large setups of industries
in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), manufacturing, and real estate and
one of the best places to stay in the country, Pune is becoming the
first choice for startup founders. There are more than 3,000 registered
companies in Pune and hundreds of them have received million-dollar
funding so far. Eight unicorns out of 108 from the country are from Pune
and plenty of startups who are on the edge to becoming unicorns."

Leadership talent

Sandeep Saxena, vice-president (revenue) at drivebuddy AI, says,
"Ecosystem is created by wealthy people because when you have wealth, it
becomes easy to start creating bigger ventures. We have very few such
examples in Pune and hence we are not on par with Bengaluru or Delhi.
Third-generation entrepreneurs in the city are creating traditional
businesses since they are risk-averse and carry cultural baggage. Cities
like Indore, Noida, and Ahmedabad, which were behind Pune, may overtake
and dislodge us from the top five spots soon."

Bharat Oswal, CII Young Indians Yuva Pune Chair, says, "Colleges and
universities in the Indian context are always looked upon as placement
agencies. This is the core problem in our existing education ecosystem.
Our focus must shift more towards creating an ecosystem which makes
students think, experiment and fail fast. Entrepreneurship will be built
if we create the right culture of problem-solving and sync it with what
the industry demands which eventually can convert into a potential
business opportunity."

Culture building

Vishal Kulkarni, a business growth strategist says, "The year 2022 has
seen a big upscale movement for startups. Out of entire startups
registered in Maharashtra, 64 per cent are registered in Mumbai and Pune
alone. While we analyse the success and failures of Pune startups, we
must acknowledge that an excellent product supported by good funding
should have served as a 'winning formula' but unfortunately, very few
startups have managed to scale up businesses."

"An excellent product with good funding is the brighter side of the
coin, whereas lack of focus on the right 'culture building' is the
darker side. Organisational culture is the foundation for successful
scaling of startups. For new-age entrepreneurs to succeed in scaling up
their companies, they must shift focus from an individual-driven
organisation approach to a process-driven organisation," says Vishal.

Culture values for entrepreneurship

Satish Patil, an entrepreneur with a successful exit, said, "Pune's
startup universe has taken a super high grade since last few years. Pune
startups have been vocal about their 'core values,' but creating a
strong culture is a journey, not a destination. Startups may not get
everything right, but continued focus, investment, and iteration is
needed to see progress in this area. One important area to focus on
could be prioritising diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). DEI is
both an essential aspect of company values as well as a contributor to
company performance. Research shows that companies with racial, gender
and ethnic diversity are more profitable than their peers. Hopefully, we
will see more sustained efforts in Pune startup ecosystem in the DEI
space in 2023."

Highlighting the importance of 'relationship intelligence' for startups
wanting to scale up, Satish said, "Working in a primarily digital
environment in the post-Covid time requires technology to play a new,
outsized role in facilitating relationship management. People now rely
on their virtual networking skills to get the job done, even as they
fall back on people they knew before the pandemic. This networking is
supported by relationship intelligence - the insight into your team's
network, business relationships, and customer interactions."

Scaling up

Nikita Vora, a digital marketing trainer focussing especially on solo
women solopreneurs says, "Women entrepreneurs have limited time and
resources to devote to marketing efforts. While working with Pune
entrepreneurial community closely, we observe some common mistakes made
by startup founders. These include failing to define a clear target
market, not having a solid marketing plan, underestimating the
importance of customer feedback, and not adapting to changing market
conditions."

"Marketing automation can help them streamline marketing tasks, improve
customer engagement, boost lead generation, and enhance personalisation
in marketing efforts by segmenting audiences and targeting specific
groups with customised messaging and content, added Nikita.

Future trends: Web3, blockchain startups

Shrikant Bhalerao, cofounder of Seracle, said, "While there is wider
regional recognition of the Web3 space, the city still lacks a
well-defined talent pool and access to networking opportunities. A
well-developed talent pool is needed to find qualified and experienced
personnel who can help develop and grow the business. It is essential to
support the development of industry-specific talent by investing in
educational programmes, such as hackathons, coding boot camps, and other
skill development forms."

"Additionally, access to funds is another pressing issue. As Pune is
still relatively new and uncharted territory for most investors and
venture capitalists, it can take time to get funding. This issue can be
addressed by concerted efforts like establishing incubators and
accelerators for startups to create a space that can attract and nurture
talent. This will enable support like access to mentors, grants, and
other financial resources," said Shrikant.

Polestar built a better car than Tesla; now it needs to build a better
brand

September 18 -- Polestar is a startup in an unusual situation. Polestar
has the car. It has the executives. Polestar has factories, partners and
distribution channels. It's set for success in a way most startups are
not. And yet, success is not guaranteed. I fear Polestar is missing a
critical aspect of electric vehicles and selling against Tesla.

I anticipate this will be a crucial point of discussion with Polestar
CEO Thomas Ingenlath at TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility. We're excited to
have Ingenlath join the event for a fireside chat on the company and
electric vehicles' future.

Over the past few weeks, I've driven both of Polestar's vehicles and
attended briefings. I've learned about their roll-out plan, target
demographics and countless technical details about the company's
$155,000 hybrid coupe (full review) and $60,000 electric sedan (first
drive review). It's a fascinating company that built two world-class
vehicles able to stand tall against anything from Tesla, Mercedes or
BMW.

But Polestar is missing the Tesla factor, and I fear sales will lag
because of it.

Polestar is seemingly following a similar product cycle as Tesla by
offering a limited-run super sports car followed by more affordable
family cars. The Polestar 1 is the company's Tesla Roadster while the
Polestar 2 is its Tesla Model S.

 

I noted this similarity in my write-up about the fantastic Polestar 1
hybrid grand tourer. The large coupe is superb, with excellent driving
characteristics and top-notch fit and finish. The Polestar 1 does not
feel like the first vehicle from a startup. Compare the Polestar 1 to an
early Tesla Roadster (or even current Model 3), and the differences are
profound. The Polestar 1 looks and feels as good as anything from
Mercedes or BMW, and better than any Tesla model.

And yet, fit and finish is not enough to sell against Tesla because
Tesla created a practical and exciting ecosystem around its vehicles.

It starts with Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who alone has a social media
presence many multiples larger than Polestar's. With a charismatic
leader at the helm, consumers are more likely to pay attention. What's
more, Elon Musk frequently responds and interacts with Tesla owners on
Twitter. Love him or hate him, Elon Musk is the world's best car
salesman.

Polestar's social media presence is small. Instagram seems to be its
largest channel as its posted 1,366 items to its 356,000 followers. On
Facebook, Polestar has 461,000 followers, but the company hasn't posted
any pictures, stories or posts. YouTube is more of the same where
Polestar only has 40,000 subscribers instead of Tesla's 1.4 million.

The lack of social outreach seems antiquated and short-sighted; we'll
talk about this at the Mobility event.

Polestar CEO Ingenlath seems different from Elon Musk in several
critical aspects. He's measured and focused and appears to be piloting
Polestar more like a traditional automaker than a free-wheeling
startup - that's likely due to his past positions inside Volvo and
Volkswagen Group. He joined Volvo in 2012 and became the CEO of the
Polestar subsidiary in 2017. Before Volvo, he was the chief exterior
designer for Volkswagen, chief designer at Skoda, and finally, the
director of Design at the Volkswagen Design Center.

Polestar is technically an OEM like BMW or General Motors. The company
was spun out of Volvo, where it was previously a performance division
akin to Mercedes Benz' AMG division. In 2017 Volvo and Geely (which owns
Volvo) spun Polestar out of the fold, although Polestar still retains
relationships with both of its parents.

 

Being an OEM means it's more on its own to chart its path to success or
failure. As a startup, Polestar faces the same challenges as other
startups, most notably other young automotive companies like Tesla,
Rivian or Nio.

In an August call with Polestar, CEO Thomas Ingenlath talked about the
company's retail plans. Unlike Tesla, Polestar vehicles will only be
sold through partnerships with dealerships. Polestar vehicles will not
be sold directly to consumers. Ingenlath said the company is working
with existing Volvo dealerships though the company has fielded outreach
from BMW, Mercedes and other dealerships looking to sell Polestar
vehicles.

Using existing dealership relationships, Polestar quickly spun up a
dealer and service network, while bypassing the trouble Tesla often
faces in states with dealership laws.

Polestar also intends to use existing dealerships to build showcase
retail locations in high-traffic areas similar to those produced by
Tesla. Will shoppers still have to haggle with a dealership salesperson
when buying a Polestar vehicle? It's unclear, and it's likely some
potential buyers will be turned off by the thought of having to use a
dealership for sales and service.

The electric vehicle scene is quickly growing up, and Polestar's
positioning puts it in an unusually mature situation ahead of other
similarly aged startups.

It's thrilling to have Thomas Ingenlath speak at TC Sessions: Mobility.
As outlined above, there are plenty of topics to discuss. Ingenloth is
the latest in our all-star lineup of speakers, including Bryan Salesky,
co-founder and CEO of Argo AI; Klaus Zellmer, president and CEO of
Porsche Cars North America; and Tekedra Mawakana, chief operating
officer at Waymo.

We hope you can join in October 6-7, 2020 at the event. For the first
time, TC Sessions: Mobility is a virtual event, and we've built
incredible features into our platform to give attendees unparalleled
access to speakers, investors and fellow founders. Get a ticket here.

[Matrix Moments] Costs can be controlled; revenue can't, says Avnish
Bajaj, Matrix Partners India

A critical factor that determines an early-stage startup's success or
failure is the level of spending, or burn rate. Practising extreme
financial discipline is a criticalpart of controlling your company's
burn rate.

Avnish Bajaj, Founder and Managing Director, Matrix Partners India,
believes when it comes to VC investing, people are "essentially trying
to underwrite the future".

"Inherently, there is ambiguityby definition becauseit's very hard to
know the future, and especially if you are trying to do very disruptive
things," he says.

Avnish adds that a plan is a convergence between the founder the
investor is backing and the investor's view of the future. How does it
work? As a venture capitalist, "you would have some form of an
investment memo", which delineates what success would look like. And so,
it provides the markers for that success.

The different kinds of contracts

"In my view, when a founder and an investor get into a relationship,
they are in some ways signing multiple contracts without signing them.
One obvious contract is a legal contract. In my view, that's probably
used the least.They are also signing up for a moral contract, which
centres on what people expect from each other. And frankly, at Matrix,
we do spend time talking about those expectations," Avnish says.

The third contract is the plan, the performance contract. Avnish says
that may not be something people spend a lot of time on, especially in
the early stages of the business.

"What people actually track is do you have a common understanding of
what success would look like," he says.

But how does one work around plans and burn rates?

Citing the example of Baazee, Avnish says initially they didn't have a
market so they managed the cost till they were able to get some version
of product-marketfit.

"And therefore, we managed to have a business that overa period of
timebecame more sustainable. I don't think people in India in the
ecosystem, be it investors or founders, think through burn rates
carefully," Avnish says.

Costs can be controlled, not revenue

In the early stages, the things you control are the costs, not the
revenue. This is because different factors come into the picture with
revenue: product-market fit, right users, will it grow without
marketing, monetisation, and others.

Costs, on the other hand, don't depend on such factors. Rent is a cost,
as are employees. Thus, costs are certain, revenues are not.

"Most often, people guide the founders to say raise money for 18 to 24
months. Now, that's a good principle. But, I think a better principle is
to raise money for 18 to 24 months, but - if things are going well -
actually raisemore money in 9 to 12 months. If things are not going
well, you should be thinking about 36 to 48 months, three to four years.
Buy more time, control your destiny," Avnish says.

How do you do that if the input money is fixed? The only way to control
your destiny is with burn rates.

Keep an eye on the burn rate

It is vital to put a plan in place and be extremely disciplined on the
burn rate because beyond a point you cannot control product-market fit.

"If you are an early-stage founder, you are probably raising $1.5
million at a seed stage. I tell the founders to keep very clear markers
for a Rs 30 lakh, Rs 50 lakh, and Rs 70 lakh a month burn rate. Don't
spend on marketing until you have product-market fit. Marketing is not
the way to get product-market fit. If you were to do this kind of a
math,by definition youwould have money for 18 to 24 months with the
amount that you have raised," Avnish says.

Once that is under control, start thinking of revenue greater than your
burn rate. So if a startup is burning Rs 1 crore a month, how far is it
from having revenue of Rs 1 crore a month? This is the first marker, he
says, and clarifies that this will be net revenue and not GMV.

"If you look at the financial architecture of a business, one of the
early markers of progress is financial health," Avnish says.

The next step is to look at your unit economics. Does the gross margin
pay for the marketing cost?

"Normally people say 'is your gross margin going to cover your fixed
cost?' Because then I can pay for marketing. Butif you are in a
high-growth environment, you will always need to market. Gross margin
covering marketing means youare able topay for your growth. If youare
able topay for growth, with more growth, your fixed cost will get
covered and you will become profitable," Avnish says.

Plan and track your burn rate

A plan is a disciplined month-on-month exercise and can help you
determine how far you are getting from the 18 to 24 months runway. If
the burn is high, you need to figure out how to extend the runway.

"I tell founders if they are able to keep a perpetual 18- to 24-month
runway, they are going to become profitable at some point. Ifnot, take
the time to hunker down, fix thebasics, and getback on the trajectory of
the burn rate," Avnish says.

Typically, if businesses are not tracking this, it may take them a
year-and-a-half to two years before they getback on track.

"If we are in the business of backing people based on the future, we
need to see how good they are in predicting the future and managing
towards it. That is what a plan tells me. So my one-line summary of why
performance versus plan matters is that a plan a measure of how good the
founder is at understanding the market,the competition, execution,
predicting the future, and looking backwards," Avnish says.

Rounds that matter: Fintech's fortunes, DAO dreams, Asia's reseller
revival

Keeping up with the latest technology money moves

Despite the slowdown in venture capital activity, there's still a
mountain of money flowing through startups today. TechCrunch+ is
launching a series of posts looking at recent, notable venture rounds,
exit activity and other news that relates to the financial side of
building new technology companies.

While banks are dealing with the crisis kicked off by the failure of
well-known, startup-friendly Silicon Valley Bank, upstart tech companies
are still more than busy raising capital. They're also looking for
exits. More former than the latter, given the frozen IPO market . But
while we wait for the reawakening of a key exit point for startups, we
can still keep tabs on where and how the money is flowing into their
world.

Remarkable rounds of the week

Etoro reloads at $3.5B valuation

-   After its SPAC deal failed to consummate, consumer trading service
    eToro was left without an expected new tranche of capital and a new
    valuation mark. However, it had previously secured a pledge for new
    funds if its SPAC deal fell through, capital that it has now raised.

1.  The round matters for its size (nine figures), industry (fintech has
    taken a valuation pounding in recent quarters) and underlying
    financial results. Despite posting some growth since 2020 in 2022,
    the company shrank compared to the 2021 period last year. This means
    that we're seeing a massive, consumer-fintech company set a new
    valuation under difficult conditions. Fintech founders should take
    note.

Seed Club Ventures sneaks out of stealth with $25M to make DAO dreams a
reality

-   A lot of people assumed interest in DAOs, or decentralized
    autonomous organizations, had faded in the past year along with
    crypto bros' fortunes. But it turns out there are still a number of
    people very invested in the concept of communities making their own
    decisions on how to spend millions of dollars.

1.  Seed Club Ventures, a 63-member consortium of VCs, individual
    investors, family offices and various entities that still believe in
    web3, recently came out of stealth with a $25 million fund to help
    DAOs do just that.

1.  This matters because that $25 million is going to go to really
    early-stage projects building much-needed tooling for DAOs. It has
    already backed projects like Guild, Stability AI, Lens and
    Metalabel. Such tooling will actually help take DAOs to a level
    where they can realize some, if not all, of the potential that fully
    decentralized systems bring.

IntegrityNext raises $109M to help companies ensure their supply chain
is ESG-compliant

-   There's a lot of politics around environmental, social and
    governance (ESG) investing policies for good reason: Compliance with
    ESG norms requires companies to examine the breadth and depth of
    their operations to ensure things are done responsibly. That can get
    expensive, tedious and take a really long time.

1.  Munich-based IntegrityNext is doing something very special to help
    companies solve that problem: It helps companies audit their supply
    chains so they can quickly find out where and how they can optimize
    the supply chain and comply with ESG requirements.

1.  This fundraise is really good news for European companies, because
    they will have an easier time of adopting previously "nice-to-have"
    ESG policies that are soon becoming "must-have" as regulations in
    the EU tighten up.

Kream rushes to a $742M valuation because fashion nerds like the
circular economy

-   In a world of abundance, some things are rare, which is why reseller
    platforms for luxury goods exist. Spun out of Korean e-commerce
    giant Naver, Kream has only been around for two years, but the
    company has seen incredible success as fashion-savvy customers
    flooded its store, looking for high-end, rare sneakers, watches,
    bags, accessories and clothing.

1.  Kream's $168 million fundraise is interesting because the company is
    going to invest a lot in its peers to build a reseller network
    spanning a large swath of Asia - meaning someone in Japan can buy
    limited edition sneakers that were only launched in Japan.

1.  It's also great news for Asia's growing reselling market, as it
    signals consumer interest in collectibles and other luxury items,
    which could drive further investment in this space.

Kredivo raises gigantic $270M Series D to make credit more accessible
for underbanked Asians

-   It's no secret that the massive underbanked population in Asia's
    developing economies is a big market for fintech to disrupt, and
    Kredivo, which aims to increase access to credit in Indonesia and
    Vietnam, has certainly struck gold with a user base that's about as
    big as Indonesia's credit-card-holding population.

1.  The company's oversubscribed $270 million Series D is proof of the
    fact that there's growth to be had in making people's lives easier
    and helping them get access to banking services easily and
    seamlessly.

Other startup and venture capital news

The venture slowdown is slowing down even the fastest startup categories

-   It's a sad reality of the world that even diamonds at times have no
    takers, and that seems to be panning out right now in startup land:
    Even previously hot API startups are suffering in the venture
    slowdown.

1.  Per data from GGV, which tracks funding into 63 API companies,
    startups in this category raised about $2.15 billion in 2022, less
    than half of what they raised a year earlier. Deal counts have also
    been down. Q4 2022 saw such startups raising a paltry $134 million,
    which is lower than in the year's previous three quarters. That's
    got to be tough.

1.  We care about this because even though API startups are leading the
    charge with usage-based pricing models, which is arguably the future
    of software sales, they're still subject to wider market pressures.
    Their struggle indicates that no matter how hot a sector you're in,
    dollars are likely to be increasingly harder to come by.

Coinbase execs are angry at the SEC raining on their parade

-   The crypto world isn't happy with how lawmakers are treating it.
    Coinbase's CEO recently pretty much said the government should just
    make up its mind about regulations already after the SEC sent it a
    Wells notice, which basically means the government is going to come
    after Coinbase and companies like it for "violations of the federal
    securities laws."

1.  We sorta agree with Coinbase here: There really isn't much precedent
    for what the crypto world is going through, and fitting the SEC's
    nearly century-old laws to the crypto economy feels very much like a
    square-peg-triangle-hole situation.

1.  It's clear the SEC needs to really cement its beliefs on how crypto
    should be traded so that the wider ecosystem can just follow the
    rules.

Roofstock cuts 27% of staff in second round of layoffs

-   Proptech startups are having a moment, and their employees seem to
    be paying for it. Rising mortgage rates and the general housing
    slowdown haven't been good for companies that depended on people
    realizing their American dream.

1.  But buying a house in this economy? A lot of people basically said,
    "yeah, right," which basically led to Roofstock, which lets people
    buy and sell rental homes in dozens of U.S. markets, deciding that
    it needs to lay off 27% of its staff for the second time in less
    than two quarters.

1.  The company's trying to stay afloat in a sinking housing market,
    which makes sense, but what doesn't is that it was valued at $1.9
    billion just a year ago. This isn't good news for the wider proptech
    market right now.

4 Indian investors explain how their investment strategy has changed
since 2021

-   Indian startups started 2022 with a pretty good outlook since the
    global venture slowdown hadn't gotten to the country yet. But arrive
    it did, leading to a 70% drop in funding in the second half of the
    year.

1.  While we're sure investors in the country saw it coming, how did
    they recalibrate their sensors to the new climate? After polling a
    few investors, Jagmeet found out that for starters, they slowed way
    down, choosing to make safer bets and generally making sure their
    portfolio companies have enough runway to last for however long this
    downturn is going to take.

1.  Indian investors are also telling their startups to take a step
    back, solidify their business models and focus on the basics to get
    to the next milestone. And if needed, raise a down round, because
    life> death.

When the tech IPO market reopens, keep an eye on HR unicorns

-   Do you hear that? That's Alex giggling in excited expectation of all
    the S-1s we're likely to get if HR unicorns continue to grow as
    quickly as they have.

1.  The startup group's ARR growth and regular EBITDA output - and
    therefore, valuations - seem to be nearly immune to the slowdown as
    unicorns like Deel, Velocity Global, Gusto and Ripple continue to
    grow into new markets and categories.

1.  This means that come IPO season, HR tech companies are going to
    likely be among the first out of the gate. We're curious about one
    thing though: How long can the startups in question grow without
    going to war with each other, perhaps in the form of price cuts?

Startup Shrugs

Section: PRE-BUDGET SPECIAL

Length: 854 words

Byline: Rahul Sachitanand

Body

On February 1, when businesspeople across the country will be tracking
every word of the Union Budget, Manish Kumar wont bother much about it.
The founder of fintech startup GREX and convener of industry lobby
Fintech Forum, he will instead be finalising the adoption of a girl
child. Startups dont have much to look forward to in the budget, says
Kumar. An entrepreneurs life is a difficult, busy one, and the budget
doesnt matter that much. He is not the only one in the startup ecosystem
giving scant attention to the budget. Entrepreneurs, advisors and
investors are treating February 1 as just another business day, focusing
their energies on managing their budgets rather than parsing what
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley says.

Ritu Srivastava, cofounder of Obino, a health and fitness venture, is
nonchalant about the possibilities of big-bang announcements in the
budget. At a time when her business is growing exponentially, February 1
is a day choc-a-bloc with team meetings, pitches to potential customers,
recruitment interviews and internal budget meetings. For us, it is
business on fire, says Srivastava. Many founders dont look at the budget
in detail, since often they dont understand the intricacies of taxation
well. The implications will come when they come. She stresses that it
isnt about entrepreneurs being ill-informed; it is just a matter of
priorities -- finance heads are left to manage the budget, even as
founders themselves chase business, work on strategy and nail down
funding.

Perhaps naively, startup founders and young executives expect a lot from
the Union budget, says Sasha Mirchandani, CEO of early-stage investment
firm Kae Capital and cofounder of Mumbai Angels. However, history has
been a sober reminder of promises made which have fallen through in the
budget. Instead, he says (and suggests to his portfolio companies) to
focus on the daily grind, with big announcements expected to be made
away from the arc lights of the Union Budget, by Prime Minister Narendra
Modi and FM Jaitley.

Little Expectations

Entrepreneurs believe that the budget belongs to a bygone era, with
little relevance to the small, fast-growing businesses they run. Sachin
Gupta, cofounder of HackerEarth, a global network of 1.5 million
software developers, says one of the reasons startups are apathetic to
the budget is that it rarely has any impact on the type and size of
these businesses. Since startups are a relatively new category for
Finance Ministry mandarins to consider, their specific needs tend to be
ignored. Hardly any measures have been taken for it to be inclusive
(and) the importance of Union budget will continue to decrease.

Little surprise then that early-stage investors are likely to give the
big event a miss. While theres an understandable obsession with the
annual Union budget, in my opinion, this event has little to no bearing
for most young startups, says Amit Somani, managing partner, Prime
Venture Partners. Instead of pondering over the Union budget, I believe,
startups should use this as a timely reminder to focus on their own
budget. His solution, use the Union budget as a base to model your own
financial systems. The core role of a startup CEO/founder is to ensure
that the company never runs out of money, he adds.

Some of this disinterest may stem from tardy implementation of
programmes meant to aid startups. Ujwal Sutaria, founder of Athletto, a
sports tech startup, says he wants to watch the budget and hopes for
some startups sops but given past experience, he has muted expectations.
The government has come up with some amazing initiatives in the past
couple of years, he says. But the implementation has not happened the
way it was publicised. He points to poor disbursal from Fund of Funds
and tax on ESOPs and hurdles to angel investing as hindrances to
startups. I would like to see it, but theres no excitement around the
event.

Siddharth Ladsariya, whose family made a name for itself in the spice
trade, has more recently established himself as a sought-after angel
investor in startups raking up over 100 investments in the past decade.
While he will watch the budget and thinks the startup community can do
with a leg-up, he admits staterun schemes do little to help the
community.

The failure of the startup fund doesnt come as a surprise because
governments arent meant to run startup funds, he says. Instead, he
recommends a slew of measures clarity on angel tax, easing of red tape
and boosting the establishment of incubators and accelerators to
reignite growth in this space. But Ladsariya isnt hopeful of big bang
announcements in the budget. Startups have got a lot of media attention
and a lot of promises have been made. But in reality things are a little
slow with measures such as an angel tax and long-term capital gains
being a big deterrent to growth, he says. Elsewhere, investors are given
incentives to invest. Here it is just the opposite.

Body

The ocean of unlimited capital and an unrelenting bull market is
receding. As the business world catapults into a recession along with
the unknown factor of COVID -19 virus turning life upside down, startups
face a situation that they have not faced in over a decade - a downturn
and lack of capital availability. This moment provides the opportunity
for seasoned VCs to stand up and make a difference in their portfolio
companies.

Good Venture Capitalists can provide assistance to startups in many
significant ways.

Finance

In good times and bad, it is important to understand and optimise the
financial model a startup has. While in the new economy, growth trumps
profitability, it is still important to have a sound revenue model, so
that when the dust of rapid expansion settles, there is great value
created for the founders and investors.

Good VCs, in addition to providing capital to the startup in exchange
for equity, will help founders in making sure that they have sound "unit
economics" - the revenues and costs associated with the basic elements
of the company's business model.

Then there is cash. It is well known that most startups fail because the
founders did not manage cash well. In good times, bad cash management
can spell trouble. In bad times, it can spell disaster.

In the current environment, as a VC and advisor, I would ask my startups
to look at the cash in their bank accounts and evaluate if they have
enough to last them at least 12 months. If not, they need to be
proactive in maximising it by collecting on commitments from investors
and customers as well as drawing down on any available lines of credit
while still available.

If still not optimal, they need to look at cutting costs through
workforce optimisation (layoffs, furloughs, and temporary pay
reductions), renegotiating with all vendors etc.

Operations

Many first-time founders might have outstanding products or services but
lose out through poor execution. VCs can play a big role here as long as
they have a background as an operator.

B2B startups have to execute flawlessly each time they get an
opportunity and it is tough to do so without guidance from someone who
can help navigate the complexities of a large corporation. In fact, most
large firms will not even sign a contract unless the startup can
demonstrate that they have a team which makes a potentially disruptive
installation painless.

Similarly, for B2C startups, creating market awareness about the company
and the product and creating a pleasant user experience is important,
however game-changing the product is.

One of the most basic tenets of great operations are metrics also called
KRAs and tracked using various frameworks such as Kaplan's Balanced
Scorecard. Measuring key aspects of an organisation is essential simply
because we cannot correct something that we do not measure.

Rudimentary yet carefully constructed scorecards can be built with the
help of a VC team that has the experience, and maybe the difference
between success and failure for a startup.

Sales and Marketing

This is where most startups have a lot of trouble. The cash problems
described in the finance section above will not exist and a startup can
get multiple "at-bats" operationally if they have a strong sales and
marketing organisation. Yet invariably, first-time entrepreneurs tend to
underinvest here.

Before they know it, time has passed and they have been unable to
demonstrate great growth in spite of having a fabulous product. Good VCs
can play a strong role in working with the founders and providing them
with toolsets, connections, and guidance to ensure that the spend in
marketing and sales is effective.

In short, good Venture Capital investors can provide a lot more than
just capital. With programmes like "Virtual Co-Founder", early-stage
startups can get assistance in terms of guidance, connections, and
community to make them successful.

The ocean of bountiful growth is receding. Not everyone has the ability
to handle adversity and that will become clear in the months ahead. As
the Oracle of Omaha presciently said, "Only when the tide goes out, do
you discover who's been swimming naked."

How smaller businesses can stave off the job loss epidemic

The UK is Europe's leading startup destination, and ranks fourth
globally in the countries on share of billion dollar startups
(Unicorns), behind the US, China, and India according to the Startup
Index of Nations & Regions from the Center for Global Innovation at the
University of Southern California. 

Despite the growth of unicorns beginning to slow, 2021 proved to be an
exceptional year for startups in the UK, with its ecosystem value
leaping up by nearly 43% - towards $1 trillion (£840 billion) - with
Sifted ranking the UK third worldwide, as its value equalled that of
France, Germany, and Sweden put together.

-   SEE MORE How the cost of living crisis will savage tech

Progressing into 2022, despite the looming global economic crisis and
the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, the UK still saw a YoY growth
of nearly £3bn in the first quarter of this year, compared to Q1 2021,
from investment in UK tech startups. However, signs indicate that UK
investment is starting to slow with funding becoming harder to access.

"The current economic slowdown, which has caused some of the largest
companies in the world like Tesla, Netflix and Uber to announce hiring
freezes and layoffs, will inevitably touch all businesses, large and
small," says Ekaterina Almasque, general partner at European Series at
VC, OpenOcean. "With the cost of doing business high and fears of a
global recession, startups will find VC funding much harder to come by
than previous years."

Job losses on the horizon

Freetrade, the London-based trading platform, recently announced it's
making 15% of its staff redundant, stating the "difficult decision" was
necessary as "global stock markets have been falling and funding for
businesses like ours has slowed". London HQ'd Curve, a digital wallet
aggregator, has made between 60% to 70% of people redundant, with CEO
Shachar Bialick telling Sifted the company had made the decision "with
the aim of putting us in the best possible position for growth in the
second half of the year."

Similarly, London-based casual recruitment platform Stint confirmed that
20% of its 140 employees are at risk of redundancy, Zapp, a UK-based
fast grocery delivery startup, said that it's shedding 10% of staff, and
Cazoo - once one of the highest funded new tech businesses in the UK -
reduced its headcount by 15% in June 2022, impacting 750 jobs across its
UK & EU operations with the termination of its used car markets.

"The combination of rising inflation and interest rates with supply
chain issues caused by the pandemic and war has driven up the cost of
living and hit consumer confidence," says Alex Chesterman, Cazoo's
founder and chief executive. "This perfect storm has placed cash
conservation top of mind for the company, ahead of growth."

This wave of layoffs isn't only occurring in the UK, however, with
companies globally feeling the pinch of slower business growth and
rising labour costs. In November 2022, Stripe - the fintech startup from
Silicon Valley - announced they were reducing their workforce by 14%,
equating to around 1,000 jobs, as a result of the rising energy costs,
higher interest rates, and reduced funding.

To date the Layoffs.fyi tracker indicates that 105,000 people have lost
their jobs at private startups in 2022, with Meta and Twitter making the
most recent headlines. It's a definite warning sign to others, as well
as small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) across the UK, to ensure
that they don't become the next victims.

Funds are drying up

One of the more obvious reasons that companies are reducing their
headcount in 2022 is the rapid rise in energy costs, particularly when
this comes after Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, along with
tax and interest hikes. 

According to the first Simply Business SME Insights Report - an annual
study of the UKs SMBs - nearly 90% have lost a significant amount of
income over the last two years, and one in six says they'll never fully
recover.

"The reason small businesses are likely to suffer in 2022 is due to
their primary source of funds being provided by VC ventures," Samuel
Leach, founder and chief executive of Samuel and Co Trading, tells IT
Pro. "Their dependence on cash from 'raising"' may prove problematic as
the year continues. And as inflation rises, we can see a potential
recession on the horizon, making it less likely for investors, banks,
and financial institutions to part with their capital, no matter the
business's potential. 

2.  SEE MORE Why businesses should invest their way out of a downturn

"The number of deals is projected at 6,904, a 22% drop from the previous
quarter, and the continuing decrease in VC funding and lack of liquidity
is guaranteed to take a further toll on small businesses."

Andy Oury, partner at Oury Clark Chartered Accountants, adds: "The
bubble has burst on cheap endless money. A perfect storm of shocks has
seen VC money somewhat dry up. Of course, the uncertainty is impacting
all businesses, but it's small businesses that face the brunt of it."

Damian Hanson, co-founder & director at CircleLoop, believes that the
shift to hybrid working has also played a part as SMBs and startups
struggle to adapt to the widespread demand for flexibility.
"Unfortunately, though it seems simple in theory, implementing this
hybrid working to the benefit of employees as well as business revenue
is something that has gone wrong for a number of businesses this year,"
he tells IT Pro.

"Numerous startups and SMBs have risen to the challenge, committing to a
hybrid working model in an effort to move with the times. If only it
were that simple. Too many SMBs have learnt the hard way that more than
just commitment is needed to make hybrid working a success."

How to avoid becoming the next casualty

Startups and SMBs need to act now to ensure they're not the next victim,
says Henrik Grim, MD of Europe for Capchase. He tells IT Pro there's a
rapidly growing alternative financing scene that could help companies
avoid reducing its headcount, which is, in many cases,
counterproductive. 

"If you require capital to weather an economic storm, there are options
available," he says. The startup scene is not entirely reliant on VC
capital to fuel growth. In 2008 the collapse in funding meant that new
startups were hobbled, failures were exacerbated, and growth severely
curtailed. Now, however, there are scores of companies offering numerous
ways for viable startups to continue to get capital. Traditional finance
is also very different, with loans from banks a genuine option for many
startups.

-   SEE MORE What does it take to launch a successful Fintech startup?

Grim adds the tech downturn is likely to be very uneven, affecting some
types of startups more than others: "Tech-enabled businesses - which
have lower margins and capital efficiency - such as logistics, proptech
and physical goods retailers are going to find it a very tough time.
However, pure tech businesses - such as software as a service (SaaS),
cyber security and many fintech startups - are going to be much less
exposed".

For those startups looking to continue on the route of more traditional
funding methods, Almasque notes they need to move beyond buzzwords:
"They need to demonstrate that they're solving real problems; addressing
IT infrastructure efficiency, tackling data analysis problems or in some
other way improving people's lives in a tangible way."

Leach adds that while it's clear there's no reason for all small
businesses to panic just yet, it's vital to build a contingency plan to
allow them to allocate company budgets more effectively. "The four main
areas business should be monitoring and focusing on are company debt,
decision making, digital transformation, and workforce management," he
tells IT Pro. "Avoiding the mass layoffs that we have seen recently is
due to poor planning and change management."

According to Dutta Satadip, chief customer officer at ActiveCampaign,
startups can also weather the current economic storm if they focus on
providing a superior customer experience to their competitors. "Many
SMBs and entrepreneurs have a lot to win against larger brands,
especially in the face of 'shop small' movements," he says. "People
understand the impact that supporting an SMB can have and sometimes will
even make a point of trying to shop outside of the tech giants, which is
why providing 1:1 experiences help with customer retention. 

2.  SEE MORE UK tech startups to watch in 2022

"However, to win these customers and have them return back as repeat
customers, developing radical transparency is a must. Radical
transparency begins with keeping customers informed, from informing them
about delays on circumstances out of your control to proactively
updating them rather than the customers chasing the company for
updates."

It's not just customers that need to be kept happy, as Hanson - who
warns that a failure to implement hybrid working could also be having a
detrimental impact on UK startups - says a proactive approach to
flexibility is also key. "The at-home set-up for each employee must be
considered and supported carefully," Satadip continues. "Without an
office of colleagues to ask immediately for help or ad hoc tech support,
it's even more essential the tools and platforms your business operates
on work seamlessly together to remove potential points of friction for
your staff."

How this entrepreneur failed twice and found success by making
semi-automatic bike covers

ntrepreneur Keshav Rai founded Bike Blazer in 2016 to help bike owners
keep their bikes dust-free. In a span of five years, the startup has
sold around 75,000 semi-automatic bike covers and is seeing an annual
turnover of Rs 1.3 crore.

Twenty-seven-year-old Keshav Rai was an average student in school and
was not very academically inclined. His keen interest to repair things
around him led him to pursue engineering.

While in college, Keshav says he would discuss startup ideas with his
friends. "We used to sit for long hours and discuss ideas. But nothing
worked out," Keshav adds.

Keshav was so serious about starting his own company that he requested
his father to fund one of his app-based businesses in 2015. But as they
say, timing is everything. If it's meant to happen, it will. Keshav's
first startup was a failure. But his will to innovate and learn gave him
entrepreneurial success later.

Keshav started Bike Blazer in late 2016. It offers two-wheeler parking
covers that are water resistant and protects vehicles from dust. The
handy device can be fixed on the vehicle and the overall operational
time of the cover is below 30 seconds, says Keshav.

Today, Bike Blazer is seeing an annual turnover of Rs 1.3 crore.

The inspiration behind Bike Blazer

After failing in his first business, it was becoming tough for Keshav to
sit at home doing nothing. One day, he decided to pack his bags and left
home telling his parents that he would return in four days.

He walked on the streets for three days without being able to come up
with any idea to secure his future. However, on the fourth day, while
Keshav was on his way back home, he was sitting in the parking lot of
Kaushambi metro station in Delhi and saw a man searching for a dusting
fabric to wipe his bike. As he couldn't find anything, he took the
duster from a bike next to him, wiped his bike, and went away.

Looking at this, Keshav got an idea. He immediately went to his father
and pitched his business idea.

"I told my father that we could manufacture bike covers that would be
semi-automatic and would avoid the hassle of people carrying it around
every day. My father liked the idea and readily supported me," he adds.

The market was untapped, Keshav says, adding that he felt this idea
would do wonders to the company as the kind of product he was planning
was not available in the market. This laid the foundation to Bike Blazer
in late 2016, and Keshav even filed a patent in 2017.

To begin with, Keshav started manufacturing these covers on the terrace
of his house. Now, the company has two manufacturing units in New Delhi
and Ghaziabad.

Bike covers for bike lovers

Describing the product, Keshav says, "The bike cover is made from
industrial-grade Nylon Taffeta (parachute fabric), which is weather
resistant. It has an ingenious mechanism, which enables it to drain
water collected after a rainfall to keep the interiors dry. Even a wet
cover can be rolled inside the device."

To use the portable, semi-automatic bike cover, one has to pull out the
cover from the device and cover the entire bike and rotate the handle to
fold it back in. According to Keshav, it takes less than 30 seconds to
do this. Bike Blazer also has an in-built anti-theft and anti-vibration
lock and a safety red reflector tape for additional safety.

On the company's website, the product is priced between Rs 780 and Rs
850, and it is available on ecommerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart
for Rs 899. Keshav says, the price of the cover varies depending on the
size.

The market and challenges

According to the founder, in the initial days, it was a challenge for
the company to explain the product to people.

"It is difficult to change people's habits. Wiping bikes using an old
cloth is a habit in India, and making people spend extra money for that
was quite challenging," Keshav tells SMBStory.

Given the current business scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
keeping pace with the export business has also been challenging.

Besides, Keshav adds that finding the right talent that trusts the
company has also been a daunting task.

Bike Blazer

The company, which was started with an investment of around Rs 2 lakh,
made a turnover of around Rs 7 lakh in the first year. By the second
year, after promoting the product on social media platforms and having
been listed on an online marketplace, the company's turnover jumped to
Rs 55 lakh, and Keshav hasn't looked back since then.

In a span of five years, the company is now making an annual turnover of
Rs 1.3 crore, Keshav claims.

The way forward

In the future, Keshav says he is planning to launch similar products for
four wheelers.

"Execution is the real devil. Ideas can be generated in a few hours of
brainstorming, but it takes years and sometimes a lifetime to build a
business around it," he adds.

Bengaluru:“We are facing a very difficult situation with the changes in
MCA21,” a Kolkata-based company secretary said, even as the deadline to
complete filing of several corporate forms nears. Chartered accountants
(CAs) and company secretaries (CS) TOIspoke with said that that these
glitches have been going on for one year, which was when the transition
to the new version of the corporate affairs ministry's website began.
All forms other than annual returns have been affected.

These include forms like DPT3, where the company is supposed to declare
loan and outstanding balance. This was introduced a few years ago. Some
other forms are related to allocation of share capital and details of
any loans taken from banks. Jigar Shah, partner in JMJA & Associates
LLP, said more people are feeling the pain now because the changes are
applicable for all companies. The corporate affairs ministry had begun
the tran- sition with limited liability partnership firms (LLPs) when it
began last year. “The major problem is that we are not able to submit
forms. We are getting suggestions like 'go incognito' and 'change
password' if we want to file our documents. To add to the trouble, when
there are failures, startups and companies are asked to pay additional
fees, and use of our funds are restricted till forms are filed,” Shah
told TOI. Many professionals have been giving each other advice like
clearing the cache, signing out and signing in again, if they are not
able to fill the form. These glitches have resulted in a Twitter trend
with the hashtag #V3errors. Company secretaries are using the
microblogging site to highlight their concerns. One CA tweeted that he
had raised his complaint on March 16 and even on March.24, his issues
were not looked into. IT firm LTIMindtree has been managing the website
through the transition. This is not the first time a government portal
is making the news for glitches. LTIMindtree, in a statement, said that
users must adapt fully to the changes on the portal for seamless filing.
It also went on to say that the portal is working fine. “Even the
process of digital signatures of the forms has undergone a change and
now only users who are registered on the system post KYC, are allowed to
sign forms, to ensure traceability. Additionally, V3 of the portal has
been built using online web forms (as compared to offline PDF forms in
V2), which enables users in online checking of data entered, pre-filling
of master data, validations through external data sources like CBDT and
continued linked form filing,” the company said.

Lean startup for opportunity exploitation: adoption constraints and
strategies in technology new ventures

ABSTRACT

Purpose

Most studies investigating the adoption of lean startup (LS) practices
by technology new ventures focus on software startups in mature
entrepreneurial ecosystems and disregard their applicability for
opportunity exploitation in other technological backgrounds. This study
contributes to this research stream by exploring how Brazilian
technology new ventures (in different technological fields) tentatively
adopt LS to exploit opportunities and whether LS is suitable to their
emerging economy context.

Design/methodology/approach

The authors adopt an exploratory multiple-case study based on
qualitative data collection and analysis of nine Brazilian
biotechnology, engineering and software startups.

Findings

The study shows how technology new ventures tackle the activities of
opportunity exploitation → namely, developing a product or service,
acquiring human resources, gathering financial resources and setting up
the organization → by leveraging LS tools and practices for business
model validation; also, it identifies six contextual constraints
hindering the systematic adoption of LS and reveals how technology new
ventures cope with such constraints in their early stages by integrating
LS with complementary strategies and practices. Furthermore, the study
reveals that the systematic and comprehensive adoption of LS nurtures
the development of an entrepreneurial experimental capability to explore
opportunities in a quasi-scientific and hypothesis-driven fashion.

Originality/value

The study investigates how Brazilian engineering, biotechnology and
software startups exploit opportunities and overcome constraints to
business model validation through the combined adoption of LS and
complementary strategies and practices and provides a set of
propositions to guide future research.

Introduction

We are currently experiencing the emergence and prominence of what has
been dubbed startups, i.e. technology new ventures operating with low
resources and under extreme risks, aiming at finding a business model
that is both repeatable and scalable (Blank, 2013; Clarysse and Bruneel,
2007). Entrepreneurs running startups generally identify (or are exposed
to) opportunities and then engage in an opportunity-exploitation process
(Alvarez and Barney, 2007) attempting to reach sustained and profitable
stages in their business development (c.f. Picken, 2017).

To support these technology new ventures in their nontraditional
settings, the lean startup (LS) proposes a set of practices to test and
validate ideas and products through experimentation, thus responding
more rapidly to market shifts. LS is increasingly getting the attention
of practitioners and large organizations (Ganguly and Euchner, 2018;
Power, 2014; Ries, 2017), as well as scholars striving to understand its
origins, the entrepreneurial cognitions behind the approach and its
impacts on entrepreneurs and business performance (Bortolini et al.,
2018; Mansoori, 2017; Shepherd and Gruber, 2020).

LS is centered on experimentation and hypothesis-driven practices, and
its main principle lies in rapidly learning from failure (Ries, 2011,
2017), a line of inquiry long addressed by esteemed journals (Cope,
2011; Espinoza-Benavides and Díaz, 2019; Knott and Posen, 2005) and most
recently again called upon (see Amankwah-Amoah and Wang, 2019; Omorede,
2020). Despite the increasing relevance of LS as a timely topic for
technology entrepreneurship and business model innovation, extant
research has largely explored its adoption among digital ventures and
scholars disregard the investigation of LS adoption and applicability in
startups with technology backgrounds other than software (Silva et al.,
2019). This is particularly problematic considering the richness within
the nexus of entrepreneurship and technology (c.f. Beckman et al.,
2012a).

Furthermore, the majority of studies investigating LS and technology new
ventures are greatly concentrated in developed economies (Silva et al.,
2019). The context might constraint the development of technology new
ventures (Amankwah-Amoah and Hinson, 2019), and scholars have long
underscored the importance of investigating business performance in both
developed and developing economies (Chacar and Vissa, 2005; Hoskisson et
al., 2000). More specifically in the Latin American context, Brazil
stands out regarding its innovative behavior, leading the region in
several manufacturing and innovation indicators (Frank et al., 2016;
Olavarrieta and Villena, 2014). Despite its relevance, the Brazilian
startup ecosystem is still largely understudied.

Drawing on the above discussions, the research questions this study sets
forth are: how do LS (and LS-related) practices support opportunity
exploitation in technology new ventures? And how does the Brazilian
context affect the impact of LS practices on opportunity exploitation?
This study contributes to both theory and practice by exploring how LS
practices assist Brazilian entrepreneurs (from three different
technology fields) in exploiting opportunities. Based on an exploratory
multiple-case study, the contributions of the present study are
threefold: (1) we conclude that LS supports entrepreneurs in the process
of opportunity exploitation and development of entrepreneurial
experimental capabilities; (2) we identify contextual constraints that
may impose limitations to the extent to which LS is applicable in
different technology fields and (3) we provide a set of propositions
concerning LS adoption and the development of entrepreneurial
experimental capabilities for opportunity exploitation.

The following section presents the theoretical streams in which the
study is positioned. Next, the paper presents the research setting as
well as data collection and analysis. The empirical analysis and results
follow the research method section. Finally, the authors present the
discussion of the findings, the conclusions with the study's
contributions and limitations and avenues for future research.

Theoretical background

Opportunity exploitation and technology entrepreneurship

There is a vast literature addressing different sorts of sources from
which entrepreneurs discover or create opportunities and engage in
entrepreneurial action (Alvarez and Barney, 2007). The economist Israel
Kirzner, of the Austrian School of economic thought, is one of the
precursors of the discovery theory of entrepreneurship, and he advocates
the arbitrage-based approach to entrepreneurship, in which entrepreneurs
do not necessarily search for opportunities; instead, they must nurture
alertness for such opportunities to be discovered spontaneously
(Kirzner, 1973, 1997). By contrast, whereas arbitrage concerns
negotiating in existing markets, innovating and introducing new products
involves market creation, including a new source of uncertainty for the
entrepreneur (Wadeson, 2013). Hence, modern literature on
entrepreneurship has also considered the previously disregarded
processes of learning and adaptation, providing an alternative
theoretical framework to the discovery lens, termed the creation theory
of entrepreneurship (Alvarez and Barney, 2007; Gartner, 1985; Wadeson,
2013). According to the creational perspective, opportunities are not
formed by exogenous shocks to an industry or market, nor are they
necessarily derived from pre-existing industries; rather, opportunities
are social constructs endogenously created by actions of entrepreneurs
(Alvarez and Barney, 2007; Sarasvathy, 2001; Wadeson, 2013). More
recently, extant literature has underscored the importance of regional
competitiveness and university proximity to entrepreneurial activity by
addressing the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (Acs et
al., 2013; Agarwal et al., 2007). Firms and entrepreneurs can benefit
from knowledge spillovers as a source of entrepreneurial opportunities.

Regardless of the source of the entrepreneurial opportunity,
entrepreneurship comprises the “identification and exploitation of
previously unexploited opportunities” (Hitt et al., 2001, p. 480). Thus,
opportunity recognition and exploitation are distinct aspects in the
entrepreneurial process (Jarvis, 2016). As such, the essence of
opportunity exploitation lies in refining competencies, technologies and
paradigms and is heavily grounded in the acquisition of knowledge
(Corbett, 2005; March, 1991; Sirén et al., 2012). Recently, Kuckertz et
al. (2017) discussed several issues within entrepreneurship literature
stemming from unclear definitions concerning opportunity recognition and
exploitation, and they put forth more explicit content domains regarding
both concepts. Following their work, the present study acknowledges
opportunity exploitation as “characterized by developing a product or
service based on a perceived entrepreneurial opportunity, acquiring
appropriate human resources, gathering financial resources, and setting
up the organization” (Kuckertz et al., 2017, p. 92).

Despite existing studies emphasizing the importance of integrating
entrepreneurial and strategic thinking, underscoring how capabilities
are critical for exploiting business opportunities (Agarwal et al.,
2010; Hitt et al., 2001; Liao and Phan, 2016), these and other issues
are surprisingly underexplored in the context of technology
entrepreneurship (Lamine et al., 2018). In this regard, technology
entrepreneurship draws on the fields of entrepreneurship and
technology-based innovation (Beckman et al., 2012a), and it is critical
to economic progress and regional transformation (Schumpeter, 1943;
Venkataraman, 2004). Despite its positive impacts on national and
regional levels, technology entrepreneurship comprises peculiarities and
imposes several challenges, such as (but not limited to) design,
implementation and measurement of supportive public policies (Brown and
Mason, 2014; Dalmarco et al., 2018), acquisition of competencies and
strategic articulation (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; Zahra, 1996),
coordination of teams in high-technology environments (Puranam et al.,
2006) and major concerns regarding the delivery of timely payoffs to
investors (Islam et al., 2018; Walsh et al., 2002).

The mechanisms by which entrepreneurs shape technology new ventures are
often contingent on several factors, such as institutional
characteristics of the national economy or its industry sector (Beckman
et al., 2012b). Research on technology entrepreneurship has grown over
the past few years, but many issues regarding opportunity exploitation
remain overlooked. For instance, the very recent work of Yusubova et al.
(2020) increased our understanding of technology new ventures in aspects
related to team formation and evolution according to changes in
technological knowledge needs; by contrast, scholars still call for
inquiries disclosing approaches used to generate revenues or
environmental contingencies influencing strategies adopted by these
technology startups during the process of opportunity exploitation
(Bailetti, 2012; Mosey et al., 2017). Hence, this study argues that a
pragmatic approach that experienced a significant adoption in mature
entrepreneurial ecosystems (i.e. lean startup) should be considered a
relevant methodology to assist startups in exploiting opportunities and
developing entrepreneurial experimental capabilities.

Lean startup

The LS methodology is a set of processes and approaches derived from the
application of lean principles (see Lean Enterprise Institute, 2019;
Womack and Jones, 1997) to entrepreneurship, targeted at improving the
way companies are developed and new products are launched through
disciplined entrepreneurship. Eric Ries (2011) proposed LS aiming at
eliminating waste often found in product and business development
processes in startups and assisting entrepreneurs at validating
assumptions and cease activities with no value creation (Bortolini et
al., 2018; Frederiksen and Brem, 2017).

As Ries (2011) states, a startup is a catalyst that transforms ideas
into products. To assist entrepreneurs, LS proposes a three-step process
called build—measure→learn (BML) loop. The build phase is started
quickly with the deployment of a minimum viable product (MVP), a version
of the product with minimum amount of effort, although comprising a set
of viable functionalities, that will allow the entrepreneur to measure
its impact on the market, test fundamental hypotheses and get customer
feedback in early stages. During the measure phase, the challenge lies
in determining whether the product development efforts are being
effective by tracking actual customer behavior when interacting with the
MVP based on a set of preordained relevant metrics. Finally, the BML
loop completes with a reflection by the entrepreneur, who learns from
the experimentation performed and has to decide whether to change the
original business model based on customer feedback, persevere or drop it
all together (Ries, 2011). This change in one or more elements of the
business model is also known as pivot, and the organization can pivot
shifting small features of the product or conducting significant changes
in the whole project.

Although the BML loop may seem simple, LS is fundamentally based on a
scientific method for developing hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship and
innovation (Eisenmann et al., 2011). Thus, it requires crucial attention
during the definition of the assumptions to be tested. In the BML loop,
each business model element is tested employing falsifiable hypotheses,
i.e. hypotheses generated starting from the original business idea that
can be rejected based on experiments. A motto commonly associated to LS
is fail fast, which assumes that failure fosters learning, and in the
early stages of a startup it is preferable to realize as soon as
possible that the business should be dropped, rather than stubbornly
persevering with a wrong idea that burns scarce resources (Eisenmann et
al., 2011).

One of the core components of LS lies in using performance indicators
and metrics to measure the continuous development process (Maurya,
2012). In this operation, startups can benefit from early ongoing
interactions with customers, increasing their chances to succeed without
vast amounts of outside funding to launch their products (Trimi and
Berbegal-Mirabent, 2012).

During the entrepreneurial activity, business model design and
innovation are critical operationalization tools in the strategy-making
processes (Cortimiglia et al., 2016). In this regard, entrepreneurial
capabilities refer to abilities to sense, shape and exploit
opportunities through specific heuristics for competitive advantage
(Abdelgawad et al., 2013; Zahra et al., 2011). Following this reasoning,
we call entrepreneurial experimental capabilities the technology new
ventures' ability to exploit opportunities in a quasi-scientific,
hypothesis-driven, structured and rigorous fashion → as opposed to an
overly complicated and often unsuitable planning approach (e.g. Ghezzi,
2019; Sarasvathy, 2001) or an unstructured, experiential trial and error
process (e.g. Sosna et al., 2010).

Recent literature has built connections between entrepreneurship theory
and practice, advancing the understanding concerning the role of LS
within discovery/creation theories of entrepreneurship and investigating
entrepreneurial cognitions behind its learning processes (Bortolini et
al., 2018; Contigiani and Levinthal, 2019; Ghezzi, 2019, 2020). Although
LS has had a relevant impact on entrepreneurial research, most studies
addressing LS are limited to investigating its application within
digital startups located in developed regions (Silva et al., 2019). This
narrowed focus brings relevant implications.

First, in technology entrepreneurship, developments in science or
engineering constitute core elements of the opportunity enabling the
rise of a new venture or market (Beckman et al., 2012a). Thus, studies
investigating LS applicability should explore startups pertaining to
fields beyond the digital domain.

Second, emerging economies generally comprise rapid-pace development
countries with governmental policies favoring economic liberalization
(Wright et al., 2005). Scholars have underscored the importance of such
contexts, also investigating business performance in both developed and
developing economies (Chacar and Vissa, 2005; Hoskisson et al., 2000;
Vissa and Chacar, 2009). These emerging economies are experiencing
significant institutional transformations, with both opportunities and
challenges for entrepreneurial firms (Boso et al., 2013). Additionally,
emerging economies account for a large proportion of populations in the
“base-of-the-pyramid” with obstacles related to literacy, numeracy and
cognition, which entail limited new product adoption and market
consumption (Nakata and Weidner, 2012). Consequently, this scenario also
presents relevant opportunities for entrepreneurship research, which is
still limited, since these locations remain outside the typical focus of
entrepreneurship scholars (Bruton et al., 2008; Xu and Meyer, 2013;
Yamakawa et al., 2013).

Although all startups are intrinsically immersed in volatility, the
risks are higher for ventures located in less developed regions since
“the environmental uncertainty is a major characteristic of emerging
economies” (Yu et al., 2018, p. 2). Furthermore, the context of emerging
economies also challenges some assumptions of theories originally
developed for mature economies (Xu and Meyer, 2013). By investigating
technology new ventures in the Brazilian context, we shed light on LS
applicability beyond software startups as well as its adoption in
different contexts and settings.

Research methods

Research setting and cases' selection: entrepreneurship in Brazil

The substantial growth potential of emergent economies in the global
market has been strongly represented by the evolution of those countries
summarized in the BRIC acronym, initially coined in a report by Goldman
Sachs in 2003 and recently expanded to BRIICS, comprising Brazil,
Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (Sengupta et al.,
2018). More specifically in the Brazilian context, the creation,
development and consolidation of science parks are increasing in the
last years. In a report developed by the Technological Development
Center of the University of Brasília and the Brazilian Ministry of
Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication, between years 2000
and 2013, the country has gone from 10 to 94 science and technology
parks (STPs) initiatives (CDT/UnB, 2014). Those STPs are important
articulators for local and regional innovation systems, as well as
inductors of qualification in degraded areas of large Brazilian urban
centers (Zouain and Plonski, 2015).

In a national context, the Rio Grande do Sul state, in Southern Brazil,
stands out for ranking fourth in the national GDP, housing 25
universities and federal institutes with about 53.3 thousand researchers
(CDT/UnB, 2014). In terms of technology-based ventures, the state is
home to a number of 150 digital startups, mostly located in the
metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, the state's capital (SEBRAE, 2016).

Porto Alegre is ranked seventh in a recent report revealing the best 32
Brazilian cities for entrepreneurs (Endeavor, 2015) and its metropolitan
region houses three relevant STPs: Zenit, Tecnopuc and Tecnosinos. The
STPs arise from federal and private educational institutes with
importance in both regional and national settings. Zenit, Tecnopuc and
Tecnosinos foster research and technology-based innovation bolstering
startups on fields such as information and communication technology,
engineering, biotechnology, energy and creative industry. Additionally,
the STPs are home to global-leading-companies like SAP, HP and Huawei.

One can observe recent gradual efforts concerning the development of
innovation and entrepreneurship studies in Brazil acknowledging its
relevance as an emerging player (e.g. Fernandes et al., 2019; Frank et
al., 2016; de Gomes et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the difficulties faced
by Brazilian entrepreneurs driving technology new ventures lie outside
the scope of the extant literature, representing an important gap that
needs to be backed by empirical investigation.

This study aims at extending theory using a multiple-case study
(Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). In this regard, qualitative research is
particularly suitable and favorable in the early stages of theorizing as
it provides open-ended data and allows detailed analyses of complex
processes (Graebner et al., 2012; Langley, 1999). Unlike other research
strategies, case studies are not intended for predictions about
statistical relationships and frequencies but to gain new and useful
insights on a contemporary phenomenon (Yin, 2014).

For the present study, the authors selected nine technology new ventures
within Zenit, Tecnopuc and Tecnosinos STPs in Porto Alegre metropolitan
region. The cases were selected through theoretical sampling, due to
their particular suitability to illuminate and extend relationships and
logics among constructs (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007; Sigglekow,
2007). Although empirical qualitative research has limitations in
providing generalization reasoning, the authors collected data from
ventures on similar fields, but in different environments, which enables
a possible cross-case analysis as well as ensures external validity and
replication logic, central to building theory from case studies
(Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2014). In this regard, Patton (2014) identifies
40 purposeful sampling strategies organized within eight categories. In
this paper, we adopted the sensitizing concept strategy (Patton, 2014)
within the theoretical sampling (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007)
category. Thus, the authors selected informant-rich cases that
illuminate sensitizing concepts in the particular context (Patton, 2014)
of the inquiry.

The authors investigated startups on three main technology fields:
software, engineering and biotechnology. Those fields were designated
based on the range of projects covered by the STPs; also, in a recent
annual report developed by the Innovation Research Interchange on R&D
trends forecast, innovation leaders mentioned systems from these three
fields as most important technologies in the following years, with
special attention to big data, artificial intelligence and machine
learning, 3D printing, automation and robotics, nanotechnology and
bioengineering, among others (Innovation Research Interchange, 2018).
Furthermore, all startups selected were still struggling to pursue the
ideal business model and were still being incubated in a somewhat
“stalemating” condition, which afforded useful appraisal considering the
objective of investigating the opportunity exploitation process in
technology new ventures. To mitigate bias, the authors conducted
stratified sampling drawing on the design of experiments (Doe). The
study adopted a crossed factorial design (Montgomery, 2017), collecting
data from the same number of startups in all combinations of the levels
of the stratification variables: environment (Zenit, Tecnopuc, and
Tecnosinos) and technology field (software, engineering and
biotechnology). For each field, one startup was contacted and
interviewed in each science park, resulting in three startups per STP.

The ventures' existence ranged from three to 11 years. The study did not
select the startups based on time of existence since the main
definitions of startups do not consider age but rather their volatile
and risky environment as well as their search for business model
scalability and replicability (Blank, 2013; Cooper and Park, 2008).
However, the authors selected startups that have supplanted the ideation
phase, developing prototypes or with products/services already in the
market.

Data collection and analysis

This study adopts an exploratory multiple-case study approach on
qualitative data collection and analysis (Yin, 2014). The authors opted
for qualitative research as it is useful for theory building (Eisenhardt
and Graebner, 2007), and is best suited for understanding the
informants' perspective of the world, addressing how, rather than how
many questions (Pratt, 2009). Additionally, the multiple-case approach
increases external validity, mitigates observer bias and provides a
stronger base for theory (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007; Voss et al.,
2002; Yin, 2014).

The authors relied on three sources of data: direct observation,
interviews and archival material. First, the first author attended to
meetings related to the design and analysis of market strategies in each
of the investigated startups. The first author took field notes
concerning how decisions were made about adjustments in the
products/services, market segmentation or financial resources.

Next, the authors conducted individual interviews using a
semi-structured questionnaire. The objective was threefold: (1) to know
the background of the respondents and their ventures, (2) to explore how
the entrepreneurs understand the practices used for the validation of
business model elements and (3) to investigate strategies put forth by
the entrepreneurs to gather financial resources for their ventures.
Although theory-building research should start as close as possible to
no theory under consideration and no hypotheses to test, it is
admittedly “impossible to achieve this ideal of a clean theoretical
slate” (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 536). Nevertheless, the authors attempted
to sustain a neutral perspective. Hence, the participants were not
exposed to any preordained relationship regarding theory or approach,
such as LS adoption, opportunity exploitation and the development of
entrepreneurial experimental capabilities, before or during the
investigation.

Prior to collecting primary data, the researchers conducted two pilot
interviews with founders from digital and engineering-based startups
(not included in the sample). This strategy allowed the study to improve
the clearness of the research questions and confirm the potential to
draw insightful discussions. The authors interviewed at least two
founders per startup. In the context of entrepreneurial firms,
organizational and individual learning are roughly equivalent given the
firm's relatively small number of people and limited structure (Bingham
and Eisenhardt, 2011; Kim, 1993; Zahra et al., 2000); thus, the number
of founders suffices the disclosure of logics and mechanisms within
early-stage technology new ventures.

The interviews, which lasted between 30 and 75 min, were recorded, fully
transcribed and analyzed. If any information was still unclear and/or
more data were needed, the informants were later contacted for
clarification. The entrepreneurs were also asked to provide
complementary materials which they felt were relevant to their startups'
development. Thus, secondary data were gathered in the form of business
plans, canvases and press news, which resulted in thick descriptions of
each technology new venture. Hence, all data were iteratively compared.
When the authors spotted changes in business model elements during the
analysis of archival material, the entrepreneurs were again interviewed
to provide additional reflections on past experiences. Table 1 depicts
the cases and the data sources used.

For the content analysis, the study borrowed coding practices from the
grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 2008), a
methodology for understanding how actors interpret reality, allowing
systematic work out of hypotheses and concepts in relation to data
during the investigation (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Suddaby, 2006). The
authors executed a coding procedure based on in vivo and constructed
codes (Strauss and Corbin, 2008) drawing on the nine cases. The authors
conducted a first-order analysis (Van Maanen, 1974; Pratt, 2009),
thoroughly coding information from the three sources of data. Such data
triangulation increased construct validity by developing converging
lines of inquiry with the multiple sources of information (Yin, 2014),
imperative to a reliable and persuasive qualitative research with
stronger substantiation of constructs (Eisenhardt, 1989; Sigglekow,
2007). The authors used the constant comparative method, iteratively
contrasting and comparing to discern major concepts of interest (Clark
et al., 2010).

The authors grouped second-order themes that subsumed the first-order
concepts, allowing the study to explain the patterning and view the data
at a higher level of abstraction (Clark et al., 2010; Glaser and
Strauss, 1967; Van Maanen, 1974). In the third and concluding stage of
the analysis, the authors grouped the second-order themes into three
overarching dimensions: opportunity exploitation, entrepreneurial
experimental capabilities and LS adoption. The systematic coding
procedure enabled data interpretation and categorization, which is key
for detecting patterns and proceeding with theory building (Saldaña,
2013).

After the individual analysis of each case and identification of
isolated elements, the authors executed a cross-case analysis to
identify similarities, differences and patterns among cases. The study
retained the relationships replicated across most (or all) of the cases
under analysis to provide a more robust and generalizable resulting
theory (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). Finally, the authors cycled
among data (contrasting the results of the cross-case analysis) and
relevant literature to develop a final integrated theoretical framework;
the present study employed the cases as illustration to make a valuable
conceptual contribution (Sigglekow, 2007). Ventures' and respondents'
names were changed to preserve anonymity [1].

Figure 1 shows the data structure for the findings in line with the
methods previously presented. It illustrates the first-order concepts,
second-order themes and the overarching dimensions that emerged from the
analyses, including the opportunity exploitation, entrepreneurial
experimental capabilities and the LS adoption. Figure 1 depicts the core
concepts and their relationships, with no intention of indicating
causality or to be a representative dynamic model in itself.

The modus operandi of Brazilian technology new ventures

The authors identified different strategies adopted by the startups to
exploit opportunities drawing on the different data sources provided.
Table 2 summarizes the main practices each technology new venture made
use of in their early stages.

The findings are organized into four subsections comprising the three
technology fields in which the investigated startups are based and one
subsection disclosing commonalities in their opportunity exploitation.
In each subsection, the authors present the context of the technology
new ventures and briefly detail the strategies adopted by the
entrepreneurs to exploit opportunities, also whether they made use of LS
practices during their business development.

Biotechnology startups

During the investigation, the authors identified particularities
constraining the biotechnology startups from adopting experimentation
and gathering financial resources: “it is much harder to attract
investments when you do not have the resources to produce an MVP or high
numbers of customer traction, as in software businesses” (B3). The
biotechnology startups investigated commercialized products with long
development cycles and, although B2 was able to occasionally execute
usability tests, none of the ventures fully adopted LS practices;
nevertheless, the entrepreneurs pursued alternative strategies to raise
investments, such as participating and gaining prizes in international
fairs, which afforded some sort of recognition from the market and gave
confidence to investors.

Other major issues faced by biotechnology startups relate to legal and
technological uncertainties. The former refers to the lack of a solid
legislation, and it was particularly latent when investigating the case
of B1, which works with biodiversity molecules; according to the
entrepreneurs, “the government still relies on existing provisional
measures” (B1). Such a legal uncertainty directly entails fear on
investors and subsequent difficulties in building and testing MVPs. To
countervail this uncertainty, the startup resorted to exploiting
alternative opportunities. Thus, while their product was under
development, B1 made use of their biotechnology database to
commercialize their knowledge to other organizations.

Finally, technological uncertainties also entailed concerns during the
opportunity exploitation as they make the product development process
more challenging. The statement retrieved from one of the interviews
with B3 offers a compelling argument on this matter: “if you put 5
people in a room and 500 people in a gymnasium, you cannot foresee that
the latter group is going to have the same behavior as the former one;
there is no proportional rule, the behavior is not linear, and neither
is our production.” Thus, this hurdle calls for extra risks regarding
production and business model scalability.

Engineering startups

Similar to the biotechnology startups, the engineering startups also
face challenges regarding long development cycles in their product
development process; nevertheless, the investigation of the cases
revealed additional concerns related to this matter and, consequently,
to the stage of opportunity exploitation. In the case of the
engineering-based ventures, the entrepreneurs struggle with delays
between identifying the customers' needs and designing and manufacturing
products to meet those needs. Furthermore, E3 revealed that incremental
updates are not well-received by their clients because they
commercialize expensive machinery assets: “digital applications are
allowed to have quick updates, but machines are not. If I try to sell a
second updated version of a machine in a short period, my client will
ask me why I previously delivered a version without the improvements”.

The market segmentation in which the entrepreneurial opportunity is
pursued also brings further implications on the strategies adopted to
exploit it. E1 and E3 have the heavy industry as a major client and the
entrepreneurs had difficulties in conducting experiments with initial
versions of the products. “I cannot conduct experiments in production
lines without a minimum level of reliability so that my product will not
compromise my clients' performance. If I fail in the middle of the
client's production line, I'm doomed” (E3). This requirement for a
greater level of reliability was made explicit by E3 but also shared by
the other engineering startups, which entailed in resistance from
clients to conduct experiments and led the entrepreneurs to adopt a
process for product development that resembles the stage-gate approach,
with in-between steps of technical assessments.

During the investigation, the authors observed a regulatory requirement
obstructing the process of opportunity exploitation. Although some
biotechnology startups shared this obstacle, it was more explicit in the
cases of the engineering startups. These technology new ventures must
make sure their tests and products are approved by not only the market
but also by ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) and INMETRO
(National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology), Brazilian
agencies responsible for the observance of metrology and compliance
policies, as well as sanitary control of products and services subject
to health regulation and related environments. These obligatory
approvals slow down the process of product development and the
validation of business model elements: “to install a photovoltaic system
in a residence, I have to formally request the electric utility to allow
the installation, and I must obtain a technical responsibility note of
the project signed by an engineer” (E2). Thus, bureaucracy and the need
to comply with excessive regulation may also reduce the velocity of
experimentation in technology new ventures.

Finally, the entrepreneurs revealed a different strategy adopted in the
early stages of E1: the entrepreneurs structured a traditional business
plan and applied in several calls for grants. E1 was selected to receive
subvention investments, which supported the development of a new
technology and, according to the entrepreneurs, served as a validation
of their product.

Software startups

Contrary to the biotechnology and engineering startups, the investigated
software startups did not face idiosyncratic constraints hindering the
adoption of experimentation during their opportunity exploitation
processes. Nevertheless, these particular technology new ventures
demonstrated scattered adoption of LS or any other
experimentation-driven practice (Table 2). More specifically, the
entrepreneurs often adopted A/B testing and usability assessments when
designing adjustments in their products or to evaluate their market
segmentation; however, none of these practices were adopted
systematically or in a structured manner.

One of the reasons for the scattered adoption of the tools was explained
by one of the entrepreneurs: “the software industry provides way too
many agile tools, so we use a few (interchangeably) when we believe it
is needed” (S2). By contrast, the entrepreneurs leading S1 did
acknowledge the value of testing with customers beforehand and adopting
agile practices; according to the entrepreneurs, the rationale
underneath such practices and tools support the team in mitigating bias
from initial assumptions; nevertheless, the startup does not implement
the tools systematically.

In the investigation, S3 stood out by adopting a more comprehensive
mentality toward hypothesis-driven experimentation, which was evident
during validations of their business model elements. Nonetheless,
according to the entrepreneurs, during the initial stages of their
startup, the initial features of their product were built based on what
the team believed was the best, and they barely performed experiments;
then, during their incubation process, they became aware of LS
practices: “we used to release features and observe what happened. Many
things happened, and we could not trace the reasons […] we built lots of
things and we did not know what to measure, which feature was being
effective and which was responsible for increases in the retention of
users” (S3). During planning meetings, the entrepreneurs still struggled
to establish accurate metrics; even so, all the team emphasized their
evolution and the importance of adhering to such an approach.

Heuristics in technology new ventures

Despite the startup S3 making use of hypotheses and experiments to
develop their products, the entrepreneurs did not adopt the tools
comprehensively (as depicted in Ries, 2011; Silva et al., 2019). Six out
of the nine startups revealed making use of casual situations to obtain
feedback from customers (Table 2); that is, the entrepreneurs took
advantage of personal networks and obtained feedback informally in
occasional private gatherings. Finally, throughout the analysis of
documents, the authors observed several pivots throughout the existence
the startups; during the interviews, most of the respondents described
executing these pivots intuitively, i.e. without explicit metrics to
strongly support decisions.

Discussion

Lean startup within different technology fields

Startups are generally conceived from an idea or problem observed by the
entrepreneur, and then the business model designed around the idea is
validated and structured as the technology venture matures; moreover, as
startups are in continuous search for the best business model fit with
their target market, it is natural that changes in its dimensions occur
over time. The right business model rarely appears in early stages of
ventures (Teece, 2010) and pivoting is neither a target, nor something
to be feared and avoided, but entrepreneurs should have in mind that the
most successful ventures are not the ones with a perfect business model
but those with flexibility that allows changes and readjustments
(Eisenmann et al., 2011; Teece, 2018). Although pivots are not
mandatory, they represent an evolution from the startup perception over
its environment since these shifts are obtained through strategic
learning resulting from opportunity exploration and exploitation (Hitt
et al., 2011; Sirén et al., 2012).

Most of the investigated startups were not systematically adopting LS or
other experimentation-driven practices; rather, they were relying on
heuristics (i.e. intuition, unclear paths and casual attempts to
problem-solving). By doing so, these technology ventures disregard the
importance of building KPIs (key performance indicators) and metrics to
keep track of their startups” development. One risk of such attitude
refers to premature scaling. LS assists entrepreneurs in failing fast
(Ries, 2011), thus saving up scarce resources while learning from their
own mistakes. Without such experimental business model validation,
entrepreneurs run the risk of getting caught in their own overly
positive vision about their startup future and decide to start scaling
up too early → by investing to make the startup grow in terms of people,
organizational units, operations and marketing spending. Any time the
growth in CAPEX and OPEX is not matched by a superior growth in sales,
resulting in a positive margin, the conditions for failure due to the
condition known as “premature scaling” are created (Marmer et al.,
2012).

Despite the strategic literature underscores how business model
experimentation is critical for technology new ventures survival under
high levels of uncertainty (Andries et al., 2013; Dyer et al., 2008;
Patel et al., 2015), some startups still rely on informal interactions
and investigations based on market research developed without real
contact with customers. Entrepreneurs can reduce uncertainty to some
extent by employing a research technique, but the benefits from testing
products and searching for real feedbacks are far more reliable (Andries
et al., 2013; Eisenmann et al., 2011).

Networking is fundamental in every business, and it may be crucial in
the early stages. Global changes toward digitization and rapid-pace
responses have forced organizations to invest time understanding
customers (Euchner, 2017; Ganguly and Euchner, 2018; Power, 2014).
However, entrepreneurs must be aware of the risk of biased feedback and
take into consideration the effects of social influence on opportunity
recognition (McAllister et al., 2018). In this sense, customer
development (Alvarez, 2014; Blank, 2007) or similar systematic
customer-centric approaches can assist entrepreneurs in properly
collecting and interpreting reliable feedbacks.

Technological contexts impose different challenges for the startups and
may entail obstacles to the opportunity exploitation. Drawing on the
findings, Figure 2 represents the constraints hindering LS adoption
experienced by the startups in the study, namely: (1) regulation
requirements; (2) technology/legal uncertainty; (3) contexts with low
tolerance to failures; (4) long-cycle product development; (5)
manufacturing/development costs; and (6) markets with low acceptance to
incremental updates.

Startups may face technology uncertainties leading to product
development taking longer than expected or producing unpredicted
results, also increasing scalability risks (Harms et al., 2015; Holahan
et al., 2014; Kim and Vonortas, 2014). This obstacle was mostly
perceived by the biotechnology startups and explicitly stated by B3,
claiming their product development and scalability has “no proportional
rule.” Furthermore, commercialization of emerging technologies calls for
different regulations (Roca et al., 2017). B1 and E3 reported
difficulties concerning regulation requirements, legal uncertainty and
excessive bureaucracy, slowing the business model validation process and
restricting LS adoption.

The investigation revealed two main hurdles that set the biotechnology
and engineering startups apart from the software ventures: long-cycle
product development and manufacturing costs. These obstacles have direct
implications in MVP building and testing. Engineering breakthroughs or
massive infrastructure deployment may pose a problem in highly
innovative entrepreneurial activities as it diminishes the possibility
of launching products early and often (Eisenmann et al., 2011).
Moreover, both biotechnology and engineering contexts entail
more-expensive components when compared to software startups. This may
represent a financial constraint, resulting in a lack of funds for
innovation and causing forego of technology purchase (Kaufmann and
Tödtling, 2002; Staniewski et al., 2016).

Technology new ventures often operate in volatile environments as they
typically offer innovative products and services. The constraints were
experienced by one or more of the investigated startups from different
backgrounds. The software startups investigated did not mention any
contextual constraint that could hinder LS adoption; however, depending
on the case, they can also be susceptible to some constraints. For
instance, software startups operating in fields with low tolerance to
mistakes (e.g. healthcare) may have to develop more refined MVPs or deal
with limited experimentations. Hence, though these constraints emerged
in nondigital technology ventures, we posit that such obstacles are not
exclusive of biotechnology and engineering fields.

Cross-case analysis and propositions

The cross-case analysis among the ventures from different technology
fields offered an overall view of the findings. Table 3 depicts the
ventures' usage of the tools and the contribution of such tools in their
particular processes of opportunity exploitation (Kuckertz et al.,
2017): (1) developing a product or service based on a perceived
entrepreneurial opportunity (e.g. Marion et al., 2012); (2) structuring
a start-up team (Aldrich and Martinez, 2001); (3) approaching investors,
building networks and gathering financial resources from personal or
external funding (Gartner et al., 2012) and (4) setting up formal
organizational structures (Gartner et al., 2010).

Our critical insight is that technology entrepreneurs adopt diverse
practices to exploit opportunities. LS-related tools and practices → in
the present cases, usability and A/B tests → primarily support
developing a product or a service and gathering financial resources; by
contrast, the other tools and practices supplement LS by supporting the
remaining activities in the opportunity exploitation process. The
empirics from the study afford additional contributions in the form of
propositions and research agenda.

Literature reveals the major role of the economic and institutional
context for boosting or hindering regional entrepreneurship (Del Giudice
et al., 2019; Stam, 2015). Despite different types of
incubators/accelerators with specific modus operandi and strategies to
foster new ventures exist (c.f. Bergek and Norrman, 2008; Hillemane et
al., 2019), there is growing evidence of their pivotal role in LS
adoption. Ghezzi (2019) revealed that most digital startups adopting LS
mentioned incubators/accelerators, workshops, universities and investors
as their sources of information and training on the methodology. On this
matter, the cross-case analysis revealed a pattern concerning the extent
to which the entrepreneurs were aware of experimentation and its
importance in their technology new ventures performances, regardless of
the founders' backgrounds.

S3 revealed being exposed to business model validation methodologies for
the first time during their first startup competition. Next, S3 founders
also reported receiving training courses on LS practices in the
subsequent incubation process, which assisted the team in systematizing
its business model development. S1 and S2, by contrast, adopted
validation practices interchangeably. Despite its limited adoption, S1
acknowledged benefits from the methodology. As to S2, the lack of
comprehensive adoption is due to a large number of tools offered to
digital startups; however, the startup does not implement any of the
proposed methodologies systematically.

The study identified several (technological and institutional)
constraints limiting LS adoption among technology new ventures (Figure
2). Despite not experiencing any of the previous contextual constraints,
two out of the three investigated software startups disregard the
systematic adoption of LS practices or other validation tools, which
leads to the following proposition:Proposition 1. Institutional and
contextual constraints may hinder LS adoption among technology new
ventures.

Strategy and entrepreneurship literature have long addressed the
cognitive benefits of organizational learning (Bingham et al., 2007;
Bingham and Eisenhardt, 2011). Drawing on the psychology research
developed by Ericsson et al. (1993), scholars have underscored the
importance of structured and intense activities focused on the
improvement of current performance, known as deliberate practice. In
this sense, the engagement in such structured efforts affords
entrepreneurs enhanced capacity to assimilate new information with
current knowledge and skills (Corbett, 2005), thus relating to
entrepreneurial learning and venture performance (Baron and Henry,
2010).

Despite deliberate practice generating better performance in more
predictable environments, “efforts to reduce ambiguity, such as
obtaining accurate feedback (from oneself or others) or being socially
astute enough to recognize which decisions/choices were responsible for
their successful (or unsuccessful) selection and execution of influence
behaviors may increase performance” (McAllister et al., 2018, pp.
1942→1943). LS strongly advocates learning from failure, which provides
higher-level outcomes, with revitalized awareness of the entrepreneurs'
abilities and more sophisticated knowledge base (Cope, 2011).
Additionally, LS offers structured and systematic means to iteratively
validate business model elements and enhance the learning process
directly from the market, dubbed by Ries (2011) as validated learning.

Drawing on the cases, most of the investigated technology new ventures
rely on making decisions based on heuristics, intuition and biased
feedback. These startups have poor systematization of metrics and
superficially use their data. B1, for instance, does not make use of
structured metrics and costs. The entrepreneurs leading B2 admitted
“occasionally” developing products based on the team members'
intuitions, and failing.

The software startups reported benefits from experimentation. Though
randomly adopting LS practices, S1 and S2 admitted experimentation
assisted the team in mitigating bias from their initial assumptions. S3,
by contrast, adopts LS practices more comprehensively when compared to
the other software startups, and the entrepreneurs confirmed that
developing hypotheses and testing helped the team ending decisions based
on beliefs and running the startup more assertively. The startup
analyzes the user experience and systematizes the analysis of feedbacks.

Finally, the entrepreneurs running E2 reported that experimentation and
usability tests increased their interpretation abilities to distinguish
more reliable feedbacks. Based on these rationales, we introduce the
following propositions:Proposition 2. The systematic and comprehensive
adoption of LS enhances the acquisition and development of
entrepreneurial experimental capability to assist opportunity
exploitation in technology new ventures.Proposition 3. LS practices
specifically support technology new ventures in the opportunity
exploitation phases of developing a product or service and gathering
financial resources in the pre-seed, seed and early stages of
development.

LS has its origins in the software industry and has been largely studied
within digital startups, with little attention to other technology-based
ventures. Contextual constraints may hinder the comprehensive adoption
of LS by different sorts of technology new ventures. Thus, startups
experiencing contextual constraints may benefit from merging LS adoption
with the traditional business planning (Delmar and Shane, 2003), the
stage-gate approach (Cooper, 1990), simulations (when it is suited) or
similar alternative approaches.

The investigated biotechnology and engineering startups provided
relevant insights regarding their contexts. The authors observed issues
concerning MVP construction as well as business and production
scalabilities due to technology uncertainty in the cases of B1 and B3.
Moreover, the case of B1 disclosed great legal uncertainty regarding its
collection and treatment of material from the Brazilian biodiversity,
which slowed product development and business model validation
processes. To overcome such hurdles, both B1 and B3 concentrated efforts
in further developing their academic research and benefiting from it
later on. As to B3, winning prizes and participating in international
fairs were critical in catching the attention of investors. E3, by
contrast, simultaneously collected feedbacks and adopted a process
similar to the stage-gate approach. These strategies share similarities
with the lab-to-market roadmap for technology translation in
university-based ventures (Bazan, 2019; von Windheim and Myers, 2014)
and stage-gate adaptations for technology developments (Cooper, 2006;
Cooper and Sommer, 2016), in which companies develop technologies while
observing market needs.

Finally, E1 developed a traditional business plan to apply for calls for
grants, which they also considered as an approval of their business
model validation. Based on these findings, we present the final
propositions:Proposition 4. Startups can develop entrepreneurial
capabilities and undertake entrepreneurial activities by adopting
approaches that integrate or substitute lean startup, depending on the
constraints encountered.Proposition 4(a). Startups benefit in
integrating the adoption of lean startup with adaptations of the
lab-to-market or the stage-gate approach to counter the constraints of
technology uncertainty, long-cycle product development and contexts with
low tolerance to failures.Proposition 4(b). Startups benefit in
integrating the adoption of lean startup with business planning to
attract investments and counter higher manufacturing/development costs.

Concluding remarks

This study originally explores how LS practices can support
technology-based new ventures in exploiting opportunities
notwithstanding contextual constraints that may arise. The authors
conducted a multiple-case study with nine Brazilian ventures and
identified contextual constraints that might hinder LS adoption among
three different technology fields, namely: biotechnology, engineering
and software.

The main theoretical contribution of the study, organized in a set of
propositions, concerns the exploration of LS for the process of
opportunity exploitation, in its main phases of developing a product or
service, acquiring human resources, gathering financial resources and
setting up the organization (Kuckertz et al., 2017). This is
particularly important as entrepreneurship research overly focus on
addressing matters of “how much?” rather than “how?” when investigating
new venture growth and “addressing the how is critical because doing so
can provide ventures a roadmap of the actions necessary to expand their
operations quickly” (Shepherd and Patzelt, 2020, p. 1).

The findings showed how traditional LS tools and practices (Ries, 2011;
Blank, 2013) mostly focus on supporting the development of new products
and services as well as the gathering of financial resources phases of
opportunity exploitation. However, contextual constraints hinder the
adoption of LS, depending on the industry the technology new ventures
operate in.

In order to cope with contextual constraints, our study reveals how
startups integrate LS with complementary tools and practices, like
market research, business planning as well as variants of lab-to-market
and the stage-gate approaches, which help them developing products and
services, gathering financial resources as well as setting up the
organization in opportunity exploitation endeavors. Our findings did not
reveal explicit links between LS adoption and the acquisition of human
resources, which leaves room to further investigation of how startups
may effectively and experimentally attract human capital.

Additionally, the study revealed that the comprehensive adoption of LS
can assist entrepreneurs in the development of entrepreneurial
experimental capabilities since LS provides a systematic set of
practices similar to the concept of deliberate practice, in which
entrepreneurs benefit from structured efforts to enhance cognitive
resources and hence improve the overall venture performance.

Moreover, the study also offered practical results. The authors revealed
how LS adoption may be limited among different sorts of technology
fields due to the presence of contextual constraints inherent to some
settings. The study identified six constraints hindering the systematic
adoption of lean startup by the investigated technology new ventures and
revealed several strategies conducted by the startups to overcome
barriers in their early stages.

The study is not free of limitations. The authors adopted an exploratory
qualitative approach, which has limitations regarding generalization. In
an attempt to reduce this limitation, the authors collected data from
ventures in similar fields but in different STPs, which affords
replication logic (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2014). Additionally, by
adopting a multiple-case study, the study augmented the external
validity and reduced the observer bias (Voss et al., 2002). The
qualitative nature of the research limits generalization of populations
but affords generalization of theoretical propositions (Yin, 2014).
Nevertheless, the findings presented in the paper may be useful for
technology new ventures (beyond the digital domain) pursuing repeatable
and scalable business models. Also, entrepreneurial institutions (e.g.
incubators, accelerators) may be aware of the critical role of
disseminating lean startup practices for startups and entrepreneurial
individuals.

The Brazilian emerging economy served as an underlying setting for the
study. Two of the identified constraints to LS in technology new
ventures relate to regulation and legal uncertainty. Previous research
discussed excessive regulatory compliance acting as institutional
barrier and leading to exit hazards for new entrants in emerging
economies (Chang and Wu, 2014). Additionally, institutional support and
environmental turbulence are closed linked to product innovation
strategies in technology new ventures within transitional economies (Li
and Atuahene-Gima, 2014). Thus, legal inefficiency can be seen as a type
of institutional uncertainty (Bylund and McCaffrey, 2017) and may hamper
LS adoption among technology startups. Future research could explore
additional strategies to overcome such constraints under environmental
uncertainties in emerging economies (e.g. Bao et al., 2020).

The study investigated LS adoption by Brazilian technology new ventures,
responding to a recent call on the topic (c.f. Silva et al., 2019) and
shedding light on context influencing startup development
(Amankwah-Amoah and Hinson, 2019; Tripathi et al., 2019). Future studies
should try to replicate the research on different and more mature
settings, also employing quantitative approaches to generate statistical
validation to the propositions.

How K.M. Birla's intervention salvaged the $2.6 bn Aleris deal

MintAsia (India)

August 3, 2018 Friday

Length: 937 words

Body

New Delhi, Aug. 3 -- Till March this year, there was no way that Aditya
Birla Group was getting to acquire Aleris Corp.-an ambition it first
harboured in August 2017 when symptoms of a potential failure started to
crop up between an earlier agreed upon merger between China's Zhongwang
USA LLC and the Cleveland-based American company. Zhongwang was to buy
Aleris for $2.33 billion. The US Department of Justice was closing in on
Liu Zhongtian, majority owner of Zhongwang USA, whose affiliate
Perfectus Aluminium Inc.

was accused of evading $1.5 billion in tariffs by illegally importing
aluminium into the US. This development happened even as president
Donald Trump was readying ground for a trade war with China and sought
ways to turn its economy inwards. Several Chinese takeovers of US
companies faced heightened scrutiny by the Trump administration. In
September, the administration blocked a Beijing-backed fund's attempt to
buy an American chip maker, Lattice Semiconductor Corp. In July, Chinese
conglomerate HNA Group Co.'s planned $416-million purchase of a Los
Angeles in-flight entertainment company, Global Eagle Entertainment
Inc., collapsed because the companies didn't get approval from the
country's Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS). The same
CFIUS refused approval to Zhongwang USA after 27 US senators urged the
Treasury to reject the sale, calling it a "strategic misstep". In
November, Aleris and Zhongwang called off the deal, paving the way for
the 51-yearold Kumar Mangalam Birla to acquire the company for $2.58
billion, making Hindalco the world's second-largest aluminium company
and the world's largest aluminium company outside of China. "There was a
period when talks had almost come to a standstill in Aleris and bankers
were told that the acquisition in all likelihood may not happen," a
person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity. Reason: A
hike in valuation being sought by Aleris, apart from clarity on
regulatory and people-related issues. In fact, this was the second time
the Group was pulling out from the race. The Birla Group had first
evaluated the transaction in 2008 when it was deciding to bid for
Novelis . In 2009, Aleris filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was
acquired by private equity funds Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital
Management, and Sankaty Advisors in the following year. "K.M. Birla
himself stepped in to address some contentious issues...," the person
cited above added. In an interview on 26 July, Birla confirmed that he
had to intervene at some point. "I think it was required and expected.
Our acquisitions are about value-creation," Birla said. Zhongwang was to
buy Aleris for $2.33 billion. So, why did Birla pay a premium-as many
believe? Because, Aleris has made investments of $900 million, which are
yet to reflect in its earnings. In two years, once they start to yield
returns, Hindalco's debt, which will almost double to $6 billion after
this acquisitions, will come down to $3 billion- much below its current
debt of $3.5 billion. That aside, "Most others were only interested in
the US's Lewisport asset while we were also interested in getting into
aerospace and China, which is going to be our biggest synergy," said
Steve Fisher, chief executive of Novelis Inc. Nevertheless, the deal
bore the hallmark of a long tradition of group founders stepping in to
steer negotiations whenever potential acquisitions appeared to collapse,
whether due to differences on valuation or other issues. Another example
of Birla stamping his authority on such crucial issues is one of the
most complex mergers between Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd,
where he proposed to Vodafone Group Plc to merge with Idea Cellular-a
deal for which the British company readily agreed even as it virtually
meant that Vodafone will exit the telecom company business and reap
dividend as a shareholder while Birla will continue to run the show in a
battle for supremacy against Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm
Ltd. "Mr. Birla understands the sensitivities involved at late-stage
negotiation of such cross-cultural transactions and the significant
difference it makes when promoters are involved themselves at such
stage," said Bharat Banka, a former head of Group Finance at Aditya
Birla Group, who now runs a niche business and management consulting
practice. "It cuts down negotiation time significantly and it gives a
different level of comfort to the seller(s) reassuring them of the
seriousness and intent commitment of the buyer," he added. Birla is
playing a similar role with the acquisition of Dalmia Cement now. About
Aleris, Aditya Birla Group had sounded off bankers as early as August
last year about the potential deal. "What worked to the advantage of
Aditya Birla Group is that apart from China's Zhongwang, there were no
bidders for the whole company," said the person cited above. "Aleris
operates close to 40 small and large plants spread across North America,
Europe and Asia. Potential bidders included Japan's Kobe Steel and
India's Vedanta group, but none of them it seems wanted all the
facilities" said the first person cited in the story. "I am not aware of
who the other bidders were but we were given to understand that much of
the interest was centred around the Lewisport plant only, which is the
company's largest facility in North America," said Satish Pai, managing
director of Hindalco.

An investor's guide to successfully raise seed fund for your startup

Here's a compilation of fundamental lessons that every early-stage
startup must go through once. A lot of these lessons are going to help
you throughout your entrepreneurial journey.

The primary goal of any startup is to disrupt the status quo of the
market with a predictable, scalable, and more viable business model.
Startups are by design created to rattle the vertical incumbents and to
create new market verticals altogether.

They are young emerging enterprises that fill gaps with an innovative
approach or eliminate complexities from the ecosystem at large. Agility
is embedded in their inventive thinking as they are in the constant
endeavour to develop the latest breakthrough.

However, early-stage startup founders tend to make several common
mistakes. For instance, nearly all of them love their dreams for the
future, which is good in a way. What's not good is that they do not
learn from the 'Hall of Epic Failures' of other startup founders as they
go about it.

They are on a journey to create history without learning from history.
Perhaps why, a majority of startups end up failing before seeing the
light of day.

So, here's a compilation of fundamental lessons that every early-stage
startup must go through once. A lot of these lessons are going to help
you throughout your entrepreneurial journey.

An unexplainable idea

What's an idea that is not easy to explain or cannot be communicated?

It's precisely that, 'an idea'. However, if you want to take it beyond
the ideation stage and bring it on the drawing board with your potential
investors, you have to make it understandable before the interest fades
out.

In fact, founders typically pitch their technology product and not a
business. You must keep in mind that investors are more interested in
the latter than the former. A complex idea or technological jargons
would make little sense to them.

Building it from the scratch

A lot of things are important in this world. Working on everything at
once from the ground up is not one of them.

While doing so, you might end up overlooking partnerships or overbuild
the product itself. You indeed have greater control over the entire
technological construct with custom codes.

However, it also takes time and often more time than you can afford.
With multiple projects running concurrently, a delay in any one of them
can leave you in a spot.

Everything, from your priorities to your go-to-market strategy, will end
up in chaos. Instead, you must streamline everything and enter into
partnerships wherever possible.

Achievements versus aspirations

A common mistake that founders usually make is hiring people exclusively
based on credentials. Your startup might lack on several fronts if the
people you onboard have no hunger to achieve.

Also, people with credentials can come with the baggage of entitlement,
expectations, existing commitments, and an inflexible style of working.

During your initial market journey, any hire can make or break your
future.

Eating more than they can chew

Though it's good to try to raise funds and be successful at it, eating
more than you can chew is not the best way forward.

Raising more money than you need will make you splurge more. Sooner or
later, you are going to lose financial prudence. Having limited capital
resources, on the other hand, will make you and your team find out
innovative ways to be more cost-effective.

This will also bring a world of difference later during your drive
towards profitability.

Products that no one needs

Every startup founder enters the market with a hypothesis - they are
solving a massive problem that will make every customer go head over
heels.

Based on the initial evidence of success, they go all-in, and their
venture disappears into oblivion shortly after. Such approaches put you
on wrong track.

You have to keep assessing and reassessing your traction during every
successive phase of your market journey. Always make sure that the
market for your product exists and keeps on existing as you expand.

Frugality in the trash can

Such founders care little about finance, cash flows, and prudent use of
funds. They spend recklessly, and that too, on things that have little
to no financial dividend.

It could be anything - from fancy office furniture to parties,
promotions, or customer acquisition drives - that cause nosebleed to
their ventures. They feel they are not accountable. What they forget is
that market is a time capsule that makes them a case study of what not
to become, acquire, or hire.

Too early, too big

The startup can get choked serving a big customer. The bigger the
client, the more resources it will consume to develop and deliver the
product. It will also take time.

Since the startup is in its early stages, the founder even starts
customising the products and services for the big customer, creating
financial dependency.

Superman founders/Lone rangers

These type of founders are lone rangers. They're very good at something,
but they are equally miserable while working with a team. They rarely
trust and do not delegate.

At the end of the day, every founder is a human. No one has unlimited
hours or the energy to solve everything. Such startups face challenges
while scaling and often stumble upon decision fatigue.

Raising money from wrong investors

Raising capital is tough. However, it becomes lethal if you end up doing
so from toxic investors with no reputation whatsoever.

Early-stage startups are fragile, and there's a lot of nurturing that
needs to be done. Your investor is not merely someone who injects
capital into your business. They also have to be good mentors and help
their portfolio companies get in ship shape. They are also pivotal in
driving market tie-ups.

Income generation, not wealth creation

Your first and foremost priority should be the financial health of your
startup. At early stages, founders who have raised capital starve the
business and feed salaries to themselves. It is barely a surprise that
the business suffers as a result and fails.

Indeed, you cannot do away with salary, but make sure to keep it for
sustenance as much as possible. If your startup succeeds, you anyway are
going to be the biggest beneficiary. Don't starve your high-potential
business for petty cash.

Multiple trains of thought

Startups, trying to offer everything to all customer segments, do not
scale for a reason. Such businesses can neither build expertise nor can
they create a leadership position for themselves.

At the same time, their revenue model becomes too complex, the business
heads in multiple unrelated directions, and there is a whole ball of wax
in terms of challenges.

Tech perfect from Day 1

It's not bad for seed-stage startups to aspire for a world-class
offering. If you're on a spending spree while buying technology and
recruiting people without engaging your customers, it is a recipe for
disaster.

There should be customer validation for your MVP. Otherwise, the capital
and manhours invested are technically written off. Also, do not get your
MVP validated by the investors only to keep them happy. If you're doing
so, it is by and large the same thing.

Cost and pricing issues, weak business model, and me-too offerings

There should be a visible path to profitability. Having cost and pricing
issues or a weak business model will not serve the purpose. Me-too
offerings should also be avoided to the very extent possible.

It is because every business has different priorities at different
stages of growth, you might have a different set of priorities and value
proposition than the business or service that you want to emulate.
Simply avoid doing it.

Building a castle without a moat

Back in the day, moats served a purpose. It was to protect the castle
from all sides and prevent the entry of an invader, thereby giving a
strategic advantage in terms of defence.

Your moat is your unique IP or the barrier(s) to entry that others might
experience. They help you in not getting out-competed by other new
market entrants. It will give you enough time to spot and prepare to
topple your competition as and when it appears.

Equity allocation

Early-stage startup founders often do not understand the importance of
the equity cap table. It makes them dole out large chunks of
double-digit equity to employees, consultants, and advisors.

The equity is further granted without vesting and understanding the
buyback options. Any cap table with heavy dilution drives the venture
capital away. If you're compensating with equity, you are financing your
business in the costliest way possible.

Launching a product ahead of its time

If your timing is not right, it's the end of the story. You cannot make
your business linger in the market for several years or decades. How
will you manage finances till then?

In fact, studies indicate that timing is the telling difference between
successful and unsuccessful startups about 42 percent of the time. So,
if you have an unconventional idea, perhaps it's time to get back to the
drawing board.

Cash burn

If you try and remember, a lot of startups, including unicorns, are no
longer functional. A majority of the time it is because they were
burning cash with no definitive plan of action.

After a point in time, they are bound to run out of capital, and
investors are no longer ready to fuel their splurges. They simply did
not meet the milestones that were a part of their term sheet - the Bible
investors swear by. You must focus on your 'Zero Cash Date.'

Keep it transparent and align everyone with it in the company. Also,
keep all investors, including F&F, updated every 30 to 60 days.

Thinking that they are always right

Why did Nokia fail? It was the biggest phone company at a time. A few
years down the line, it was in shambles with its CEO shedding tears in a
news conference. The reason was that Nokia created an army of 'Yes Men'
who did little to bring about changes that would've transformed the
company.

Smart entrepreneurs surround themselves with smart people, and they
listen to them. Don't become overconfident about your prospects and
naive about your problems.

Make your employees feel valued and use their counsel. Even if you
initially do not agree with their suggestion, try to see things from
their perspective. What if you might have not considered something that
they did?

the mistakes of others

Uncalculated risks

Risks are a part of the business that need to be taken at some point or
the other. However, make sure if you have to take a risk, it is a
well-calculated one. Some of the smartest founders I've come across can
visualise every angle of a problem, and all potential outcomes.

If you're going for a pivot, don't do so without weighing the pros and
cons. Otherwise, you'd not be doing what prompted your investors to
invest money in your startup. Also, avoid taking too many major steps at
a single time.

The startup limbo

It's easy to lose track after a few months or years of starting the
business. But it's also why not everyone is an entrepreneur. The idea is
interesting initially and keeps the founders motivated. However, when a
lot of water has flown under the bridge, the enthusiasm starts
diminishing, there's no excitement at work, and self-sabotaging
tendencies start propping up.

In other words, the startup has neither failed nor succeeded. It's just
in a never-ending state of limbo with no progress whatsoever. You have
to be mentally strong and resilient with the power to make decisions
that need to be made. If it is so, don't get yourself into the sunk-cost
fallacy and start afresh - but treat it as your last option.

In a nutshell, all startup founders should avoid these mistakes and make
emotionally intelligent decisions that change the fate of the market and
the people that the startup is associated with.

How to build a strong sales team with a tight startup budget

Sales are revenue-getters. Giving enough importance to sales strategy,
hiring and upskilling will help new startups scale their business.

One of the many reasons startups fail is due to the poor quality of
their sales teams. Most tech entrepreneurs have an engineering
background, and thus lack the professional know-how of effectively
building a sales team. They encounter obstacles when it comes to
amplifying visibility to a target audience. They often ignore the
significance of building an effective and brilliant sales team, as it
holds equal importance as building a brilliant tech team. According to a
report by IBM Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90
percent Indian startups fail within the first five years.

Sales are in effect the revenue getters for any startup. Early stage
companies, amidst the perplexity of making crucial business decisions
sometimes end up hiring amateurs to lead their sales efforts. 84 percent
of companies in India were affected by bad hiring, revealed a study
conducted by global human resource consultancy CareerBuilder. The cost
of one single bad recruitment could be over Rs 20 lakh, added the
survey.

Founders of smaller startups with a shoe-string budget are hesitant
about hiring expensive sales representatives. However, analysing the
value of sales prospects versus the expense of hiring will help
businessmen take the right decisions when it comes to hiring.

It is important to understand the concept of sales before a startup
begins the process of interviewing, hiring and assessing a salesperson
to avoid troublesome situations. A sale is basically the art of closing
a deal, and mastering this art will get you closer to your business
goals. A successful business strategy does not end with building an
innovative product but also building an effective sales team. It may be
a cliche but a true entrepreneur not only knows how to build a product
but also how to sell it. Sales is not limited to customers' only, as the
entrepreneur has to also sell their ideas to prospective investors as
well. Once you have developed a knack for selling products, guiding the
sales team will be easier, and more focussed.

The success and failure of a startup are largely dependent on the
capability of its sales team. No matter how tech-savvy and disruptive
your product is, if you don't know how to sell it well, soon you will
have to put those shutters down.

Make your sales team a high performing one

* Startups often delegate the responsibilities of a salesperson to
existing employees owing to budget constraints. However, when an
organisation attains a certain level of growth, then client meetings,
inbound/outbound calls, request for demos, presentations, etc suddenly
soar. This calls for an investment of time and resources in hiring a
specialised salesperson who will help you leverage your opportunities.

* Good salespeople are very expensive, and therefore the process of
hiring calls for rigorous due diligence. Someone with past good
experience in selling products might not necessarily be the right fit
for your company, or product. Apart from the fact that he/she has the
knack of selling, the individual must have a desire to attain the next
level in sales, engage productively with customers, and take relevant
feedback on products.

* You can't wash your hands off your responsibilities even after
building the sales team until you see the impact of the sales team on
your company's revenue. Keep an eye on the team, interact with them
almost every day, give feedback, and listen to suggestions to ensure
constant improvement in the sales team.

* A VP sales for a young startup might be an absolute necessity, yet
consider several things first - Remember and ensure that the high salary
is within your purview. Take into account that prior experience in a
well-established organisation can sometimes be a challenge in meeting
the dynamic goals of another organisation.

* Since the sales team is the one to persuade potential clients,
educating them about the products in detail is a top priority, before
they actually start selling products. Salespersons should be armed with
comprehensive product knowledge to identify the client's problems and
solve them. And to track their performance, they should be able to
leverage online tools.

* To motivate salespeople, you need to reward high performers, thereby
attracting other employees to follow their examples.

* Sales can be quite diversified, and can be broken down into inside
sales, field sales, client services, lead generation, etc. The type of
sales will determine the criteria for selection such as past experience
and background.

* Startups founders often fall for a charming personality, and this has
little to do with the ability and intent to sell products. A wise
decision would be to do due diligence of past successes in accomplishing
tasks, and successfully closing a large number of deals.

* The concept of gamification is really catching on when it comes to
training and motivating the sales team. With millennials dominating the
workplace, engaging sales staff in the learning process using gaming
techniques actually plays a crucial role in motivating and improving
sales training methods. Gamification actually infuses the interest of
self-learning in sales representatives, readying them to excel in the
competitive world. A report by MarketsandMarkets revealed that Sales
Performance Management (SPM) services is expected to double to $5.6
billion by 2020 which includes gamification products that focus on sales
acceleration.

* Embracing e-learning is one of the most effective ways to educate
sales staff on new products, procedures, handling client issues and
understanding how the products and services will benefit the customers.
E-learning enables sales staff to educate themselves with the content
readily available on the internet.

* The sales training sessions should be short and crisp. No matter how
interesting the content of the training is, staff can focus only for
15-20 minutes at a stretch. The attention span is getting shorter and
shorter, therefore the training session should be short, engaging and
easy to understand.

Building a sales team from scratch requires many elements to come
together, but it's worth spending time on developing a plan that will
take you to the next level. Adequate sales training should be the
priority among all other factors, without which the team will stagger,
and the business growth will come to a halt.

One of the crucial ways to sustain new and seasoned talent is to conduct
training on a regular basis. An incredible sales team will definitely
increase the possibility of scaling your startup into a successful and
established organisation.

Georgia : Horticulture research yields light bulb moments in the
improvement of greenhouse growing

The illuminated light bulb. Its the symbol of a great idea come to life.
Erico Mattos big idea doesnt reinvent that iconic bulb exactly but
reimagines how it can be used.

Around the globe, greenhouses grow fruits and vegetables to provide a
healthy food supply year-round. But as reliable as the sun is for
providing light and energy for plants to grow, a rainy day or just a
cloudy afternoon can slow a plants growth little by little. Those cloudy
days add up and can affect how quickly a plant grows including how deep
its roots take holdand how much it can produce. Some greenhouse growers
use artificial lighting. But to shine a light on a plant thats already
getting ample sunlight is a waste of energy and money.

After finishing his doctorate in bioengineering at the University of
Georgia, Mattos teamed up with Marc van Iersel, the Dooley Professor of
Horticulture, to develop a lighting controller that can respond to
sunlight and provide just enough supplemental light to keep plants
happy. The lights dim under sunny conditions and get brighter under
cloudy conditions.

We provide the plants just the amount of light that they need, says
Mattos. No more. No less.

The idea has the potential to give the nearly $15 billion greenhouse
farming industry a reliable, energy-saving process, which could ensure
peak growth and profit margins and provide a more stable global food
supply. Or at least thats what Mattos suspected. Still, he wasnt
entirely sure if his lab work would translate into the real-world needs
of greenhouse growers.

This could have been a really cool idea and a bunch of academic papers,
van Iersel says. Instead, Mattos and van Iersel committed to bringing
the idea to market by creating a startup. They named their company
Candidus, Latin for radiant.

Finding a path to success

Mattos and van Iersel turned to a UGA program thats helping faculty and
students take their big ideas and entrepreneurial aspirations and
pressure test them for the market. Innovation Corps, or I-Corps, was
developed by the National Science Foundation to help scientists and
engineers in the U.S. extend their academic research for economic and
societal benefits. At UGA, teams go through a six-week accelerator
program to identify market need and potential customers for their idea.

Its an important step, says Ian Biggs, director of the Startup Program
within UGAs Innovation Gateway, the universitys instrument for
commercializing UGA research.

Across industries, the failure rate for startup companies is grim, 90%
by some estimates. But data show 40% fail because customers dont need or
at least think they dont needwhats being sold.

You are going to fail if you have something that nobody cares about,
says Biggs. If he sounds blunt, its from years of experience in
entrepreneurship and startups on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Before coming to Athens, the Oxford-educated Biggs worked in finance for
several international banks and was part of a handful of animal breeding
startups including the team that brought the worlds first cloned sheep,
Dolly, to life.

A flourishing ecosystem

As rapidly as technology seems to be evolving, the process for bringing
university ideas to consumers has gotten more complex, Biggs says. Years
ago, big industry partners would shop around for the best ideas in
academia and then buy the rights to take those ideas, potentially
prototype them, and then determine if they were market ready. These
days, companies are less likely to invest in ideas unless they are sure
things. Through its Innovation District initiative, UGA is stepping up
to help faculty and students develop their research to have the greatest
impact on society.

The success in this effort speaks for itself. Last year, UGA ranked
first among 193 U.S. institutions for the number of commercial products
reaching the market, according to a survey released by the nonprofit
AUTM, which tracks technology transfer. In the same survey, UGA ranked
fourth in the number of new intellectual property licenses executed to
industry. So far, the bulk of that success comes from existing companies
licensing UGA technology, but the university is strengthening its
efforts to support startup companies based on university research.

Connecting with customers

I-Corps is a key first step for faculty entrepreneurs, and its the
perfect Startup 101 course for academics.

Hour after hour, year after year, scientists painstakingly commit to
their research and their ideas. For Mattos, it was time spent
understanding how plants respond and grow in light and how to measure
and monitor that response.

When you are really passionate about something, you think your work,
your technology, will save the world, says Mattos. That doesnt mean the
market is ready for it yet.

Since 2017, 62 groups have gone through the I-Corps program. The ideas
are diverse, ranging from using drone technology to assess animal health
to using recycled plastics for modular homes, from a vaccine additive to
reduce side effects to a better delivery system for probiotics. One
graduate of the program is the all-female team of engineers that
launched Can I Recycle This?

Co-founder Katherine Shayne developed an artificial intelligence-based
system to educate consumers on what can or cannot be recycled in their
area and how to do it properly. Shayne and the rest of the team were
able to determine a potential path to create a sustainable company.
Theyre currently developing their software and working with potential
municipal and industry partners to help consumers understand whats
recyclable.

Without this program, you would have research and innovation that just
sits there and isnt used, says Shayne. Without the lessons we learned in
I-Corps, I dont think it would be what it is as a company. We knew we
had a support system.

it can be a very defeating feeling when you do not succeed. Have you
checked if you have made some wrong choices that may have set you up for
failure from the start of the day?

There has been a lot of emphases laid on the first meal of the day. Most
dieticians agree that skipping breakfast is not an option at all. You
could combine breakfast with lunch by having it a little late -- brunch
-- if you please. But to not break your night's fast would not work well
for your energy levels. The risk is that you may wait till you're
ravenous and then overeat.

But If you're feeling hungry within a couple of hours of eating the
breakfast, feel bloated or fatigued, it may be time to switch up your
first meal of the day, says a report in the Sun.com (UK). 

Here's a troubleshooting guide to see if you are making any mistakes
that are setting you up for failure through your breakfast choices.

6 common breakfast mistakes:

-   Eating too much sugar: Check your breakfast menu. Are you taking
    shortcuts to save time... eating croissants, cereals and baked
    goods? Or having orange juice that is swimming with the sweet stuff
    because it is of a brand that contains added sugar. To avoid the
    empty calories, make sure the label says 100 per cent juice on it.
    You could also dilute your drink with water. But seriously, the best
    choice would be to choose whole fruit over juice purely because it
    has more fibre, less sugar, and fewer calories. And those baked
    goods, ready-to-eat cereals, and biscuits... may taste delicious,
    but will do nothing for your waistline thanks to their hidden sugar
    content. The Sun quotes Rob Hobson, a London-based nutritionist and
    head of Healthspan, who says, "If you eat too much sugar you
    obviously increase your risk of putting on weight and you could end
    up with sugar highs and lows... If you have a sugar spike followed
    by a sugar low, you might look around for sugary foods to bring you
    back up again." Read nutritional labels on cereals packages to spot
    the worst offenders. Dietician Dr Carrie Ruxton also told Sun.com
    that, "Many sugary, low fibre breakfast cereals just take the edge
    off your appetite, leaving you hunting for snacks a couple of hours
    later."Eating too many 'empty' calories: First up, understand what
    are 'empty' calories. "All foods contain calories, and all calories
    are either used by your body for immediate energy, stored away as
    glycogen as a source of future energy or turned into fat - depending
    on how many calories you eat during a period of time," explains
    Leslie Ramirez, a clinical dietitian at Houston Methodist (USA). As
    a rule of thumb, if a food does not contain nutrients or if the
    calories from sugar and fats outweigh the nutrients found in the
    food, it's considered to be a source of empty calories. Sources of
    empty calories include Soft drinks, sports drinks, sweet tea,
    lemonade and energy drinks, Alcohol, Junk food and fast food, Candy,
    including hard candies and sweet or sour chews, Cakes and doughnuts,
    etc. Dr Mayur Ranchordas, an exercise physiologist and sports
    nutritionist at Sheffield Hallam (UK) told Sun.com that it's
    important to watch how calories can add up at breakfast. "If you had
    a full-fat latte or cappuccino with a muffin, you might think 'I
    only had a coffee and muffin for breakfast'... But that's loads of
    calories and no nutritional value. That's 700-800 calories at
    breakfast. But watch the portion sizes and the number of servings
    when you opt for healthier menus like poached eggs, or smoked
    salmon, or avocado, or chicken sandwich etc. at lunch, you could
    exceed your daily calorie intake before dinner."Not getting enough
    protein or fats: Make sure you are not skimping on the protein
    content. Proteins not only helps you build muscles but may also help
    you keep your appetite in check later in the day. But do not load
    your plate with non-vegetarian pizza or processed meat sausages on
    the rebound. Choose leaner options that are better for your heart,
    like soybeans, pumpkin seeds, peanuts, chickpeas, cottage cheese,
    edamame beans, quinoa, almonds, Greek yoghurt, Dahi, nut butter,
    paneer, or milk. Choose skimmed milk with the least amount of fats.
    The key to a healthy breakfast is making sure it has a little of
    everything - protein, fats and carbohydrates. Most breakfasts fail
    on this requirement and then one faces hunger or cravings within a
    couple of hours. Having greasy fry-ups: Are you reaching out for
    comfort foods that are too calorie-rich? Sun.com aptly points out
    that bacon, sausages, eggs and more are divine on a hangover. A
    smaller amount of fat is okay but "A greasy fry up is full of
    saturated fat, loads of calories and makes you feel sluggish, make
    you susceptible to graver health issues like hypertension and cancer
    due to their heavy salt content and processed food contents. Wolfing
    down food while on the go: When you're in a rush to start your day,
    you might scarf your breakfast down in a hurry, too. Speedy eating
    can raise the odds of obesity against you. But instead, if you can
    slow down and savour each bite of breakfast, it could make you more
    aware of whether you're actually hungry or not -- and that can help
    you avoid overeating. Avoid 'time-saving' tricks like eating
    breakfast while rushing into work or sitting at the desk. Find ten
    minutes to eat in peace and mindfully. Or face weight gain and
    indigestion. Waiting until you are starving: You must not wait until
    you are ravenous because it could lead you to reach for something
    unhealthy. But you can plan your mealtime in advance and also get
    the benefits of Intermittent Fasting by planning ahead. Dr Mayur
    tells Sun.com that there isn't enough science to back up the overly
    hyped importance given to breakfast. He said: "Most people are quite
    overweight and have a high fasting blood glucose level. Skipping
    breakfast might be healthy for those people. If you eat your last
    meal at 7 pm - and it's rice, carbs, pasta - then go to sleep at 11
    pm, then don't eat till lunchtime, you've fasted for 16 hours.
    That's quite good for you, as you are controlling insulin and blood
    sugar levels."

    shortcuts to save time... eating croissants, cereals and baked
    goods? Or having orange juice that is swimming with the sweet stuff
    because it is of a brand that contains added sugar. To avoid the

2.  Eating too much sugar: Check your breakfast menu. Are you taking

    goods? Or having orange juice that is swimming with the sweet stuff
    because it is of a brand that contains added sugar. To avoid the
    empty calories, make sure the label says 100 per cent juice on it.
    You could also dilute your drink with water. But seriously, the best
    choice would be to choose whole fruit over juice purely because it
    has more fibre, less sugar, and fewer calories. And those baked
    goods, ready-to-eat cereals, and biscuits... may taste delicious,
    but will do nothing for your waistline thanks to their hidden sugar
    content. The Sun quotes Rob Hobson, a London-based nutritionist and
    head of Healthspan, who says, "If you eat too much sugar you
    obviously increase your risk of putting on weight and you could end
    up with sugar highs and lows... If you have a sugar spike followed
    by a sugar low, you might look around for sugary foods to bring you
    back up again." Read nutritional labels on cereals packages to spot
    the worst offenders. Dietician Dr Carrie Ruxton also told Sun.com

WHAT SHOULD YOU EAT GUILT-FREE?

Yoghurt, whole fruits, foods that are high on protein, good fibre and

prefers an omelette with black coffee to chase it down, and a snack of
nuts and a piece of fruit if you are hungry later. "That's around 450
calories by lunchtime", Dr Mayur adds.

[Startup Bharat] Indore-based Bingage is empowering restaurants with its
AI-based marketing suite

Bingage's AI-based marketing suite caters to over 600 restaurants across
18 cities in India. Until February 2020, it has delivered around 3.1
million personalised campaigns, with a team of 10 employees.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the restaurant industry is among the
worst-hit. According to the National Restaurant Association of India
(NRAI), which represents over 500,000 restaurants across the country,
over 20 lakh people directly employed in the restaurant industry may be
rendered jobless.

"When the lockdown was announced, the restaurant industry was one of the
worst-hit. A lot of chefs, waiters, and small businesses lost their job.
Around 25 percent of restaurants listed on Zomato shut down during the
lockdown itself, while 20-25 percent of dine-in restaurants were never
going to start again even after the lockdowns were lifted," Gaurav
Padiyar, Founder and CEO of Bingage, tells YourStory.

The only silver lining for the sector were cloud kitchens
andself-operated online ordering platforms that operated even during the
peak of the lockdown in March and April. As per RedSeer Management
Consulting, the cloud kitchen(online ordering) market is projected to
become a $2 billion industry in India by 2024, up from $400 million in
2019.

Meanwhile, as per a Gartner report, the overall customer management
software (CRM) market in India stands at $462.7 million, with an annual
growth rate of 20.5 percent.

Understanding the capabilities of both the markets, Gaurav decided to
start Bingage, aB2B SaaS platform that provides restaurants and hotel
owners with customer retention services. Based out of Indore, Madhya
Pradesh, the startup's AI-powered marketing suite is catering to over
600 restaurants across 18 cities in India. Until February 2020, it has
delivered around 3.1 million personalised campaigns, with a team of 10
employees.

A story of trial and errors

Gaurav says the startup's journey is filled with successes and failures.
Bingage started as a small business that sold offline coupon books back
in 2014. Upon realising that the business was not scalable in the
future, Gaurav modified the business model to a food recommendation app
in 2016.

Meanwhile, since the startup was bootstrapped, he found it hard to spend
on marketing budgets for acquiring more active users.

"The hardest time for my team was between January 2016 and October 2017.
I lost lakhs of rupees in this business. Many people advised me to shut
down the business and take up a marketing job. However, I kept going,"
Gaurav shares.

At the same time, he came across an opportunity that would give the
startup the necessary boost.

"In January 2016, I called up the owner of Hotel Sensation, Amit Banke.
I explained the benefits of Bingage app to him. He bought the idea and I
managed to sell out 500 memberships (Rs 2,500 each) from his hotel. Then
more contracts followed - Ozone Restaurants, Jal Restaurants, Regenta
Resorts - all from Indore. We managed to break-even," the founder adds.

Having learned from their previous mistakes, the team at Bingage started
working on other scalable ideas apart from the business of selling hotel
and food coupons on the startup's app. It decided to build a customer
retention platform for the hotel industry.

From coupons to food recommendations, Indore-based Bingage evolved to
become an AI-powered marketing suite that helps hotels and restaurants
retain their customers.

Since February 2018, Bingage has been providing a cutting-edge AI
platform to restaurants to help drive new sales, increase customer
retention, and run impactful campaigns. The platform is made easy-to-use
for restaurant owners since many of them are not acquainted with the
latest technology.

Besides that, Bingage provides a Wallet gateway - a single plug-in API
to start a virtual wallet for any business.By using the e-wallet,
restaurant owners can start their own cashback programme and lure more
customers. According to Gaurav, the startup's cashback programmes have
increased the customer retention rateby two-fold for hotel owners.

In April 2018, Bingage raised a seed fund of Rs 250,000 from Walkover
Web Solutions.

Impact of pandemic

"Until January 2020, Bingage achieved a 200 percent growth year on
year.However, 200 percent isn't a parameter because, in the second year
of any business, you obviously do double than your previous year. So we
focussed on some unique strategies and built strong domain expertise,"
Gaurav explains.

Due to the pandemic, the startup is down to 150 percent for this
financial year. The challenge for Bingage was to keep the business
afloat while paying salaries, as well as keeping the team motivated at
the same time.

Bingage started onboarding retail and supermarkets, which helped them to
keep the sales going. In fact, in April 2020, there were zero sales in
restaurants and retail verticals.

"It was due to the support from my team that we managed to keep new
sales growth by 20 percent in May 2020 through retail and supermarkets.
By July, we had reached 60 percent of the sales revenue of February
2020," he says.

According to the founder this feat was achieved in a short period,
thanks to the previous failures in the startup's journey. "I now
understand why those failures were so important. They taught me to
modify and evolve with circumstances," Gaurav adds.

Learnings from the pandemic

For Gaurav, the pandemic taught him three major lessons -

1. Market acceptance for online platforms: Due to the pandemic-induced
lockdowns, many offline restaurants, hotels, and grocery vendors became
open to digital platforms.

2. The need for personalised customer engagement: When a customer is not
at the store, a personal touch with the customer is challenging. There's
a good chance now that customer engagement platforms will increase as
more businesses go digital.

3. Outlook towards inbound sales: Earlier, especially in India, for
companies who were offering solutions for offline businesses, it used to
be mandatory to hire field sales teams to close the leads. But now the
scenario has changed.Small businesses are also prepared to schedule an
online meeting. Businesses can now go for inbound sales that save time,
energy, and money.

Moving forward

Bingage is now determined to achieve 10x growth by April 2021. Post the
lockdowns, many offline businesses are opening their online stores, and
Bingage is pushing for its Wallet plug-in feature among such stores.

"We have tied-up with IT companies to integrate the Wallet plug-in in
ecommerce stores that they develop for their clients. This has helped us
manage a large portion of our losses since online ordering is the new
norm," shares Gaurav.

How Can Enterprises Benefit From No Code AI

Business World

Just as food enthusiasts across the world are dabbling with ideas such
as pizza without cheese or no-meat chicken dishes, the global IT
industry is witnessing the emergence of "No-code development." However,
the purpose of both is similar, and that is to build the products of
interest with readily available resources and consume them guilt-free.

When we talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a no-coding
perspective, it is mostly about utilizing a no-code platform to deploy
AI and Machine Learning (ML) models to develop high-end IT products.
Such products are top-rated in instantly classifying, retrieving, and
clause the required data for Business Intelligence (BI).

There is no doubt about digital technology taking over business
practices entirely in the near future but the road to reach that
destination is already open to tread. With the concept of no-code AI,
companies (big and small) can already start working on their
big-bang-business ideas without waiting to pool financial resources.
Here is some food for thought on how no-code AI can transform your
business:

Plug and play resources

No-code platforms offer an exciting opportunity to individuals sans IT
knowledge to build flawless AI-based IT products such as mobile apps,
websites, and other software that can be deployed easily within
businesses. Companies or subject matter experts can build their own
intelligent AI solutions to achieve a goal without coding. The drag and
drop feature of no-code platforms enables companies or individuals to
use plug-and-play resources and build a product with readily available
block codes. All this is done without the need to pour in any coding
language expertise.

Lets you fail fast

In the world of startups, failures play a crucial role in their success
journeys. Many experts recommend entrepreneurs fail fast if they want to
become successful fast. But how will you fail fast if the product you
wish to launch takes forever to launch? Usually, startups go slow with
their plan because they want to ensure their product development is
going on the right path, plus there is no time and money to experiment.
No-code platforms help you dabble with your idea within a limited budget
and time, so you can develop until you build that one product that
changes the world!

Go-to-market faster than before

Technology can be complex, especially when one doesn't have the right
expertise. Finding and retaining the right technology expert to build
the desired application can take too much of your time, impacting the
timespan of the product launch. Here, no-code AI can empower the
companies to create the desired products within a predefined timeline
and execute the go-to-market plan faster than scheduled.

Pocket-friendly

Not just time, no-code platforms are an excellent means of saving IT
costs as well. Focusing only on what is necessary, companies can reduce
the development cost by a significant margin. The platforms also ensure
timely updates and other tasks necessary to upkeep the software without
any intervention of a special resource hire.

No-code AI offers infinite business opportunities to companies,
irrespective of their size and IT budget. Companies can further find
innovative ways to embrace no-code AI to emerge as the frontrunners of
their respective industries. If you haven't explored the possibilities
of what no-code AI is capable of, it is the best time to do so!

Welcome to the Trading Day blog for Tuesday, February 16. Australian hit
their best close in almost 12 months with BHP and other miners rallying.
Fortescue leadership changes came after Iron Bridge project blowout.
World markets extended gains overnight, while Wall Street was closed for
Presidents Day. Earnings season continues. Results are from BHP, Ansell,
Breville, Sims, Domain Group, Brambles and GWA, among others. The RBA
released the minutes of its February board meeting.

7.40pm: Glencore hit by massive write-offs

Anglo-Swiss mining giant Glencore said on Tuesday it plunged deeper into
the red last year, hit by the "extraordinary" challenge of Covid-19 and
massive write-offs, especially on a mine closure in Zambia.

The company said it had a 2020 net loss of $1.9 billion after writing
off assets worth $5.9 billion, compared with a 2019 net loss of $404
million following writedowns costing $2.4 billion.

Sales tumbled 34 percent to $142 billion, it added.

The coronavirus pandemic and the impact on the global economy amounted
to an "extraordinary" challenge for the company which mines and trades
basic raw materials globally.

Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg said in a statement the global economy was
in recession in the first half of 2020, followed by a strong rebound in
the second half.

The trading arm of the company saw operating profit soar 41 percent to
$3.3 billion, reflecting the huge volatility of metal and oil prices.

However, the mining arm reported an operating profit fall of 13 percent
to $7.8 billion, it said.

5.50pm: Tokyo closes higher

Tokyo stocks closed higher on Tuesday as investors kept a bullish
outlook with Japan preparing to start coronavirus vaccinations, fuelling
hopes for economic normalisation.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 1.28 percent, or 383.60 points, to
end at 30,467.75, while the broader Topix index advanced 0.57 percent,
or 11.14 points, to 1,965.08.

The Nikkei on Monday had closed above 30,000 for the first time since
1990. "There are some concerns on the upward trend, but (Tokyo shares)
are likely to go higher as details about vaccination are revealed,"
Rikiya Takebe, senior strategist at Okasan Online Securities.

4.45pm: Best ASX close in almost 12 months

Australia's sharemarket surged to its highest daily close in almost 12
months amid buoyant global markets and a mostly positive domestic
earnings season.

The S&P/ASX 200 index closed up 48.4 points or 0.7 per cent at 6917.3,
its best daily close since February 24th 2020.

The index was just 3.9 per cent below its record high of 7197.2 reached
on February 20th 2020.

While Chinese and US markets remained closed for holidays, UK and
European markets rose strongly on vaccine optimism and falling COVID
case numbers.

That flowed through to the APAC region where S&P 500 futures rose 0.7
per cent and Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1.9 per cent.

WTI crude rose an additional 1.3 per cent rise in WTI crude to $US60.22
a barrel as the "arctic freeze" in Texas shut more than a million
barrels a day of crude output and 3 million barrels of refining
capacity.

Energy was the strongest sector with Woodside up 2.3 per cent and Origin
Energy up 3.9 per cent.

Industrials were next strongest with Transurban up 4.4 per cent, Sydney
Airport up 1.6 per cent and Qantas up 2.6 per cent as investors bet on
economic reopening after Victoria's latest lockdown.

Among other "reopening trades", Vicinity Centres rose 4.9 per cent,
Flight Centre rose 4 per cent and Webjet gained 3.2 per cent.

CSL and Ansell boosted the Health Care sector with gains of 2 per cent
and 1.8 per cent respectively.

BHP rose 2.7 per cent after its interim dividend beat expectations by
about 20 per cent and Rio Tinto rose 3 per cent before its report this
week.

But Fortescue Metals dived 3 per cent after axing key staff over cost
blow out at its Iron Bridge Magnetite project.

Banks rose strongly after NAB's trading update showed improved margins
and a big fall in bad debt provisions.

But while Bendigo Bank surged 6.8 per cent on upgrades, the major banks
trimmed their early gains with NAB 1.1 per cent and CBA downl 0.5 per
cent ex-dividend.

ZIP Co surged 10 per cent and said there was nothing new to report after
"speeding ticket" from the ASX.

3.40pm: Bitcoin hits fresh record high

Bitcoin rose as much as 3.6 per cent at a fresh record high of
$US49913.45 in APAC trading.

AUD/USD earlier hit a 5-week high of US78.05c, at which point it was up
0.3 per cent since the NY close. It came as the US dollar remained under
pressure amid reflation bets.

Bloomberg's US dollar index fell 0.1 per cent to a 3-week low of
1120.83.

3.14pm: Tabcorp behind the scenes details emerge

Fresh details have emerged about the contest playing out behind the
scenes amongst parties keen to buy parts of the $9.93 billion Australian
betting company Tabcorp.

The understanding is that the valuation of a cash bid put forward in
recent weeks by private equity firm Apollo Global Management for all
components of the company except its lotteries division sits at
somewhere between $3bn and $3.5bn.

Apollo, now known to be working with law firm Gilbert + Tobin as well as
Jefferies, is said to have recently reiterated its bid to the Tabcorp
board.

It comes after DataRoom revealed this week that Ladbrokes' British
parent company Entain is offering $3bn cash for the Tabcorp Wagering and
Media division, whilst keeping the door open for a potential alternative
partial scrip offer.

The understanding is that the Tabcorp board has aspirations to achieve a
price of at least $3.5bn for the Wagering and Media unit.

Apollo is also offering to purchase Tabcorp's gaming division, which is
estimated to be worth about $500m, along with the Wagering and Media
operation, for which Citi analysts recently said could be worth up to
$3bn.

However, market experts believe that selling the gaming division, which
leases, operates and monitors Australian gaming machines, would be no
easy feat for Tabcorp.

Fetching a price around the $500m for the unit in isolation would be
challenging, hence the reason for a bid of under $3.5bn for the two
units collectively.

The wagering and gaming division have the same technical resources and
share the same services team.

Tabcorp, advised by UBS, is handing down its half year profit result on
Wednesday and in an environment where bidders are doing battle for parts
of the business, it is expected to be closely watched, with some
anticipating the announcement of a demerger.

This follows approaches for the wagering and media unit from at least
three buyers.

As well as Entain, advised by Morgan Stanley and Macquarie Capital, and
Apollo, a third party, Matthew Tripp, had approached the board in
January with a proposal to buy the division with private equity backing.

But the understanding is that it came at an opportunistic price with
uncertainty surrounding funding.

Mr Tripp was known to be an interested bidder last year, as first
flagged by The Australian.

While Entain is seen as having solid credentials to run the Tabcorp unit
and that a deal would create strong synergies for the global gaming
giant, a plan to buy the wagering arm may face opposition from the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

A purchase by any party would also need the blessing of the Australian
racing industry.

But Apollo is also no stranger to the betting industry.

The company in December purchased Italian sports betting and digital
gaming business Lottomatica and made efforts to purchase William Hill's
European unit late last year after the company was sold to bookmaker
Caesars Entertainment.

The private equity firm has a track record of buying only stakes of
companies.

In Australia during 2014, it purchased a 50 per cent interest in the
services unit of Leighton Holdings (now CIMIC) in a deal that valued the
unit at $1bn.

Later, Apollo explored a deal to buy CIMIC's mining services operation
Thiess before later walking away.

Some Tabcorp shareholders are believed to be eager for the company to
announce a demerger of the wagering arm to extract greater value from
its lotteries division.

But some market participants say such a move would not come without
risks, with questions surrounding the company's earnings outlook on the
back of u per centoming negotiations with Victoria Racing to retain the
wagering and betting licence and the winding down of the Job Keeper
government subsidies creating industry uncertainty.

Some also say it is worth remembering that in 2019, suitors for
Graincorp's malt division retreated from the target once the unit was
spun off from the country's largest grain handler.

2.59pm: Shares sink as Iron Bridge fallout brings Fortescue leadership
changes

Fortescue Metals COO Greg Lileyman has resigned with immediate effect
after a review of the Iron Bridge project.

Don Hyma, Director Projects, and Manie McDonald, Director Iron Bridge
have also resigned.

Derek Bown, General Manager Solomon, has been named Acting Director
Projects.

"At Fortescue, our commitment to our values and culture is our highest
priority," Fortescue CEO, Elizabeth Gaines says in a statement to the
ASX.

"What we've learned through our review of the Iron Bridge project to
date, is that we have lost sight of that critical focus.

"Since Fortescue was established, our values, above all else, have
driven our behaviours and our decisions.

Today, it is that culture and our values which have come to the fore as
we announce these difficult changes."

Ms Gaines says she will forgo all incentive payments for this financial
year.

"As CEO I must also take accountability and learn from this". she says.

The detailed review underway for the Iron Bridge Magnetite project is
continuing and an update is expected to be provided with the release of
Fortescue's half year financial results on 18 February 2021.

Shares dived from $24.58 to 8-day low of $23.22 after the announcement,
last down 5per cent at $23.22.

2.47pm: Ingenia lifts profit to $32.8m as holidays pick up

Holiday and retirement park company Ingenia Communities Group has
unveiled an underlying profit of $32.8m for the first half, a 24 per
cent jump on last year.

The company's net profit was up 38 per cent to $32.5m as performance was
driven by more people taking more local holidays and 128 new home
settlements in the half.

Underlying earnings per share fell 6 per cent to 10.1 cents partly in
the wake of the group's equity raisings and it declared a first half
distribution of 5c per share.

Ingenia chief executive Simon Owen said the strong profit result showed
how well the group had positioned itself to benefit from the opening up
of key markets and the overall relaxing of COVID-19 restrictions.

"The core residential rental business demonstrated resilience, with no
interruption to rent collection," he said. Mr Owen cited record
occupancy across Ingenia Gardens and a growing rental base across the
group's lifestyle business, which bolstered the group's stable cash
flows.

Ingenia's holidays business has strong demand and forward bookings are
up 22 per cent for the remainder of this financial year, providing a
positive outlook for holiday parks in NSW, Queensland and Victoria.

"Our holidays business is benefiting from a buoyant outlook for domestic
travel and we are seeing increased activity in our development projects
as we reactivate new projects and larger sales events," Mr Owen said.

Ingenia cautioned that COVID-19 was being felt across a number of assets
and in lower settlement volumes as the impact of reduced sales in the
first half washed through the pipeline.

The group expects to deliver growth in earnings before interest and tax
of 15-20 per cent this financial year but because of share issues
underlying earnings per security is expected to decline by 1- 2 cents
per security.

Ingenia shares lost 6c to $5.33.

Ingenia recognised a JobKeeper subsidy of $5.1m in the half year result
but due to the pick up of holiday parks coastal areas will return $1.7m
of the payments to the government.

2.45pm: BHP's nagging $10bn potash headache

When Ken MacKenzie convenes the BHP board mid-year, a key decision will
be whether to proceed with an asset on which the company has already
spent $US4.2 billion, with another $US6 billion in costs on the way if
it goes ahead.

That will be $US10 billion spent over 15 years before the company earns
its first cent from the project.

The Jansen potash mine in Saskatchewan Canada has not been one of BHP's
finest projects, coming as it did after the company misread the politics
of its $US40 billion bid for neighbouring Potash Corp.

The latter has since merged with Agrium to form Nutrien which is a key
producer in an oversupplied market.

BHP CEO Mike Henry talks up the prospects for the project but the sunk
capital costs alone make it a tough decision for MacKenzie and his
board.

If the company had its time again it would have either pressed the start
button some time ago or simply walked away. To spend so much without
earning a cent is not the way BHP likes to do business.

2.38pm: Big energy backs review of ACCC's LNG netback method

Big energy users have backed a review of the ACCC's LNG netback
methodology as they push for the introduction of a new pricing mechanism
to ease the cost of domestic gas on Australia's east coast.

Frustration over gas prices has grown after a deal between Scott
Morrison and big LNG exporters in January avoided formal price controls,
which some big manufacturers had pushed for but were strenuously
resisted by the LNG industry.

The ACCC has announced a review of the pricing benchmark, providing
ammunition for industrial users as they push for a change in the
benchmark method for east coast prices to be included in a code of
conduct for the gas industry due by the end of February.

"The ACCC's current netback methodology only excludes recovery of
short-term export-related costs, and domestic gas users fear this leaves
them exposed to the longer-term costs of LNG export infrastructure they
don't use or benefit from," a joint statement by major gas users' said.

"Our own immediate focus is the joint work of our organisations on
behalf of gas users to negotiate with gas suppliers on a Code of Conduct
that we all hope will make a positive contribution and improve outcomes
for domestic gas users."

Manufacturers say they can't find gas on a contracted basis for less
than $8 to $10 a gigajoule, more than double historic levels.

They want changes to the competition regulator's LNG netback formula -
effectively the price of LNG shipped overseas less processing and
shipping costs. Instead, they have called for the removal of an implicit
cost premium built in to pay back the cost of the giant LNG export
plants used to ship gas to Asian buyers saying the cost of LNG capital
accounts for $2 to $3 a gigajoule in the final price that domestic users
pay for gas.

The gas users collective comprises lobby organisations the Ai Group,
Chemistry Australia, Manufacturing Australia and Energy Users
Association of Australia.

2.17pm: Hubspot passes 100,000 paying customers

Marketing and sales software start-up Hubspot has just passed 100,000
paying customers and $1bn in annual recurring revenue, and its
co-founder and CEO Brian Halligan says the company's 15-year journey has
been a story of 'one step backward, two steps forward'.

Speaking to The Australian to mark the dual milestones, Halligan says
Hubspot's path to Wall Street success has been anything but easy. The
failure rate for start-ups is about 90 per cent, and the executive says
in the early days "we didn't have any money, we didn't have any
customers and we didn't know what the heck we were doing."

"I would say it's been tough all the way," Halligan says.

"It's been a constant evolution but we're also constantly evaluating
where we are at. For other start-ups, I'd say look at yourself in the
mirror and ask really tough questions. And don't be afraid to take that
step back so you can take two steps forward. That's sort of how I think
about the journey.

"The more we take those steps back and really reflect on what we're
doing, the faster we grow it seems. And we haven't been shy about doing
that. We made lots of decisions along the way that were a little
counterintuitive that probably slowed growth down a lot in the short
term but really enabled us to speed up a lot in the long term."

1.58pm: Zip Co speeding ticket as US listing rumours swirl

Buy now pay later provider Zip Co has responded to a "speeding ticket"
issued by the ASX after its shares jumped 22 per cent since Monday on
rumours the company is considering a US listing.

In a letter to the ASX, Zip Co claimed it was not aware of any
unreleased information that could account for the recent share price
increase, attributing it to general market interest in the BNPL sector
and recent company events.

"The company notes that there has been significant interest in the Buy
Now Pay Later ("BNPL") market generally," it said.

"Furthermore, specific to Zip, the company has recently advised the
market of the following positive events: Successful placement in late
2020 and oversubscribed share purchase plan in early 2021...and...A
trading update for Q2FY21 announced on 21 January 2021, which confirmed
extremely strong quarterly trading results year on year."

Zip Co will hand down its half year results on Thursday February 25.

It is currently trading at around $13.50 a share, up from $11.06 on
Monday morning.

1.38pm: Collins Foods to return Sizzler JobKeeper

Fast food chain owner Collins Foods is the latest retailer to return
JobKeeper payments to the federal government and follows from businesses
such as Domino's, Nick Scali and Adairs that have sent back the wage
subsidies after booking solid lifts in profits for the December half.

Collins Foods, which is a key owner of KFC restaurants in Australia as
well as Taco Bell and Sizzler, said it will be returning JobKeeper
payments of $1.8m received during fiscal 2021 for Sizzler Australia
operations.

Collins Foods received that amount in JobKeeper subsidies from the
Australian government following a decline of more than 30 per cent in
revenue in its Sizzler Australia division's nine remaining restaurants
early in the pandemic - the threshold for access to the federal
government's stimulus program designed to keep people in jobs.

Of the three restaurant brands that Collins Foods operates, Sizzler was
hardest hit during the COVID-19 pandemic and the company decided to
close down the Sizzler brand.

Even though Sizzler employees would continue to be entitled to JobKeeper
until their restaurant closures, Collins Foods decided from the date of
the closure decision that it would not continue to seek the JobKeeper
allowance from the Australian federal government. Instead, it topped up
payments to the equivalent JobKeeper payment they would have received as
part of the government program.

Collins Foods' chief executive Drew O'Malley said: "With the onset of
the pandemic many activities that we all hold dear, like eating together
in restaurants, faced an uncertain future.

"We claimed JobKeeper payments for our Sizzler business in the spirit of
the program's intent, which was to help support the job security of our
600 dedicated Sizzler employees during a time where sales were down well
over 50 per cent."

1.33pm: Breville shares slump after dividend cut

Home appliances group Breville has surprised its investors by holding
back some of the cash flooding its coffers from a surge in consumer
spending during the pandemic.

It has decided to slash its dividend by a third, as it directs its
accelerating earnings to new growth opportunities.

This could pay off in the longer term, as Breville upped its earnings
guidance for fiscal 2021.

But the market doesn't like surprises and shares in Breville slumped 5
per cent to $29 on the slimmer dividend payout.

Breville, whose biggest shareholder is Solomon Lew's family and his
Premier Investments company, which have a combined stake of 32 per cent,
hit a milestone in calendar year 2020 as it cracked $1.1bn in sales for
the first time, accelerating earnings growth.

Investors will in the short term miss out on the boom when it comes to
dividends.

1.24pm: Consumer sentiment eases after snap lockdowns

Consumer sentiment, as measured by Roy Morgan and ANZ, eased by 2 per
cent in the first half of February due to virus concerns, notes CommSec
senior economist Ryan Felsman.

"Sentiment had hit 15-month highs at the end of January, but snap
Covid-19 lockdowns in both Victoria and Western Australia have dampened
consumer spirits.

'Border closures have disrupted late-summer holiday plans and affected
business supply chains. ANZ economists reported that consumer sentiment
in Melbourne slid by 5.4 per cent last week after Melburnians entered
their third lockdown at 11.59pm on Friday 12 February.

"While Commonwealth Bank (CBA) household credit and debit card spending
is likely to fall sharply in Victoria this week, observed historical
data shows that spending tends to bounce-back quickly once government
restrictions are lifted," says Felsman.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said yesterday that the state was "well
placed" to lift restrictions at 11.59pm tomorrow evening due to low
Covid-19 case numbers over the first few days of the lockdown.

1.09pm: Victoria lags in national jobs recovery

Victoria continues to lag the national jobs recovery, with payroll
figures showing 1.7 per cent fewer Victorian employees in the final week
of January versus a year earlier.

As Melbournites suffer through another lockdown, the new figures from
the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the number of payroll
jobs had followed a seasonal pattern to lift across all jurisdictions
and industries in the back half of January.

Nationally, the data showed there was a 1.3 per cent lift in employees
registered in the ATO's single-touch payroll system between the weeks
ending January 16 and 30, leaving the same number of employees
nationally as there were a year before.

ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said "payroll jobs continued
to follow a seasonal pattern, increasing through January", with all
jurisdictions and industries recording gains.

The latest data provide further evidence that the post-COVID labour
market recovery extended into 2021, despite a summer of brief lockdowns
and border closures.

Official labour force statistics due on Thursday are expected to show a
30,000 lift in employment in January, and a drop in the jobless rate
from 6.6 per cent to 6.5 per cent, based on consensus economist
forecasts.

Last week the Department of Social Services reported around 100,000
fewer JobSeeker recipients last month, although the number of
Australians on welfare remains well above pre-pandemic levels. Consumer
confidence is at around 10-year highs, buoying hopes that households
will continue to spend beyond the end of major income support measures
in late March.

In the two other big east coast states, the ABS data showed a similar
picture of a payroll jobs recovery that is largely complete: NSW weekly
payrolls were 0.1 per cent down versus 12 months ago, while Queensland
was 0.2 per cent higher.

The ABS figures also showed there were 3.5 per cent more payroll jobs in
Northern Territory than a year prior, and around 2.5 per cent more in
Western Australia and South Australia. In contrast, Tasmanian weekly
payroll jobs were tracking 1.7 per cent below 2020 levels.

The scars on some industries, however, remain deep.

There were more than 10 per cent fewer patrolled employees in hard-hit
segments such as accommodation and food services and education and
training than there were in March, the ABS data showed.

1.02pm: Sole operators boom as business start-ups rise: ABS

Australia added 46,651 additional businesses across the country in 2020,
despite a crippling pandemic and lockdowns that smashed high streets and
shopping centres across the country.

The latest data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
shows 344,472 new businesses entered the economy in 2020.

That compares with 297,821 businesses that failed and exited the economy
in the same year.

It's an overall 2 per cent growth in the number of businesses in the
economy, but a slight decline from a peak in 2018-2019, where 355,722
new businesses were added.

Solo operations were on the rise, growing 3.5 per cent in the ABS
figures, to a total of 687,571 for the year.

Sole proprietors experienced an entry rate of 21 per cent, potentially
reflecting the rise of the gig economy. Business partnerships dropped by
3.3 per cent.

Medium-sized businesses employing between 20 and 199 people shrank 12.3
per cent and businesses employing more than 200 people declined 5.3 per
cent, shedding 231 operators.

The biggest growth areas were transport, postal and warehousing;
professional, scientific and technical services; and healthcare and
social assistance.

Those three industries accounted for more than half the net increase in
new businesses for the year.

Agriculture, forestry, and fishing was the worst affected industry
category across the economy, down 1 per cent for the year.

This was followed by manufacturing, mining, and information media and
telecommunications.

Tasmania was the best performing state, where total businesses grew 3.8
per cent.

The state's economy added an additional 1500 operators.

Victoria grew 3 per cent while Western Australia added just 0.5 per
cent.

12.58pm: Former CUB boss Ari Mervis joins McPherson's board

Consumer health and wellness products supplier McPherson's has appointed
the former boss of Carlton & United Breweries and Murray Goulburn, Ari
Mervis, as an independent, non-executive director, effective
immediately.

Mr Mervis has extensive global experience which spans a range of
industries in branded goods, consumer staples, agriculture, food and
beverages.

His recent executive roles have been executive chairman of Accolade
Wines, MD and CEO of Murray Goulburn, and prior to that he spent 27
years at global brewer SABMiller where his career culminated as CEO of
Carlton & United Breweries and MD Asia Pacific - a member of the global
leadership team.

He was also chairman of SAB India and SAB Vietnam and he motivated and
completed the $US10.2bn acquisition of Foster's (CUB) by SABMiller.

12.35pm: Super funds positive, up +3 per cent: Chant West

Super funds have kept up the positive momentum in the first few weeks of
the year, returning close to 3 per cent by mid-February, according to
research house Chant West.

While the median growth fund was up just 0.2 per cent in January,
February has been more positive, with an estimated 2.5 per cent gain to
date, Chant West senior investment research manager Mano Mohankumar
said.

The median growth super fund has now returned more than 18 per cent
since March last year, after the solid gains following the 2020 market
crash were boosted by further positive returns in the first few weeks of
2021.

"In January, emerging markets outperformed developed markets despite a
sell-off late in the month on concerns around a resurgence in COVID-19
cases.

"The US share market experienced increased volatility as a result of
highly unusual and targeted trading by a segment of retail investors.
This overshadowed the underlying investor optimism brought about by
President Biden's proposed stimulus plan," he said.

Australian shares were up 0.3 per cent over January but this was offset
by the weaker performance in international shares, which returned -0.2
per cent and 0.1 per cent in hedged and unhedged terms, respectively.

12.05pm: ASX +0.5%; banks, resources strong

Australia's sharemarket continues to benefit from buoyant offshore
markets and strong earnings reports.

The S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.5 per cent at 6901.8 at midday, on track for
its highest daily close in almost 12-months.

The index hit an early high of 6913.7, which was its highest point since
25 February 2020.

While the US market was closed on Monday, S&P 500 futures were up 0.5
per cent in APAC trading.

That follows a strong night in UK and European markets amid growing
optimism about Covid vaccines.

Australian earnings reports added to the optimism with BHP up 2.3 per
cent on a strong dividend payment.

Rio Tinto and Fortescue are tracking BHP with gains of 3.4 per cent and
1.7 per cent before their reports this week.

Banks were higher, but trimmed early gains with NAB up 0.7 per cent
after its trading update showed a big fall in bad debt provisions and
better margins.

Zip Co surged 12 per cent amid short covering amid talk that a US
listing might follow its roadshow last week.

Treasury Wine fell 6.2 per cent, while GWA Group lost 5.9 per cent and
Domain lost 4.3 per cent after their results.

CBA, Magellan, Computershare and IAG shares fell after trading
ex-dividend.

12.00pm: Seven West content deal could reap $39m-$69m annually: JPM

Seven West Media could receive between $39.5m-$69.2m annually from its
freshly-inked content deal with Google for the tech giant's Showcase
product, according to JPMorgan, based on its analysis of Google's
Showcase showdown in France.

"Reminiscent of Bob Barker's 'Showcase Showdown', both SWM and NEC have
been given a chance to spin Google's Showcase wheel, and SMW is happy
with the first spin - signing a contract to get paid for content
appearing within the platform (NEC much less-so)," JPMorgan says in
research note.

JP Morgan says Showcase, which was launched in Australia earlier this
month, pays publishers for content appearing within the Showcase
platform but not stories that appear in search results.

"This comes at an opportune time with the media bargaining code
legislation," JPMorgan says.

Seven announced the Google deal on Monday and also reported solid 1H
results, including a big drop in costs and net debt.

Due to lower costs, JPMorgan lifts its FY21 Ebitda forecast to $293.5m
from $213.4m. It has also upped its FY22 Ebitda forecast to $258m from
$202m.

Broker retains overweight rating on Seven and 55c price target.

Seven shares up 16 per cent, or 8c, to 58c, while shares in Nine
Entertainment gain 2.9 per cent, or 8c, at $2.82.

11.43am: Premature to consider withdrawing monetary stimulus: RBA

The RBA is monitoring the effects of easy monetary policy on the economy
but there are few signs of a deterioration in lending standards at this
point.

In a discussion on the effect that low interest rates have on financial
and macroeconomic stability, the RBA board acknowledged the risks
inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate
environment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices,
particularly in the housing market.

However it concluded that there were "greater benefits for financial
stability from a stronger economy, while acknowledging the importance of
closely monitoring risks in asset markets", according to the minutes of
its February board meeting, at which it announced an extension of its
quantitative easing program.

"Members concluded that very significant monetary support would be
required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's
goals for inflation and unemployment were achieved," the minutes said.

"Given this, it would be premature to consider withdrawing monetary
stimulus."

The minutes also said the QE program had helped to lower interest rates
and had "contributed to a lower exchange rate than otherwise."

11.38am: Aussie wheat crop set to surge to record 33.34m tonnes

ABARES raised its estimate of national production of winter crops by 7.4
per cent to 55.2 million tonnes in 2020-21, notes CommSec.

"Australia's wheat crop is expected to surge by a whopping 119.8 per
cent to a record 33.34 million tonnes over the period. Chicago wheat
futures prices are around the highest level since 2014 at US$636.75 a
bushel as Russia curbs exports to protect domestic supplies and cold
weather threatens crops in the Northern Hemisphere.

"Agricultural economists are also forecasting that Aussie barley
production could increase by 45.5 per cent to 13.09 million tonnes in
2020-21 with canola output up by 73.9 per cent to 4.05 million tonnes."

Widespread rainfall and improving growing conditions in Australia's
wheat belt are boosting farm exports to grain-hungry China, says Ryan
Felsman, senior economist at CommSec.

"Aussie rural exports surged 18.4 per cent in December - the most in 25
years - on the back of a massive 75 per cent lift in the value of cereal
exports to $1.15bn. And the lift in export income is set to continue."

11.31am: More than half NZ population watches Netflix

Roy Morgan CEO Michele Levine says the new competition in the New
Zealand subscription TV market over the past year with the entry of
Disney+ means consumers have been the big winners with a wider variety
of content available to view:

"Over 2.8 million New Zealanders (68% of the population) now watch
Subscription TV in an average four weeks. Although growth has slowed in
the overall market with an increase of only 4.9% viewers from a year ago
there has been faster growth for the newer services in the market.

"Disney+ has been the stand-out performer during 2020 with the service
which was launched in the final months of 2019 already attracting
700,000 viewers within a year of launching and becoming the third most
watched Subscription TV service already.

"Amazon Prime Video has been in the market since late 2016 but really
experienced strong growth during 2020 and increased its viewership by
141,000 to 323,000, an increase of 77.5% on a year ago.

"However, despite the fast growth for both Disney+ and Amazon Prime
Video, the clear market leader is again Netflix which is viewed by over
2.1 million New Zealanders in an average four weeks - more than half of
the population.

"Also in a strong position in the market is Sky which includes under its
banner Sky TV, the Sky Sport Now sports streaming service (formerly FAN
PASS) and the Neon streaming service. During mid-2020 Sky purchased the
Lightbox streaming service and merged this into Neon in June 2020.
Across these different services Sky now attracts an audience of
1,248,000 viewers - around one-in-three New Zealanders."

11.16am: Could BHP pay out even more next time?

BHP is likely to unveil an even larger payout for shareholders come its
FY2021 result in August, as long as commodity prices remain robust,
Jefferies reckons.

It is worth noting BHP has already used almost all of its calendar year
2020 free cash flow for dividends, Jefferies says.

BHP is paying a record interim dividend of $US1.01/share.

Still, "the strong balance sheet could have justified an even larger
capital return", says Jefferies.

Net debt is below BHP's target range and the miner is expected to
benefit from strong prices for commodities such as iron ore.

11.08am: Nearmap target raised to $3.10: Canaccord

Canaccord's Owen Humphries raised his Nearmap target price 7 per cent to
$3.10 while reiterating his Buy rating after NEA's interim report
yesterday.

That puts him almost in line with Bloomberg's consensus target price of
$3.14. The consensus is bullish with 8 of 9 analysts holding a Buy or
equivalent rating.

Mr Humphries says Nearmap's business is performing better than
previously expected with upside risk to constant currency annualised
contract volume guidance if new customer sales improve in line with an
improved economic environment.

"While there is likely to be short-term ACV/earnings downgrades relating
to currency movements and an accelerated investment program, we believe
the company has the opportunity to become a global leader in the large
aerial imagery and location intelligence market," he says.

He notes that the company appears to be gearing for a strong FY22 that
will likely herald accelerating ACV growth with an improved unit
economics (sales contribution ratio) and positive incremental data
points that will likely be viewed positively by the market.

"In our view, NEA remains a stock investors should hold over the long
term given our view of its long-tailed growth opportunity - globally
applicable technology and unique subscription business model," he
argues.

"If NEA executes to plan and returns the business to its targeted 20-40
per cent increase in top-line growth, we believe the stock would trade
on an enterprise value to annualised contract volume of 6 times in FY23,
which remains well below its global enterprise software peers (averaging
11.1 times)."

Nearmap shares have risen 4 per cent to a 3-month high of $2.68 this
morning despite an update by J Capital on last week's short sell
recommendation.

10.42am: 'Australians should be outraged' by gas price discrepancies

Big gas users say the ACCC's latest findings confirm some domestic
customers are still paying more for supplies than international buyers
of Australia's gas.

Energy Minister Angus Taylor said he was concerned with findings in the
report that "Australian gas users are not always receiving
internationally competitive prices".

Industry group Manufacturing Australia said the competition regulator's
report confirmed buyers' fears that reforms are needed for the market.

"This is the tenth consecutive ACCC report that finds gas companies are
charging Australian customers higher than export parity prices. Every
Australian should be outraged by that," Manufacturing Australia chief
executive Ben Eade said.

"It should also put paid to the recent, absurd, claims by gas producers
that they are being asked to "subsidise" their customers. If anything,
the ACCC reports highlight that Australian customers have been
subsidising gas companies' export investments for most of the past
decade. That's not sustainable."

"Customers will continue to seek a fairer, more liquid, more transparent
and more competitive gas market in Australia, as is being advocated by
the ACCC," Mr Eade said.

10.41am: JCap sends new short salvo at Nearmap

Beijing-based activist short seller J Capital has fired a fresh salvo at
Nearmap, declaring the aerial map maker is avoiding answering key
questions about its US business.

Nearmap was the ASX's best performing stock on Monday, after it
responded to a report from J Capital that alleged its US business was
severely underperforming, and that its technology advantage had been
eroded by competitor Eagleview. The attack last week sent Nearmap's
shares down by 10 per cent in one hour, but on Monday it was up by 19
per cent, sending short sellers underwater.

"Nearmap did not dispute that the Eagleview camera system is twice as
efficient," J Capital said in a fresh report Tuesday. "No attempt was
made to demonstrate market-share improvement in the US. Then company
obfuscated pricing strategy with obtuse language that does not refute
any of our statements.

"We continue to believe that Nearmap cannot compete in North America. We
now also believe that the company is losing share in Australia and New
Zealand."

NEA turned up 2.7 per cent to a fresh 3-month high at $2.64 after
falling 2 per cent in early trade.

10.28am: ASX rises 0.7 per cent to 12-month high

Australia's sharemarket surged to its highest level in almost 12-months
after strong gains in Europe and positive earnings reports domestically.

The S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.7 per cent to 6913.7 points in opening trading,
breaking last week's high of 6901 to reach its highest point since Feb
25th 2020.

BHP rose 2.5 per cent on a strong dividend payment and NAB gained 2.3
per cent as a massive fall in impaired loan charges offset a weaker net
interest margin in its 1Q trading update.

Those reports flowed through to the other iron ore miners and banks,
respectively, with Rio Tinto up 3.1 per cent and Westpac up 2.1 per
cent, while CBA fell 0.7 per cent ex-dividend.

Virgin Money, Zip Co and Bendigo Bank jostled for best performing ASX200
stock with Bendigo up 5 per cent after broker upgrades following a
strong report on Monday.

But the S&P/ASX 200 has trimmed its gain with CSL down 0.6 per cent,
Wesfarmers down 1.1 per cent and Treasury Wine down 8.5 per cent

A daily close above 68882.6 would make it the best in almost 12 months.

S&P/ASX 200 last up 0.3 per cent at 6888.

10.11am: Strong upgrade momentum for BHP: Macquarie

Macquarie Equities analyst Hayden Bairstow sees a continuation of strong
upgrade momentum for BHP after its interim results.

He says the 1H21 results itself was "mixed" with in-line EBIDTA and cash
flow and weaker earnings offset by a higher interim dividend.

Currency headwinds put pressure on costs with capex guidance increased
slightly.

But buoyant iron-ore prices are underpinning "strong upgrade momentum"
for BHP.

Mr Bairstow estimates that a spot price scenario generates about 30 per
cent and 90 per cent higher earnings than his forecasts for FY21 and
FY22, respectively.

And BHP's free cash flow yields at spot prices are 18-20 per cent for
FY22-FY23.

BHP shares rose 2.5 per cent to a 3-week high of $46.90 in early
trading.

Last up 1.9 per cent at $46.63.

10.07am: Tin surges nearly 17 per cent on LME: CBA

Spot tin prices surged nearly 17% on the LME yesterday, notes
Commonwealth Bank's Global Markets Research team.

"Spot prices are still about 12% lower than record-highs reached in
April 2011. Prices have increased this year on the back of declining
stockpiles and strong industrial demand particularly for semi-conductors
and electronics," the team said.

"Supply is simply struggling to keep up with demand. The metal usually
attracts less attention than its base metal peers because of its low
liquidity. However, investor interest is growing, particularly in
China's Shanghai Futures Exchange."

10.01am: Morningstar raises Seven West Media estimates

Morningstar has increased its FY21 and FY22 Ebit estimates on Seven West
Media by an average of 80 per cent following the media group's 1H
results.

The Kerry Stokes-controlled group reported on Monday that it had
returned to a statutory net profit of $116.4m in 1H21 from a net loss of
$49.4m and cut its net debt by $68m to $329m.

"The better than expected progress in balance sheet repair has vaporised
our key concern regarding the group's financial position," media analyst
Brian Han says in a research note.

Han also removes his previous 50 per cent probability assumption of zero
value in Seven's equity and reverts his fair value estimate to an
intrinsic basis.

"Our fair value uncertainty rating has been cut to high, from extreme,"
he said.

Morningstar's standalone fair value estimate has been raised to 43c a
share from 20c, "mainly reflecting the stellar cost-out efforts''.

Operating expenses fell 18 per cent in 1H from a year ago and are on
track to be 9 per cent lower for the 2021 financial year.

"Seven's cost structure has been right-sized just in time to enjoy the
operating leverage from a likely improvement in its free-to-air TV
advertising revenue share from the current June-half," Han says. He
forecasts 38.2 per cent in FY21 from 37.4 per cent in FY20.

"The swifter-than-expected ratings turnaround vindicates management's
content

strategy refresh, to one focused on externally sourced tentpole
franchises," Han says.

9.50am: 4WD, outdoor love drives ARB profit rise

4WD accessories retailer and manufacturer ARB Corporation has more than
doubled its profit for the first half of the financial year and boosted
its dividend after "pent-up" demand for outdoor recreation attributable
to the COVID-19 lockdowns translated to higher sales.

The company's net profit after tax was $54m, up 113.5 per cent on the
$25.29m achieved during the previous comparable period.

Sales revenue increased 21.6 per cent to $283.9m while a fully franked
interim dividend of 29c a share was declared, up 56.8 per cent on last
year's interim distribution.

The company said gross margin was helped by cost containment,
efficiencies and an improved Australian dollar against the Thai baht.

A JobKeeper subsidy of $9.8m was also received during the period.

ARB Corporation said it had a positive "short-term" outlook based on its
customer order book but did not give specific full-year guidance due to
the continuing uncertainty of the pandemic.

9.45am: Dividend to rally BHP shares: RBC

BHP's stronger-than-expected dividend should drive "more positivity" on
BHP shares, according to RBC's Pekar Kaan, who reiterates his Outperform
rating at $55 target price after today's results.

He says it was a "fairly plain vanilla report from BHP at first glance"
since most one-offs were pre-reported, with EBITDA of $US14.7bn near the
$US14.8bn consensus and EPS a fractional miss at $US1.194 vs $US1.21
expected.

However, cash generation was better than expected with net debt at
$11.8bn vs $12.3bn expected.

"This opened the door for BHP to pay out a record half year dividend,"
Mr Kaan says.

He notes that BHP's $US1.01 per share interim dividend beat the $US0.81
consensus despite recent upgrades.

He feels the 85 per cent payout ratio, roughly equivalent to the free
cash flow generated in the period and translating to a 10 per cent free
cash flow yield "will serve to drive even further income-based
rerating."

And a strong overall cost performance will reassure investors in his
view.

BHP closed Monday at $45.75.

9.30am: Spending improvements widespread in Jan: CBA

Appetite for property ticked higher in January 2021, with combined CBA
and Google data showing an increase in home buying intentions, as well
as higher spending intentions in travel and health and fitness.

The Commonwealth Bank Household Spending Intentions (HSI) series signals
a January 2021 pick-up in prospective spending on residential property,
travel and health & fitness among Australian households.

CBA chief economist Stephen Halmarick said the data showed widespread
improvement in spending intentions despite some Covid-related lockdowns
in pockets of the country at the start of the year.

"Our view remains that the Australian economic recovery from the
Covid-19 recession is well underway," Mr Halmarick said, adding that CBA
forecasts the economy to grow 4.2% in 2021, while the unemployment rate
is expected to fall to 5.7% by year-end.

9.26am: NAB soured loans plunge as cash earnings rise

A sharp fall in loan impairments has enabled National Australia Bank to
report cash earnings of $1.65bn for the December quarter, up 47 per cent
on the quarterly average in the second half of 2020.

The value of soured loans plunged to only $15m, down 98 per cent from
the previous quarterly average.

This reflected top-ups and forward-looking adjustments in the second
half which did not recur in the latest quarter.

Chief executive Ross McEwan said NAB's underlying performance had been
sound in a competitive, low-interest rate environment.

"Improving economic and health outcomes in Australia and New Zealand are
encouraging, as are the reductions we are seeing in deferral balances,"
Mr McEwan said.

"However, there are still a number of uncertainties requiring further
clarity.

At an operating level, cash earnings before tax and impairment charges
fell 5 per cent compared to the quarterly average, with revenue
declining 3 per cent after lower treasury and markets income due to the
non-repeat of mark-to-market loss reversals.

The net interest margin declined but was stable excluding the impact of
treasury and markets and higher liquids.

Competition and the impact of low interest rates were offset by
home-loan repricing and lower funding and deposit costs.

9.18am: Crown formally 'unsuitable' for Sydney gaming licence

The NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority has formally served
Crown Resorts with a letter confirming the company's unsuitability to
operate its Barangaroo Casino under its restricted gaming licence.

Although ILGA confirmed Crown's unsuitability last Tuesday when the
Bergin report into the company was tabled in parliament, the
stipulations of the restricted gaming licence mean the two parties must
now enter into a formal process of negotiation.

ILGA chair Philip Crawford has previously indicated he believes Crown
chair Helen Coonan can make the necessary changes to restore the
company's suitability before the year ends.

9.12am: Cost cutting, JobKeeper boost Domain; listings growing

Real estate classifieds website Domain has boosted its half year profit
by more than 50 per cent after managing to drive down expenses through
cost discipline and use of the government's JobKeeper scheme.

The company recorded a net profit of $19.4m, up 52.2 per cent on the
prior comparable period, despite revenue declining by 3.8 per cent to
$137m.

Expenses declined 14.5 per cent due to a "a multi-year strategy to drive
cost discipline" and the receival of $8.3m in JobKeeper wage subsidies.

Despite booking a profit, Domain said it would defer consideration of a
dividend payment until the end of the financial year.

The company said it anticipated a strong second half of the year, with
listings growth particularly noticeable in Melbourne over January but
said the absence of the government's JobKeeper scheme will increase
costs in the "mid to high" single digit range over 2020.

9.10am: Sims turns a profit; raises dividend

Scrap-metal merchant Sims reported a first-half profit, versus a loss
the same time a year ago, as it benefited from higher metal prices and
recent cost cutting.

The company recorded a net profit of $53.0 million for the six months
through December. That compared to a net loss of $91.1 million in the
same period the year prior.

The company raised its interim dividend to 12.0c a share, from last
year's half-year payout of 6.0 cents a share. Sims didn't pay a final
dividend for last fiscal year, ended June 30, 2020, as it grappled with
market volatility because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Dow Jones Newswires

9.07am: ASX may hit 11-month high

Australia's sharemarket may hit an 11-month high amid buoyant global
markets.

Overnight futures relative to fair value suggest the S&P/ASX 200 index
will open about 0.2 per cent near 6883.

A daily close above 6880.68 would be the highest daily close in almost
12 months. The equivalent level on an intraday basis is 6901 points.

CBA, CPU, IAG, JHG, MFG and MIN trade ex-dividend today.

While the US market was closed for Presidents' Day, UK and European
markets rose strongly with the FTSE 100 up 2.5 per cent and the Euro
Stoxx 50 up 1 per cent.

Apart from RBA minutes and weekly payrolls data at 1130am today there
are 11 ASX 200 companies including BHP and Brambles reporting and NAB's
quarterly trading update out.

BHP's underlying 1H net profit of $US6.04bn missed Bloomberg's consensus
estimate of $US6.39bn by almost 6 per cent but the dividend beat
estimates by 20 per cent with BHP paying $US1.01/share versus
$US0.84/share.

WTI crude oil futures rose 1.1 per cent to a 13-month high close of
$US60.12 a barrel as an "arctic freeze" in Texas cut Permian Basin crude
oil production down 1 million barrels a day.

China and Taiwan remain closed for Lunar New Year holidays.

The S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.9 per cent to 6868.9 on Monday.

8.37am: Adairs almost doubles interim dividend on strong sales

Home furnishings retailer Adairs has ridden the wave of people spending
more money in their homes through extended lockdowns and the Covid-19
pandemic, with sales for the December half up 34.8 per cent to $243m and
net profit up by 233.4 per cent to $43.9m.

It almost doubled its interim dividend.

The retailer delivered record sales and profitability at a time when its
43 greater Melbourne Adairs stores were closed for almost half the
period due to Covid-19 related restrictions. Sales and underlying EBIT
exceeded the December 2020 guidance after adjusting for the $6.1 million
repayment of the JobKeeper wage subsidy benefit.

Adairs declared an interim dividend of 13 cents per share, up from 7
cents per share in 2020, and payable on April 16.

Chief executive Mark Ronan said: "The first half of fiscal 2020 was
significant for Adairs with record levels of sales and profitability,
the acquisition of Mocka and the finalisation of our domestic supply
chain strategy. We continued to deliver above market sales growth with
group like for like sales up 6.9 per cent and online sales up 31.6 per
cent (excluding Mocka)."

It said in the first seven weeks of the second half Adairs generated
like for like sales growth of 2.3 per cent and like for like gross
profit growth of 8.5 per cent.

Adairs is forecasting full-year 2020 EBIT of $48m to $52m.

8.37am: Redbubble profit rockets; investment next step

Online clothes and apparel marketplace Redbubble has booked a gross
profit of $144m for the half year, up 118 per cent on the prior
comparable period.

The company also swung into positive EBIT profit territory of $42m,
compared to a $2m loss last financial year.

The company said it had seen strong customer demand into the peak
holiday season across all geographies and categories, even as demand for
reusable masks declined.

Marketplace Revenue of $353m for the period represented a 105 per cent
gain on a constant currency basis.

Redbubble CEO, Michael Ilczynski, said: "The strategic priority for the
group now is to ensure we extend the market leadership we have
established.

"We intend to invest in both the artist and customer experiences, to
improve loyalty and retention and to ensure long-term growth."

8.35am: GWA revenue drops, dividend down

Bathrooms and kitchens supplier GWA Group's normalised half year profit
has slipped 17 per cent to $20,014m as a resilient retail sector was
offset by a decline in the commercial and multi-residential supply
segments.

Revenue declined by 4 per cent to $197.2m while earnings before interest
and tax fell 16 per cent to $32m.

A fully franked interim dividend of 6c a share was declared, down from
8c in the prior comparable period.

Managing director Tim Salt said margins were impacted by shipping
delays.

"While our commercial order bank is up on the prior-year, we experienced
timing delays in projects being drawn down which impacted margins and
earnings for the first half," he said.

"We have continued to respond to the short-term challenging market
conditions by remaining disciplined on operational costs, ensuring the
ongoing stability and efficiency of our supply chain and managing our
working capital and cash flow accordingly."

8.33am: BHP declares record interim dividend as iron ore price surges

BHP will pay a record $US1.01 a share interim dividend on the back of
the surging iron ore price, beating analyst expectations and returning a
massive $US5.1bn to shareholders after a strong start to the financial
year.

BHP booked a net profit of $US3.88bn on the back of underlying earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $US14.68bn, and
after the company slashed the value of its thermal coal assets as it
prepares them for sale.

While the statutory profits fell compared to the $US4.9bn it booked
first half of the previous financial year, its underlying net profit of
$US6bn was up 15.4 per cent.

Operational profit of $US9.8bn was up from $US8.3bn the previous
comparable period, on the back of high iron ore prices, record
production from it Pilbara mines and the rising copper price at the back
end of the half.

Analyst consensus had tipped BHP's underlying net profit at $US6.3bn,
before impairments and other write downs, on the back of underlying
earnings before interest and tax of $US11.57bn.

Analysts had expected BHP to return US84c a share in an interim
dividend, or about $US4.24bn.

8.29am: Breville 'double digit growth' boosts profit; dividend sliced

Home appliances group Breville has posted a 29.2 per cent rise in
half-year net profit to $64.2 million as all regions for the company
posted double digit growth and the working from home trend helped fill
up kitchens and new home offices with a range of its toasters, sandwich
makers and coffee machines.

However the December half dividend was almost sliced in half as the
company decided to pivot its cash to growth opportunities.

Breville said on Tuesday that revenue for the period increased 28.8 per
cent to $711m as earnings lifted 29.6 per cent to $94.6m. Improved gross
margins, up 1.1 per cent, was driven by lower promotional spend, swing
in mix to premium products, and a weaker US dollar, which more than
offset increased freight costs.

Breville declared an interim dividend of 13 cents per shares, down from
20.5 cents last year, with the company saying the reduced payout
reflected a decision to reduce target payout ratio to allow continued
funding of growth opportunities on a cash-neutral basis.

Chief executive Jim Clayton said it was a good half for the group,
building on the momentum seen over the last few reporting periods and
benefiting from the work from home phenomenon.

"All regions and categories delivered growth, despite experiencing very
different and erratic retail backdrops. We continued to accelerate our
double-digit EBIT growth, while tactically investing in selected growth
drivers and capabilities. Geographic expansion is delivering an
increasingly diversified and balanced global portfolio, adding growth
and resilience in a dynamic market environment."

In the Americas revenue rose 29.1 per cent to $314.9m, in Europe, Middle
East and Africa revenue rose 56.1 per cent to $145.3m and in the Asia
Pacific revenue lifted 49.7 per cent to $132.8m.

8.01am: NAB cash earnings up 1 per cent; revenue down 3 per cent

National Australia Bank has reported a 1.0 per cent rise in unaudited
first quarter cash earnings to $1.65bn.

Unaudited statutory net profit for the quarter was $1.7bn, NAB told the
ASX.

Revenue declined 3 per cent.

The bank said the revenue decline reflected lower markets and treasury
income, mainly due to non-repeat of mark-to-market loss reversals in the
second half of fiscal 2020.

Meanwhile, expenses for the period fell by 1 per cent with NAB saying
that productivity benefits and lower restructuring related costs were
partly offset by provisions for higher performance-based compensation.

"At an underlying level performance has been sound in the current
competitive, low interest rate environment," said NAB chief executive
Ross McEwan.

7.50am: Ansell posts 'record organic sales' as demand soars

Gloves and protective clothing maker Ansell has delivered "record
organic sales" and earnings as demand continues to soar during the
Covid-19 pandemic.

And the company is expecting demand to continue to persist in a
post-pandemic world as people adopt better hygiene measures and
developing countries apply improved safety measures.

Revenue surged 24.5 per cent to $US937.8m ($1.2bn) in the six months to
December 31. Meanwhile net profit leapt 61.9 per cent to $US106.5m.

"We expect that Covid-19 will continue to impact the world for some time
and once the pandemic is under control, elevated demand for our products
is likely to persist, whether due to enhanced safety practices at plants
and hospitals, better protection awareness in emerging markets, more
research & testing activities worldwide or the potential need for annual
Covid-19 vaccinations," chief executive Magnus Nicolin said.

Ansell's healthcare division was the main earnings driver, with overall
sales rising 39.2 per cent to $US594.7m. This compares to revenue across
its industrial business framing 7 per cent to $US388.1m.

Ansell will pay a dividend of US33.2c a share on March 10 - and increase
of 52.6 per cent on last year's payout. This reflects the company moving
to a proportional dividend policy, targeting a payout ratio of 40-50 per
cent.

7.35am: Reckon core cloud software focus after ReckonDocs sale

Reckon has sold ReckonDocs to NowInfinity, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Class Ltd, and Class Ltd for $13m.

In a statement to the ASX, Reckon said the transaction is unconditional
and expected to complete on 1 March 2021.

The deal will help to reduce Reckon's debt and provide additional
development funds for Reckon's "cloud first" development strategy for
small business accounting and payroll, and practice management for
accountants and lawyers.

The division contributed revenue of $5m and EBITDA of $3m to the 2020
Reckon Group results.

The ReckonDocs Business is currently part of Reckon's Accountant
Practice Management Group for company formations, trust deeds and other
related documents and services.

Reckon said the sale of this business will enable a stronger focus in
Reckon's core cloud software initiatives and tighter integration of its
Accountants Group products with Class products over time.

7.10am: ASX poised to rise after markets extend gains

Australian stocks are set to open higher after strong rises in European
markets, oil and copper. Wall Street was closed for a holiday.

At about 7am (AEDT) the SPI futures index was up 19 points, or 0.3 per
cent.

Yesterday, Australia's sharemarket closed 0.9 per cent higher, its best
rise in six days.

Copper rose 0.8 per cent to $US8422.50 a tonne, its highest level since

The Australian dollar is higher at US77.83c.

6.24am: Social network Parler announces relaunch

Conservative-friendly social network Parler announced it was relaunching
after being forced offline over incitements to violence on the platform.

Parler, which calls itself "the free speech social network", came under
scrutiny following the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.

Apple and Google pulled the network's app from their download platforms
and Amazon's web hosting service cut ties as well.

"Parler was built to offer a social media platform that protects free
speech and values privacy and civil discourse," interim CEO Mark Meckler
said in a statement.

He added the network was determined to return despite being taken
offline "by those who desire to silence tens of millions of Americans".

Parler, which claims to have over 20 million users, said it was back for
users that already had its app. New users won't be able to get access
until next week.

6.05am: Vaccine optimism sends oil back above $US60

The price of oil rose to its highest level in more than a year on
optimism the rollout of vaccines will breathe new life into global
economies.

Inoculation hopes and a tightening of supplies from the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has driven up oil prices in
recent weeks to pre-pandemic levels.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 1.5 per cent, past
the psychologically important $US60 a barrel to hit $US60.95 on Monday,
a level not seen since early January of 2020.

Brent Crude was up 1.46 per cent to $US63.32 a barrel.

Analysts have raised alarms that oil prices could fall dramatically.
While Demand for oil is low because of the pandemic, the concern is that
producers might bring more supply online at these prices, which would
send prices back down.

"The robust recovery in oil prices and industrial metals over the past
couple of months is driving the idea of a new commodities supercycle in
which prices remain above-trend for many years to come," Hussein Sayed,
chief market strategist at FXTM, said.

4.50am: Markets extend rally on recovery hopes

Global stock markets and oil prices soared, boosted by progress on Covid
vaccinations and increasing chances of a vast US stimulus, dealers said.

London equities jumped 2.5 per cent and the pound rallied following
weekend news that more than 15 million people in Britain have so far
received Covid-19 vaccines.

Sterling leapt to $US1.3918, which was the highest point since April
2018, while the euro sank to 87.18 pence, a level last seen in May.

Paris stocks soared 1.5 per cent and Frankfurt gained 0.4 per cent,
while Milan won 0.8 per cent after former European Central Bank boss
Mario Draghi was named Saturday as Italy's new prime minister.

Wall Street was closed on Monday for US Presidents Day.

"There's real momentum behind the global recovery trade and with every
passing week, it seems investors are becoming more optimistic about it,"
OANDA analyst Craig Erlam said.

"The vaccine rollout is providing enormous encouragement, with the UK
surpassing 15 million vaccinations and the topic of conversation finally
turning to reopening the economy," he added.

Stocks have been surging for months as vaccination programs kick into
gear and fewer people come down with the virus, fuelling hopes that
economically painful containment measures can begin to be lifted.

Oil hit peaks not seen since last January, with New York crude topping
$US60 per barrel, boosted also by supply fears amid a severe cold snap
in key producer state Texas.

In Asia, Tokyo was the standout performer on Monday, with the Nikkei 225
breaking through 30,000 points for the first time in 31 years as data
showed Japan's economy performed better than expected at the end of last
year.

Bitcoin retreated after hitting a new record of $US49,694.24 over the

week to make it easier for people to use the cryptocurrency. It stood at

4.48am: Okonjo-Iweala named first female, African WTO boss

Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was appointed as the first female and
first African head of the beleaguered World Trade Organisation, saying a
stronger WTO would be vital for the global coronavirus recovery.

The WTO called a virtual special general council meeting at which member
states officially selected the former Nigerian finance minister and
World Bank veteran as the global trade body's new director-general.

She will take up her post on March 1 and her term, which is renewable,
will run until August 31, 2025.

The near-paralysed institution desperately needs a kickstart --
something Okonjo-Iweala immediately addressed after being confirmed in
the job.

"A strong WTO is vital if we are to recover fully and rapidly from the
devastation wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic," the 66-year-old economist
said in a statement.

"I look forward to working with members to shape and implement the
policy responses we need to get the global economy going again.

"Our organisation faces a great many challenges but working together we
can collectively make the WTO stronger, more agile and better adapted to
the realities of today." South Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee had
been the only other remaining contender for the post but pulled out when
it became clear that new US President Joe Biden was swinging firmly
behind Okonjo-Iweala's candidacy.

4.45am: Jaguar car brand to go fully electric from 2025

Jaguar, the Indian-owned luxury car brand, will produce only electric
vehicles from 2025 and restructure its UK non-manufacturing operations,
the company announced.

"By the middle of the decade, Jaguar will have undergone a renaissance
to emerge as a pure electric luxury brand," said a statement from Jaguar
Land Rover, which intends to become a net zero carbon company by 2039.

JLR said it "will substantially reduce and rationalise its
non-manufacturing infrastructure in the UK".

It did not say whether this meant job cuts were on the horizon. JLR will
meanwhile invest £2.5 billion ($US3.5 billion, 2.9 billion euros)
annually under its 'Reimagine' plan, which sees the first all-electric
Land Rover model in 2024.

"At the heart of its Reimagine plan will be the electrification of both
Land Rover and Jaguar brands on separate architectures with two clear,
unique personalities," the statement said.

4.40am: Vivendi plans Universal Music spin-off

Investors flocked into the French media conglomerate Vivendi after it
unveiled plans to spin off the lucrative Universal Music Group, a move
long sought by analysts as well as its own top shareholders.

Vivendi owns 80 per cent of UMG, whose artists and catalogue range from
the Beatles to Lady Gaga, after recently selling 20 per cent to China's
Tencent group.

In December, Universal shocked many in the industry by announcing a deal
to secure the rights to Bob Dylan's entire back catalogue of songs,
reportedly for more than $US300 million.

On Saturday, the company said it would study the distribution of 60 per
cent of UMG to Vivendi shareholders in order to reduce what it called a
"conglomerate discount." "Vivendi's leading institutional shareholders
have been pressing for a number of years for a split or the distribution
of Universal Music Group," it said.

Vivendi said UMG, which would be listed on the Amsterdam stock market,
could be worth at least 30 billion euros ($US36.4 billion).

The deal, set to be voted on at a shareholder meeting in March, sent
Vivendi's stock rocketing 18 per cent higher to 30.82 euros in Paris.

The company's other assets range from movies and TV production to
publishing and advertising.

MILK DELIVERY STARTUPS MAKE A SPLASH IN GROCERIES MARKET

Highlight: Change the way dairy reaches homes Win more customers by also
supplying other essentials

Body

Bengaluru resident Mahipat Kulkarni places about 20 orders for fresh
milk and groceries on an app every month, rarely setting foot inside a
supermarket or a local shop. His preferred supplier of morning items is
not a bigbrand online store, but a relatively new entrant.

“I have been using the DailyNinja app for five months now, and I get my
delivery by 7 am. It's a convenient option for working professionals.
The best part is I can place an order as late as 11 pm and still expect
things on my doorstep early next day,” Kulkarni said.

DailyNinja, Milkbasket, and Doodhwala are among the new stars in the
growing hyperlocal delivery space, changing the way dairy reaches homes.
They are cracking aggregation and micro-delivery, competing, in some
ways, with well-funded firms like Bigbasket and Grofers.

The three startups operate on a subscription model, but also accommodate
standalone orders. Though milk deliveries form a huge chunk of their
sales, around 70%, they are also seeing good numbers in groceries.
Milkbasket, in fact, earns more from nonmilk products.

“The most ordered product on our platform may be milk, but it
contributes less than 25% of the revenue. Bread, tea, fruits,
vegetables, and other products make most of the money,” Anant Goel,
co-founder of the Gurugram-based company, told STOI.

Sagar Yarnalkar, CEO of DailyNinja, said each user on his platform
ordered household essentials up to 22 times a month. Roping in existing
milkmen helped the Sequoiabacked startup build its customer base. “We
have partnered with 2,200 milkmen in Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, and
Hyderabad. We cater to up to 85,000 households daily,” he said.

Milkbasket, on the other hand, steers clear of the existing network of
local suppliers. “We have our own supply chain and network of delivery
partners. One of the pain points we wanted to resolve was the
inconsistency of neighbourhood milkmen, so partnering with them didn't
make sense,” Goel said.

Bengaluru-based Doodhwala has its own delivery personnel, though it has
tieups with existing milk vendors. “We are operationally profitable now
and are looking to expand to tier 2 cities,” said co-founder Ebrahim
Akbari. Doodhwala has operations in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune,
registering 1.3 million to 1.5 million transactions a month.

“The delivery costs just 5% of the total sale volume. We get over 20
orders a month, with each customer spending anywhere between Rs 2,400 to
Rs 4,000,” Akbari said.

Growing consumer interest in organic milk and A2 varieties has also
worked in the favour of hyperlocal delivery startups. “One has to make a
trip to a department store to purchase MoooFarm organic milk because the
local distribution system is not robust enough for daily delivery of
such varieties. Apps not only list them among products, but also promise
delivery by 7 am,” Pune resident Samir Kulkarni.

According to Akbari, premium milk varieties account for 25% of
Doodhwala's total sales. “We have over 70 varieties, including ones sold
by mass milk and premium organic brands,” he said.

The startups say they are witnessing a growth of 20% every month,
retaining 85% of customers for six months on average. The strong numbers
have caught the attention of venture capital firms such as Kalaari,
Blume Ventures, Matrix Partners, and Sequoia. According to data from
Tracxn, $28 million was invested in this space last year, a huge jump
from the funding pledged in 2017.

Arpit Agarwal, principal, Blume Ventures, said the startups remove a
major irritant for families in tier 1 cities. “Many urban customers are
ready to pay a premium to get fresh milk and groceries delivered to
their homes every day. The startups provide a good customer experience,
which gives them room to scale up and grow at a good pace. They also
have the pricing power,” he said.

In 2014-15, many hyperlocal delivery startups tasted success and failure
in a short span. One of them, Pepper-Tap, later shut down. Milk-Basket
and DailyNinja, which were founded in 2015, survived and are now leaders
in the space. They received funding in 2018. “There was little interest
in the initial three years, but we kept growing. After investors took
note in 2018, we were able to raise money 3 times that year,” said
Milkbasket's Goel said.

Sagar of DailyNinja said the company had witnessed exponential growth in
the past year. “From 17,000 orders a day 12 months ago, we have grown 4x
to touch 70,000 orders a day,” he said.

Players like Bigbasket and Swiggy are keenly following the space.
Bigbasket has entered the market by acquiring two startups, RainCan and
Morning Cart, whereas Swiggy has bought SuprDaily. Swiggy has also
opened stores in Gurugram.

But other micro-delivery startups are not looking for a buyer. “If our
business was one-tenth of its current scale, it would have made sense to
be acquired. However, we want to make it on our own,” said Doodhwala
co-founder Akbari.

Yarnalkar of DailyNinja said his company's business model was different
from that of other delivery startups. “We are not look at launching
private labels in near future and wish to focus on delivery and customer
acquisition,” he said.

global pandemic. Chronic stress and disrupted lifestyle have pushed
individuals on the brink of burnout.

In a recent survey from American Express, 76% of respondents are willing
to spend more on travel that helps in enhancing their well-being.55% of
them are eager to pay a premium for wellness activities in their
upcoming vacations.

Post-pandemic travelers are more cautious and aware of their wellbeing.
Instead of cramming popular destinations, they are looking for nature
experiences,holistic wellnessexperiences, adventure, and exploration in
the most fulfilling way. Wellness resorts, wellness tourism
facilitators, wellhomes, wellness guides, coaches, and therapists are
just a few cogs of the wellness wheel.

Wellness gets integrated into medical treatments- the new normal
experience

Medical tourists now seek holistic experiences that cover consultation,
treatment, hospital stay, recovery, and mind-relaxing rejuvenating
exercises. It may not be always shopping and site seeing but regaining
well-being in a meaningful way to stave off diseases or manage chronic
conditions better.

Wellness vacation modes are expanding

Vacationing is no more /just a short duration activity-packed
destination visit. Slow travel, mixing vacation and work, staying at a
second home, or spending few days in nature away from home are
emergingtrends in wellness travel.We have been seeing rapid emergence
ofstaycations, workcations, drivecations, schoolcations, etc. aimed at a
balanced work-life-play-wellbeing situation. Even if travellers are not
entirely focused on wellness, they do take interest in unique
experiences conducive to their mental and emotional wellbeing.

Hospitality gets the wellness touch

Gone are the days of crammed hotels and accommodations. Discerning
travelers are looking for wellness spaces for enhanced sensory
experiences. Existing hospitality facilities are going for wellness
makeover not only through back-office integration but emerging as
wellness hospitality brands.

People are looking for 'Second Homes'

The sales for vacation homes and retirement homes have skyrocketed in
the recent years in many countries. People with disposable incomes are
interested in attractive propositions to spend some leisure time in
offbeat serene locations or some places away from the crowded urban
population.

Purchasing a second home is looked upon as an attractive investment also
especially in Sales and Leaseback Model but also a choice of better
lifestyle and asset diversification.Senior living facility is also
getting refurbished with improved wellbeing standards in daily living
that would help in encountering aging with ease.

Wellness Tourism Startups are getting investors' attention

Despite the complete shutdown of tourism due to covid, institutional
investors are finding propositions in wellness tourism startups worth
investing. And funding in wellness tourism businesses has picked up.But
the market largely untapped coupled with emerging opportunities will not
go dry for long.

People have learned to live with the virus. They are ready for travel
but with enough caution and protection. How long human beings can remain
locked up? The pent-up demand is brewing and it is just days away for
travel to grow with full throttle. Institutional investors are keeping
an eye on recent happenings in wellness tourism market, and will be
eager to put their money for some bigger returns.

Why do you need funding for wellness tourism business?

Whether you self-fund your wellness tourism business or take help from
family and friends, you will need more funding as you pick up the growth
track.

Top reasons are likely:

* Launch your business if your self-financing efforts fall short to
achieve the critical amount.

* Expand and diversify your business by hiring, introducing new
technology or launching new products and services.

* Make yourself visible to a larger market segment.

* Most importantly, prove legitimacy and add credibility to your
business.

How much investment do you need?

It depends upon your proposed business model and mode of operations. The
initial investment could be between $5000- $10000. If you are not sure,
you can contact a globally reputed wellness tourism consultancy. One of
the plus points in wellness tourism business is that you need not need a
big set up or a big workforce, and therefore the funding requirement
will be much less.

Before thinking of getting funding for your wellness tourism business,
you need to have a clear vision about what role you are going to play in
the market. What value you will add to customers? You have a plethora of
options to explore.

Again, the investment will depend upon what you plan to offer and other
aspects related to business operations. As your startup gets
operational, you will need wellness tourism consultants to plan your
funding through potential investors for further diversification and
brand building.

Finding the funding

From where can you get the funding? Which could be the possible sources
from where you can expect funding? What is their background and
financial capabilities? Which industries do they belong to? How
effective would they be in driving other stakeholders' investments?
These need to be identified first.

They could be:

* People interested in wellness tourism agencies, wellness resorts,
wellness hotels, wellness spas or wellness real estate.

* Salaried employees, retired professionals, consultants, small-time
entrepreneurs

* Banks and financial institutions

* Government funding and loans

A credible legal structure is important to get funding for your wellness
tourism business

What is the nature of your business entity? Normally, startups opt for a
minimum expense frame that is simple devoid of any complexity. Else
legal ambiguities and complications will put off investors. A legal
entity also protects you from unlimited liabilities. It is recommended
to create a LLC (Limited Liability Company).

Best Sources of Funding for your wellness tourism business

Now that you have chalked your business objectives and ready with a
great business plan, you can explore the following sources for funding.

Seed funding

You need some funds for your business to germinate. It could be your
personal savings or contributions from your family and friends.
Sometimes you can source it from crowdfunds and Angel Investors.

Series Round

You take the next step, and the series round goes like A, B, C, and so
on. You get into the real funding mechanism of your wellness tourism
business. Money will come from institutional investors. As your business
grows in valuation, you draw more investors and your entrepreneurial
skills get established.

More investors pump money in your business, your startup valuation
appreciates. There is no hard and fast rule regarding the investment
amount in successive rounds, but the following is the general trend.

* Round A - Between $1-3 million

* Round B - Between $3-10 million

* Round C - Between $10-30 million

* Round D- Between 30-100 million

You should know the fine demarcations of successive rounds to have a
better grasp of the funding process and what attracts investors. Rounds
A, B, and C are the initial stages of your startup journey before it
crosses milestones.

Venture Capital Funding

Your wellness tourism startup will attract Venture Capitalists (VCs)
only if you have built up a decent customer base. This shows your
business demand, builds profitability and a healthy balance sheet. VCs
step in when you need substantial funds for diversification in business
and workforce. They will look for some equity share in your business to
secure their investments. Naturally, they might also have a say in your
operations which might not always tally with your way of running the
business.You may be asked to change your business policies also. VCs are
expected to be experienced business persons and may help you with useful
guidance in strategic planning.

Their funding usually runs for 6 years on average which is likely to
improve your bottom line. Wellness tourism businesses see many great
venture capitalists funding. It is recommended you start growing a
network with VCs from the initial days of your business as it takes time
to convince them about your business potential. VCs set very high
targets achieving which could be quite a tough job

Angel Investors

You will find Angel Investors more willing to invest in your wellness
tourism business. Therefore, do not lag in efforts to get their
attention. They are easily available and bring a wealth of experience
and insights into your business. Wellness tourism businesses offer more
tangible benefits which are likely to draw their attention. Angel
Investors also have the potential to fetch more investments from their
close circuit if they find emotional connection with your business.

They will take more interest about their potential ROI than your
operation mechanism. So you need to have strong foundations to convince
them. Research about their objectives whether they want to have
ownership stake in your business or not. If you have a great business
plan and outstanding delivery mechanism, you will win their confidence.
Angel Investors can get deeply involved in vital aspects of your
business and make their opinions count. They might look for some
personal opportunities in your business. Facing all these could be a
real challenge for which you need a special mindset.

Equity Funding

In Equity Funding, people buy a part of ownership rights by investing in
equity. The biggest benefit is that you will not have to repay the loan
but pay dividends as agreed upon. You can get benefit from their
knowledge and experience but the challenge will be to maintain your
control over the business and allow them to have their say.

SMERGERs

This is a suitable option for those willing to enter into a venture with
leading wellness centers, clinics, spas, hotels, resorts, etc. This is
an online platform where you will find many global investors and
acquirers. You will have to put in all the necessary details about your
wellness tourism business like location, offerings, viable projections,
estimations and all that will sound attractive to investors. All your
queries will be open to public so that potential investors can find you
easily. You can also get expert guidance to run your business from the
early phase.

Government Initiatives

As tourism picks up, governments of leading wellness tourism
destinations are likely to offer feasible funding initiatives for small
and medium wellness tourism startups. Government support adds
credibility creating a win-win situation. Government loans can help in
launching great ideas and models to meet the growing volume and changing
demands of wellness travelers.

Capital Loans

If you are planning to launch a wellness resort or convert your existing
hotel or resort into a wellness facility, you can think of obtaining
capital loans for construction. Typically, 70% of wellness resort
expenses can be attributed to construction. Apart from banks and
financial institutions, you can get it from real estate development
companies or private commercial real estate lenders.

You need a robust tie up between your business and the bank to acquire a
financial guarantee.Banks and other financial institutions are likely to
finance 75% of your loan requirements, the balance you will have to fund
yourself or from other sources. However, you will have to show
collateral security or mortgage your resort while the loan is repaid.

Time sharing wellness resort business model

With the growing penchant for vacationing in a wellness resort, this
model could serve as a great way to fund your wellness tourism business.
It won't be easy to sell the idea of shared vacation ownership.
Prospective investors should have good knowledge of wellness tourism
trends and the relevance of wellness resorts.

The financial risk is low for the investor as they will be buying the
property for a fraction of the year. So, they will put a fraction of
their money. In return, they will have the option to spend some days of
the years as per mutually-agreed basis for a holiday in your resort of
shared ownership. Naturally, such properties are located at great nature
destinations. The customer will also have the choice to rent it out to a
third party if he is not vacationing. The resort does not remain idle at
all.

Funds sourced from sales- leaseback

Sales and Leaseback model could be a great source of funding for
wellness resorts and hotels be it an existing facility or an upcoming
one. This model has been extremely popular in Europe especially in the
famous holiday destination of Canary Islands. Growing pressure of
operation costs and other expenses is driving resort developers and
owners consider this option in the US and Asian destinations.

The wellness resort or hotel owner can leaseback their property to a
customer looking for lucrative investment option and a second home
exclusively for vacationing purpose. This frees the equity trapped in
the immovable property and the owner gets handsome cash to meet other
business needs.

Mezzanine funding

This is a mix of debt and equity financing. For equity, the fund
supplier is entitled to a participation in profit which is not
guaranteed. Depending upon availability of profit and liquidity of the
fund he will receive a dividend.

This is typically suitable for capital intensive types of business like
wellness resorts. Cash flow is volatile and liquidity is available.
Mezzanine investors improve the funding network for the resort. The
promoter doesn't have to depend upon a single source of funding.

For the debt part the fund supplier will get a guaranteed return on
investment irrespective of profitability of the wellness resort.
Convertibility between Debt and Equity particularly is allowed. If the
borrower (the promoter of the wellness resort) fails to meet his
obligation to pay dividends, the lender can convert his Debt into equity
ownership.

Key Money funding

This type of funding is available from an investor who is already in the
hospitality business. When they see an opportunity to invest in a
property in a prime location, they supply money to book this property
having a good sales potential. The investor, which itself usually is a
hotel, pays an advance money to secure its entry and equity in a resort.

The hospitality company that contributes the key money to the
promoter/owner operates the resort. The percentage mix between the debt
loan and equity financing can be in varying ratios.

Key money is required in expensive projects where competition between
resort operators is stiff. Key money can be huge contributions running
into millions of dollars. Gaining access to the potential customers
needs heavy funding often to expand the capacity. This happens when the
resort fails to handle a very high volume of customers simply because of
its limited acreage. The primary advantage of key money arrangement is
that it lightens the financial responsibility on the promoter. It allows
him financial liquidity during the construction phase of the wellness
resort.

Property appraised clean energy funding (PACE)

It encourages participation of private entrepreneurship in the
construction of a wellness resort. The scheme is designed for upfront
payment for funding. The loan is repaid over a period of 10 to 20 years
through property assessments which are guaranteed by the attachment of
the property itself and paid in addition to the promoter's property tax
dues.

The benefits of PACE funding are as follows

* The interest on borrowed funds has a cheaper rate. This is because the
loan repayments are guaranteed as they are tied up with property tax
bills.

* It can offer financing up to 20 % of the total capital requirements.

* The capital is annexed to the resort itself and so it is binding on
the owners. In case of defaulting repayment, the property is attached
and sold off to recover the lent money.

* Has access to a large pool of private capital.

Subordinated Debt Funding

A wellness resort can draw Subordinated debt fund but the rate of
interest to be paid is quite high. This is because Subordinated debt
fund is the loan to be paid from the residual money after all other
debts and obligations are settled.

So this type of funding agreement is pretty much unsecured in case the
promoter defaults. If the promoter is prepared to pay a high rate of
interest he can opt for such loans.

Since Subordinated debts are risky the promoter of the resort can expect
the fund suppliers to be very wary about the solvency of the resort
business. But Subordinated debts are repaid before redemption of equity
holders.

Tips to get quick funding for your wellness tourism startup

Although funding from VCs in startups touched new highs, they take a
very cautious approach while investing in new startups. Here we share a
few valuable tips to get quick funding for your wellness tourism
strartup.

Do Reverse Engineering in Investment

Did you know that startups bagged $156 billion investment in 2020 up by
$56 billion from the previous year?

What is the business potential of the industry? Check the salient points
listed above. What are your offerings and who are the potential takers?
Work backward to understand your sales potential that will justify your
investment and investor's needs.

Plan investment and funding Expenses stepwise

90% of businesses fail due to a weak business model and faulty expense
planning.

Your chances of securing investment rest on some key pillars. Work on
your business concept and philosophy. Apart from profiteering, your
business should display the purpose of wellness. Build your philosophy
on that.

Many institutional investors get attracted towards humanitarian and
community upliftment purpose. Capital is flowing in businesses that help
to improve people's daily lives. Do a feasibility analysis. Be mindful
of product and service development. Get your financial projections
right.

Create a strong and crisp business plan

A study shows entrepreneurs with a written formal business plan get
moreformal financial assistancethan those without a plan. 70% VCs
perceive a written business plan very important.

No great idea should be in your head but put down on a paper. Investors
will see what is in front of them not what is hidden in your brain.
Convincing your wellness tourism business idea cannot be done verbally.
You need to document those.

Is your startup worth the investors' risk? Why the investor will put
money in your business? A strong business plan will bear the testimony
to it. What are your objectives? How will you serve the wellness tourism
market? Most importantly, what difference you are going to make in the
existing scenario? All of these should be clearly defined in thebusiness
plan.

Your plan should also talk about in details:

* Complete description of your offerings

* Your deep understanding of the target market and business viability

* Competitive analysis

* Financial projections

* Growth forecast model

* Elaborate marketing plan

* Pricing and promotional strategies

* Barriers to entry in the market

Understand the technicality of Investment

Global funding grew by $8 Billion in 2021

The scenario is encouraging but that does not give you the reason to put
lesser efforts. You need to have a deep understanding of the investors
and the different mechanisms that go into the startup investment
ecosystem. Get educated about angel investors, seed funding, venture
capital, and equity investments.How they work and what is required from
you to get the funding from them. Devote enough time to study all these
factors. Enrolling in a wellness tourism masterclass or startup training
courses will help.

How unique is your wellness tourism startup?

Did you know that 90% of startups fail and 34% of startups fail to do so
due to a lack of product-fit market?

This means, either your offering is inadequate or the market does not
exist. You need to envisage the best of ideas that will help in solving
some real problems of wellness enthusiasts and patients seeking specific
wellness programs. The best ideas can only develop if you have a deep
study of the market and the customers' needs and wants. Higher their
demands better are your chances to get new ideas.

Did you know90% of unique business ideas fail in the first five years?
You need to ensure everything is right in your business model, business
plan, financial projections,marketing plans, hiring, etc.

Show networking and partnership

Small companies with Content Marketing and social media generate 67%
more leads

What people say about you impacts your chances of getting business
funding. Build your followers and customers on social media platforms
like Facebook and Instagram. Collect video reviews along with text
reviews to add credibility about your offerings. Social media platforms
create the opportunity to reach out to bigger audience. Use Linkedin to
build your professional credibility, partnerships and connect with
potential investors. Flaunt these while pitching for funding.

Practice minimalism - Focus on a lean model

66% of startups face financial challenges with 43% claiming meeting
operating expenses as the biggest challenge.

Welless tourism covers many aspects, and creating a great business model
needs adequate brainstorming. A lean, efficient, smart, and scalable
business model will easily catch the investors' attention who will feel
secured about much lesser chances of unwanted expenses. Flawed business
model with too much redundant activities is one of the critical factors
of startup failure. When you aim atlean model, you automatically take
care of optimal resource utilization that supports your sustainability
and scalability.

Tap the investors' mindset

A recent survey says,more than 78% of small businesses reported profits.

Your investor should be able to relate well with your idea, else the
entire project may not go well. You may miss the desired profit. To
select the right investor for your wellness tourism startup, you need to
tap the investor's mind.

Wellness tourism business brings in lots of intangible benefits which
make many investors take interest in such ventures. Many such businesses
have been founded on the basis of strong emotional factors from real
life experiences.

The investor's reputation is important but you need the following as
well:

* How well the investor can be an influencer?

* What are their special interests or what is drawing them to your
business?

* Do they strongly believe in your ideas?

* Do they have any additional pleasure points in investing in this kind
of business?

* Will they give you enough room to execute your plans?

Join incubator programs

Business incubators can help in reducing the launching and operating
cost of a startup by 40-50%

Your wellness tourism startup can go haywire if there are certain
loopholes in the business model especially during the early stages.
These businesses have lots of complexities which could pose serious
obstacles for new entrants. Incubator programs are tremendously helpful
in providing guidance, mentorship, and build yourbusiness networking. Do
a background check of the mentors and professionals on board and their
success storiesThis will not only streamline your operating expenses but
also help in finding the right investor for you.

Think of a strategic investor

Strategic investors have an increasing share in startup investments and
can boost 60% revenues

Strategic investors mean you have readily available capital. While VCs
take a more cautious approach to funding, investments from strategic
investors in early stage startups have shot up tremendously. Though
these investments come with a few strings attached, their knowledge,
outreach, and resources can propel your business growth. But be well
informed of their interests and settle for a win-win situation.

Participate in meetings and conferences

57% agree that networking events help you get the right investor

Investors in wellness tourism business are not omnipresent. You need to
really hunt for them at times. Global Wellness Tourism conferences are
held round the year in different countries. In some countries, these are
regular annual events. Participating in these events means you land on a
big platform where you get rare opportunities to meet potential
investors and providers.Do your homework properly to make yourself
presentable in the international platform.

Your pitch deck should leave an impression

Even 10 slides are enough for an impressive pitch deck for new entrants
to get the right investment

All your great ideas and potential of wellness tourism business could go
down the drain if your pitch deck is bland and shoddy. Too long
presentation with overwhelming information can put off your potential
investors. New entrants are more likely to get into these erroneous
steps. It is hard for them to decide which information to keep and which
to discard.Keep your presentation short and crisp. Yourbusiness
propositionsand related information should be presented in a neat flow.
Your investors will be impressed and appreciate you for valuing their
time.

Hire a recognized consultant

Running out of cash is the second most common cause of startup failure
around 29%

Great ideas do not always fetch good funding. Lack of insights, and
exposure pose big problems for getting funding. These are common
happenings when your business is in full operation but you need
additional funds to make it grow more. This is one of the reasons that
many startups shut down after 3-5 years in the market. A recognized
consultant will never allow your cash flow to dry up but help you get
timely funding.

Evian Gutman - a serial entrepreneur, consultant, and author - shares
tips for businesses on pivots during crises, bouncing from failure, and
digital transformation.

Based in Australia, Evian Gutman is the founder of two startups -
Padlifter and Ringcommend. He was earlier a management consultant and
digital marketing head. He is the author of Coming Back from COVID (see
my book review here).

The book provides 300 business recovery tips for small businesses in six
categories - people, operations, product, marketing and sales, growth,
accounting, and finance. In this chat with YourStory, Evian talks about
the journey of an entrepreneur, resilience beyond the pandemic era,
digital transformation, and ecosystem support for entrepreneurship.

Edited excerpts from the interview:

YourStory [YS]: What are the top three contributions digital technology
is making to businesses in the pandemic era?

Evian Gutman [EG]: I like to consider myself a big fan of digital
technologies for a wide range of reasons. However, I always try to
temper my excitement by reminding myself that at the end of the day,
technology itself is just a tool (albeit a powerful one!).

With that being the case, the ability to effectively leverage technology
is equally-reliant on how cutting-edge technologies are utilised, as
much as the sophistication of the technology itself.

Thus, in the post-COVID world, there are several key benefits afforded
by digital technology.

Firstly, technology provides internal opportunities to optimise the
efficiency of business operations. This can take multiple forms like new
machinery that produces products at faster speeds or lower costs, or
improved systems and processes that allow for better and faster
communication patterns and decisions.

Secondly, digital technology enables businesses of all sizes to scale
their offerings on a global scale and provide access to global markets
previously unavailable. Ecommerce means that all businesses now have a
theoretical global footprint to anywhere in the world that has an
internet connection, as well as cost-effective digital marketing tactics
that create new sales channels that can be accessed with the click of a
button.

Thirdly, digital technologies prevent businesses from 'flying blind.'
The COVID-19 pandemic created a lot of question marks and uncertainty.
In contrast, digital technologies remove uncertainty by improving the
visibility afforded to businesses over almost every function of their
business.

These days, there aren't many things that cannot be tracked and
measured. Whether we're talking about the output efficiency of
production processes or the effectiveness of a given online marketing
campaign; modern business owners and operators have no shortage of
data-driven, evidence-based methods for validating the effectiveness of
their efforts and investments, and preventing them from wasting time and
money by going down wrong paths as early as possible.

YS: What are the typical challenges entrepreneurs face as they scale
from startup to growth stage? How can these challenges be addressed?

EG: Being a startup entrepreneur involves wearing many hats. Today, you
might be developing the go-to-market strategy for your latest product
release. Tomorrow, you might be the hiring manager responsible for
doubling the size of your team. And the day after that, you may be the
one raising funds to guarantee that your business lives to experience
another spin around the sun. It's an exciting, but tumultuous journey!

As a startup grows, one of the most challenging things for entrepreneurs
is ceding responsibility for the wearing of all of these hats. What made
you successful yesterday runs the risk of exhausting you to die
tomorrow. And as the size of your startup grows, it becomes untenable to
continue wearing all of these hats and executing all of the functions
that you previously once did.

Savvy entrepreneurs will need to surround themselves with talented and
trusted individuals who are equally (if not more so) capable of carrying
out the core business functions necessary for creating a sustainable
high-performing business.

This challenge is not easy and will make many entrepreneurs feel uneasy
at the beginning. However, by focussing on repeatable processes that
capture best practices and executed by talented team members, the
business will be in a formidable position to continue growing and taking
advantage of all opportunities as they continue to present themselves.

YS: How should innovators strike that delicate balance between 'Stick to
your vision' and 'Adapt to a changed world?'

EG: In the absence of having a crystal ball, even the best of plans have
their innate limitations. What this means is that it is incumbent upon
entrepreneurs to remain dynamic to their ever-changing realities. What
was a good idea yesterday might be a bad idea tomorrow, and vice-versa.
Nonetheless, this doesn't mean that entrepreneurs should take shortcuts
or ignore their planning obligations.

They need to diligently invest in developing exhaustive plans that are
comprehensive in the details. They need to proceed on the assumption
that their plans are robust and represent a formidable approach for
capitalising on identified opportunities. However, they must
simultaneously be testing their assumptions and remain open to adapting
the plan as new and better information comes in.

With this approach, a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement is able
to be developed, that appropriately reconciles the competing objectives
of sticking to the vision while remaining adaptive to a changing world.

YS: Is there such a thing as the 'ideal age' for an entrepreneur, or can
the startup bug strike you at any time? How should people keep
themselves open to adopting an entrepreneurial career later in life?

EG: It's my personal belief that people spend too much time getting
fixated on strict definitions. There is no doubt that there are common
characteristics of startup entrepreneurs. They tend to be 'disruptors.'
They tend to focus on products that utilise new technologies in
innovative ways. They tend to focus on scalable business models.
However, there is no definitive 'shopping list' of what an entrepreneur
needs to be doing to call themselves an entrepreneur.

Some entrepreneurs get their start in the startup game at the age of
five, selling lemonade for a dollar a cup from the front yard of their
parents' house. Other entrepreneurs get into the game much later in
life, after having built a sizable career as a subject-matter expert,
working for many decades across 'traditional' businesses.

Neither makes one better than the other, and each carries respective
pros and cons. What is most important to being an entrepreneur is having
the fire in the belly for simply doing something better. And, this can
come at any age.

People shouldn't try 'retrofit' the entrepreneurial life onto their
circumstances. It's important to recognise that the entrepreneur's life
is not preferable to everyone; and that in many instances,
entrepreneurialism is not always the optimal pathway to pursue.

However, for those to whom the entrepreneurial life resonates, it can
seem like the natural, obvious, and only pathway of pursuit. Having a
connection with a cause will fuel the drive that is necessary for
overcoming the countless obstacles that stand between the vision and the
outcome.

For entrepreneurs of all ages - both young and old - they should take an
honest look in the mirror and ask themselves what they believe their
strengths and weaknesses to be. For those that may be entering the game
slightly later in life, this may mean surrounding themselves with
individuals that can compensate for any personal skill deficiencies, or
upskilling themselves in the requisite ways necessary for addressing any
such identified gaps.

YS: It's one thing to fail with a product, and a bigger dimension to
fail with a company. How should founders regroup in these two
situations?

EG: 'Failure' in the startup world is a dangerous term - what does it
actually mean to 'fail?' Did you fail if your product launch didn't hit
its ambitious objectives? Did your company fail if your revenue targets
weren't hit? It's important to contextualise 'failure' as a distinct
phenomenon when discussed within the context of entrepreneurialism.

When growing a business, failure and audacity sit on the flip sides of
the very same coin. Everything entails an element of risk, and no
outcome is preordained for guaranteeing success. The only true failure
is when this audacity is not backed up with research, due diligence, and
a well-mapped out plan for execution.

Even when those elements are in place, you can be near-certain that at
some point on your entrepreneurial journey to success, you will still
encounter some element of 'failure.' But when tackled with humility,
determination, and capability, you stand the best possible chances of
developing the right strategies that saw you overcome past challenges
too.

From a practical perspective, when product issues emerge, founders
should look towards identifying the root cause of the issue. Is it a
marketing issue? Is it a product-market fit issue? Is it an operational
issue? Or is it a combination of all of these (and maybe others too)?
This is best done by going direct to the market and validating directly
with customers - both existing and potential.

There may also be times where you question the ongoing viability of your
company. Is it worth pushing on? The answer to this question is not
always straightforward. Sometimes a business may be viable, but the
return on effort doesn't justify what's involved in continuing to pour
your heart and soul into keeping it alive.

Where this occurs, founders should have an honest reflection on their
personal feelings towards their reality. They should consider the ease
and practicality of pivoting the business in a new - but more
promising - direction. Again, all of these decisions need to be made
within the context of considering alternative uses of time by the
founder, which may potentially allow them to focus on other
higher-yielding or more immediate and lucrative opportunities.

YS: How should founders evaluate weak signals and anecdotal evidence
which seem to contradict quantitative market trends?

EG: Effective founders do not think about qualitative versus
quantitative evidence as an either/or question. They are both important
and work in complementary ways.

In an ideal world, your quantitative data points will support the
anecdotal 'word on the street.' Sometimes there may be a misalignment,
and sometimes there may be grades in between.

Instead of preferencing one over the other, use any misalignment as a
trigger for further investigation. Why are you seeing and hearing
conflicting reports? Why might consumer sentiment be suggesting a
different story to what the numbers that are jumping off the page are
telling? How effective are your data sources, and how extensively have
you surveyed the market?

Instead of running away from the conflict, use it as an opportunity to
refine and finesse your testing and validation methods. The most
effective founders will inevitably be those that complement their
comprehensive plans with a rigorous continuous improvement framework
that draws on multiple sources of input and evidence to illuminate
honest and accurate insights.

YS: What is your current field of consulting? What kinds of services do
you offer?

EG: My professional background stems originally as a management
consultant, with a focus on helping large blue-chip B2B organisations
optimise their sales performance. Over time, I transitioned into a
digital marketing role. Most recently, I combine these skill sets to
help SMBs, which typically have less than 500 employees and annual
revenue of less than $25 million, across a broad range of business
improvement initiatives.

Many of the businesses I work with are established businesses. Because
of this, I tend to focus on growth strategies that address underlying
performance issues or leverage untapped opportunities. From my
experience, this tends to fall within the broad categories of marketing
and sales, product, growth, operations, team, and accounting and
finance. For that reason, I also structured the book around those very
same categories.

YS: How was your book received? What were some of the unusual responses
and reactions you got?

EG: I think that it's important to recognise that first and foremost,
COVID-19 is a global health crisis, that has resulted in over one
million deaths and left many more than that severely sick. With that
being the case, we need to be respectful when talking about COVID within
the paradigm of business and converting adversities into opportunities.

Within this context, the book has been well-received. In its first month
alone, it was purchased by over 3,600 people. At its peak, it was ranked
#1 on the Amazon Kindle Store for the categories of small business,
starting a business, and business leadership.

Some people were surprised at how quickly the book was able to be
written and published. One of the key themes that I try to emphasise
throughout the book is that it is often in moments of crisis that
ascendancy takes seed. I tried to apply that very principle to writing
this book and making sure that it ended up in the hands of those that
would benefit from it as soon as possible.

YS: In the time since your book was published, what are some notable new
tips or initiatives you would suggest for business recovery?

EG: As an author, there's always a fine line between packing your book
with too much and too little information. On the one hand, you want to
share everything you know in the hope that the more you tell, the more
opportunities there are for someone learning something new. On the other
hand, you want to limit the advice you dispense, so that the insights
you do share are the crme de la crme - the things most likely to really
'move the needle' and make a material impact with the greatest of ease.

If there were one thing I would add to the book today, it is reinforcing
the idea that coming back from COVID is about returning to time-tested
business fundamentals and adapting them to the unique realities and
challenges of our time. At the end of the day, more businesses will be
better off doing a smaller number of things right, than a larger number
of things wrong.

YS: Are there specific case studies you can cite that you think
exemplify business recovery?

EG: I'm reluctant to cite specific companies that adapted well to the
coronavirus crisis - not because they don't exist (they very much do!),
but because they don't do justice to the tens of thousands of small
businesses that may have been equally (if not more so) effective in
overcoming the challenges of COVID, but without the spotlight
necessarily having been shone upon them.

We are all familiar with many of the 'poster boy' companies that have
done well throughout the COVID pandemic - how many people had used Zoom
video-conferencing technologies before 2020? How many people increased
their online purchases this year for groceries, clothes, and household
essentials?

I believe the true "success stories," however, are the small businesses
that were quick to pivot without necessarily having the experience nor
resources, for otherwise doing so.

As an example, many cafes and restaurants were forced to close for
several months during government-mandated lockdowns. Instead of throwing
their hands up in the air and lamenting their challenging reality, many
decided to adapt and tweak their offering by introducing new and
innovative take-away and/or delivery options. Once the lockdowns were
lifted, a lot of these same restaurants kept these new offerings, having
found that they represented lucrative new revenue streams (irrespective
of COVID).

As another example, there is a small hardware business that I recently
consulted. They ran a local area marketing campaign that promoted the
idea of DIY (Do It Yourself) home improvement fixes. With lockdowns in
place, limits on social gatherings, and more free time available, they
promoted the idea that now was the perfect time to complete all those
jobs that people had been meaning to get around to for a long time yet,
never did. As a result of these marketing campaigns, 2020 turned out to
be one of the most profitable years on record for this particular
business.

YS: How can social entrepreneurs and non-profit organisations make use
of your frameworks and tips?

EG: Over the last few decades, there has been a growing trend towards
the professionalisation of the NFP (not-for-profit) sector. This should
come as no great surprise (and ideally, should have come about much
sooner!).

While the goals and KPIs of social entrepreneurs and NFP organisations
might be different from the hard-dollar focus on 'for-profit' startups,
many of the strategies for goal realisation remain nonetheless the same.

Even if what they are "selling" is not a product in the traditional
sense of the word, they still have a clear-cut offering that needs to be
effectively marketed, operationalised by an efficient organisation
staffed with a capable team, and run in a financially-viable way.

For all of these reasons, the best thing a social entrepreneur can do is
see themselves as cut from the same cloth as any other for-profit
business leader.

YS: What are the top three success factors for government and industry
to work together and sustain entrepreneurship in their countries?

EG: I believe that 'internal' communication, 'external' communication,
and incentives/risk-sharing represent three of the biggest success
factors for promoting government and industry to work together in
sustaining entrepreneurship in their respective countries.

By 'internal' communication, I am referring to 'intra' communication
between a particular industry and government. Forward-thinking
industries will keep the government abreast of developments that stand
to benefit the economy and society. Dangling these carrots in front of
the government will help get them excited about opportunities, which
will pave the way for the government to then feel comfortable in leading
the charge and creating the conditions necessary for supporting relevant
projects and initiatives.

While we often think of a 'chicken-and-egg' scenario between industry
and government that has the potential to stagnate progress, there are
many opportunities for industry to adopt a leadership role in directing
the conversation and shepherding everyone onto the same page.

By 'external' communication, I am referring to marketing the wins to the
general public. Government and industry have a powerful opportunity (and
vested interest) in communicating the possibilities that can come
through effective collaboration. Speaking in lockstep will not only
illuminate these possibilities but also help mitigate any objections. In
doing so, many of the roadblocks that stand in the way of progress and
outcomes, will be cleared, enabling both parties to effectively promote
these initiatives to the public.

Finally, there should be an element of incentivisation and risk-sharing
by the government. Entrepreneurs put a lot on the line without much
security or certainty of outcome. With that being the case, anything the
government can do to alleviate any of this risk will be a welcomed
gesture by industry and entrepreneurs.

This can come in many forms, though in its most explicit manifestation
will come in the form of financial incentives. Loan guarantees, tax
credits, cash-flow boosts, financial grants, and assistance are but some
of the measures that government can offer to demonstrate their
willingness to work with industry in shouldering some of the risk
entailed in entrepreneurship.

YS: What is your next book going to be about?

EG: As much as I love helping businesses activate high-impact growth and
stability strategies, I think that we're all feeling an element of
'COVID-fatigue' right now. It seems like no matter which way you look,
COVID is the topic of conversation one way or another - either directly
or indirectly.

I've had some thoughts recently around how many of the pressing
challenges we face on both an individual and global scale are driven by
a narrow attachment to hard-and-fast rules, that imagine there is only
one "right answer." Such an approach is not always conducive to optimal
outcomes and fails to recognise the legitimacy of alternative
perspectives.

As they say, two plus two equals four, but so does three plus one. Two
very different approaches can simultaneously yield equally-optimal
outcomes, without necessarily discrediting the legitimacy of the other.

While I haven't yet thought all of this through to its logical endpoint,
I would like my next book to focus upon these ideas. I'd like to explore
detaching ego from objectives, and utilising broad multi-disciplinary
approaches for arriving at optimal outcomes. I believe that all of these
ideas already resonate with the entrepreneur's mindset and general
approach to problem-solving too.

YS: What are your parting message to the startups and aspiring
entrepreneurs in our audience?

EG: I'm a big advocate for taking a broad perspective on 'success.' If
you ever zoomed in to a specific moment-in-time, and asked whether any
startup or entrepreneurial initiative was "successful," you would obtain
a very incomplete answer to that question - what had taken place before,
and what was likely to take place after? How many challenges have
already been overcome, and how many more lie on the horizon? How
scalable and repeatable are the successes, and how effectively have
known obstacles been mitigated or extinguished?

All of these things matter.

It's now become a bit of a clich, but entrepreneurialism is a marathon -
not a sprint. And, when you combine capable humans with that fire in the
belly, and a solid offering for overcoming an identified problem, then
you have a recipe for success and a good reason to believe that positive
fortunes lie ahead for the entrepreneur, one way or another.

We need to stop glorifying innovation. Here's why.

IT Next

August 14, 2018

Length: 1075 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Aug. 14 -- In the United States, and to a lesser extent
around the world, we've been glorifying innovation for the past century
or more. But if we want to create a balanced society, which can sustain
itself while continuing to progress, it's time we come to terms with the
reality of innovation, and stop neglecting the other components of a
productive, progressive society.

First, I want to explore why we value innovation so much.

There's the idea that innovation is inherently superior to maintenance
or straightforward progression. For example, a new vacuum cleaner with a
longer attachment system isn't a real innovation, but a robotic vacuum
cleaner that cleans your floors autonomously is.

Innovation has the power to change our lives for the better, making
things more convenient and cost-effective, and some of the devices we've
seen emerge from our prioritization of innovation-such as smartphones
and emerging self-driving vehicles-would seem to verify that.

Innovation in a capitalistic society also has the potential to breed
billionaires. You can work your whole life in an established path and
maybe make enough money to retire, or you can innovate something that
saves thousands of hours a year, and retire wealthy while you're still
young. And since we tend to equate money with value, we tend to think of
innovators as inherently more valuable to our society as everyone else.

Clearly, there are reasons why we favor innovation, and I don't oppose
them. What I do oppose is the glorification of innovation, and treating
it as more important than other components of a meaningful society. Why
we need to stop

There are dangers to prioritizing innovation above all else, and it's
important to point them out.

We've trained multiple generations of people to believe that their best
bet for a career is to invent something new, to create an idea, or to
start their own business. Yet this can be destructive, considering the
high failure rate of startups. Entrepreneurs and idea generators who
don't have much experience may spend their whole lives trying to come up
with a billion-dollar idea, only to fail in the process (since
billion-dollar or even million-dollar ideas are so rare).

As if that weren't enough, we also have generations of people who look
down on jobs that don't require creativity or innovation. As a result,
we have a massive shortage of employees in skilled trades, and a lack of
people available to handle some very necessary tasks.

On a related note, our obsession with innovation leads us to devalue or
deprioritize maintenance, which is necessary to keep our world running.
It's far more appealing to invest money in a new tech startup that has
the potential to change the world than it is to invest in repairing a
bridge, or making upgrades to a highway system.

Of course, there are many reasons why our infrastructure is in poor
shape, but our prioritization of innovation rather than maintenance of
existing infrastructure plays a significant role in it.

Our relentless demand for innovation also encourages the development of
economic phenomena that don't always work in our favor. As an example,
consider planned obsolescence, the idea that tech companies specifically
design their products to expire or become less valuable upon the
emergence of a newer, better version of that product.

You could argue that this might happen no matter what; after all,
companies are expected to behave in a way that maximizes their own
interests, and selling new products is always better than simply
repairing old ones. However, it's our ongoing demand for new products
that allows this cycle to continue unabated.

In a similar vein, we're seeing the rollout of countless "inventions"
that are inferior copies of technologies that already exist, or
combinations of technologies that nobody asked for. Millions of
entrepreneurs are clamoring for our attention, and innovating merely for
innovations' sake, rather than taking their time developing truly
revolutionary technology. For example, how many apps have you seen to be
advertised as the "Uber for _____," rather than apps that, like Uber,
completely revolutionized some mundane or expensive task for consumers?

No matter where you fall on the political spectrum, chances are you
recognize that there's a problematic inequality issue that's only been
getting worse. The average CEO in the United States makes more in a
single day than the average worker makes in a year.

A person who invents an app that allows people to buy and sell services
may make billions of dollars, while the people buying and selling on the
platform struggle to make ends meet. Obviously, good ideas and hard work
deserve to be rewarded, but our lust for innovation is making this
discrepancy even more imbalanced; perhaps tempered expectations and a
fairer system could leave innovators making a hundred times what other
workers make, rather than three hundred times.

There are also some unforeseeable consequences to innovating in an area
we don't truly understand. For example, we've made massive progress in
developing technology that can detect cancer early; as a result, the
rate of cancer diagnosis has increased significantly, while the fatality
rate of cancer has remained more or less the same.

In other words, we're forcing consumers to spend more money and likely
be more stressed as the result of a diagnosis, without significantly
improving their chances of survival. This doesn't mean we should stifle
innovation, but it does mean we should progress more deliberately, and
with a better understanding of what we're releasing upon the world.

Fortunately, we're beginning to see progress in this area already, with
areas of research like CRISPR and gene editing facing heavy scrutiny
before being approved for wide-scale use. What to do instead

remote work

So what can we do instead of worshiping innovation? For starters, we can
pay more attention to the maintainers in our society, prioritizing
projects that keep us invested in the assets and devices we already
have. We can also temper our expectations when it comes to new gadgets
and breakthroughs, judiciously evaluating whether it's really worth
getting excited about whatever the latest new toy is.

I'm not saying we should abandon innovation-just that we should be
treating it with more respect and more patience. Otherwise, the problems
associated with glorifying innovation are only going to get worse.

Safe urban spaces for all shouldn't be a long haul

MINT

March 30, 2023 Thursday

Length: 621 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, March 30 -- Now and then, what's obvious needs to be
re-stated, lest it's pushed into the recesses of idle memory, where we
keep stuff we know but don't act upon. So, yes, democracy must be upheld
in spirit, not just as a structure, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi
reminded us this week. Also, hate speech will diminish if politics and
religion are kept apart, as the apex court observed. To this list, we
can add another truism. The participation of women in our paid workforce
would go up if everyone could count on clean toilets away from home.
Right now, India's gender gap in employment is abysmal. It is not as if
hygiene has escaped high-level attention. In pre-internet times, inland
letter cards would cite Mahatma Gandhi as saying cleanliness is next to
godliness. His actual take on this old adage was nuanced and
conditional. "Only when there is both inner and outer cleanliness," he
held, "it becomes next to godliness." Gandhi's observations may explain
why his spectacles were picked to symbolize Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a
high-profile campaign for sanitation flagged off by the Modi government
on 2 October 2014. Almost a decade later, this mission still has a long
way to go.

Swachh Bharat was begun on an impressive scale. Its mission-control
centre looked like a veritable war room, equipped with maps, stretch
targets and scoreboards being updated furiously. By official records,
over 100 million toilets were built across rural India within a span of
five years. And in 2019, just in time for Gandhi's 150th birth
anniversary, the country was declared "open defecation free" (ODF):
i.e., no village, district, state or Union territory was said to be left
that still had folks defecating outdoors. Absolute statements, of
course, are hard to defend because all it takes is one example to prove
it false. So we also had party-poopers who reported a return to open
fields once those latrines got clogged or over-soiled. Predictably,
sewage failures started showing up. No matter. The mission embarked on
Phase II, crafted to sustain behavioural shifts by focusing on waste
disposal, litter reduction and mop-ups of stagnant water. Today, of
India's 594,240 villages, 235,708 are proclaimed on its rural tracker as
having ticked its "ODF-plus" status checklist.

Swachh Bharat covers urban India too, with roughly similar aims and
guidelines. Yet, women still face not just an acute scarcity of public
urinal facilities in cities, but also a risk which does not show up on
official data charts: that of acquiring infections from unhygienic
lavatories. This is so even of private set-ups, big and small, and acts
as a cause of anxiety just about anywhere a woman may need to be (or
go). Women who cannot work from home and have less control of their time
schedules bear the brunt of it. The 'it' here is a broad neglect evident
in the poor upkeep of what little one can access for urination or a
menstrual-pad change. Be it transport hubs or field-work trips by road,
office spaces or institutional premises, what seems lost on male radars
can often be a red alert for women. For all the slogans that are reeled
out, this is a gap that must be closed for a better chance of closing
the one in paid employment, which is among the world's worst. While
complex reasons exist for it, clean washrooms would literally serve as a
hygiene factor, a welcome signal in settings that are mostly male-set.
We need a genuine focus on equity to prevail-and universally so. Setting
this right shouldn't be such a long haul.

From companies making kitchen robots to semi-automatic bike covers,
here's what SMBStory covered this week

SMBs are transforming and adopting technical solutions to solve consumer
problems. This week, SMBStory covered stories of entrepreneurs who are
integrating tech in their small and medium businesses.

India is seeing a tech revolution among small and medium businesses,
which are building brands around some interesting products solving major
consumer problems.

From a Delhi-based brand that makes semi-automatic bike covers to a
Bengaluru-based company that manufactures machines to make foods without
any human intervention, this week, SMBStory covered stories of tech
transforming SMBs.

Mukunda Foods

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has leveraged Indian businesses to
adopt the technology, accelerating the pace at which businesses,
especially SMBs, are digitising.

Bengaluru-based Mukunda Foods was founded in 2012 as a chain of
quick-service restaurants (QSR) to make and sell different kinds of
dosas. Automation was not even on the cards, recalls Eshwar K Vikas and
Sudeep Sawat, Co-founders of the company.

However, after opening their third outlet, they started facing issues
such as the staff not turning up or the chef taking too many leaves.
This impacted the quality and consistency of food, and led to an
increase in customer complaints, besides impacting the profits.

This is when the founders decided to leverage technology to automate
their kitchen processes. Because they had an engineering background, it
helped the founders to take care of the technicalities.

The company's first product - DosaMatic - was made for Mukunda's own
outlets, says Eshwar.

DosaMatic became famous in Bengaluru for "making dosas automatically."
As the orders grew day after day, the co-founders decided to transition
from the QSR business model to manufacturing and selling these machines.

Later, they innovated and made more machines (such as RiCo, Eco Fryer,
and Wokie) to automate other culinary dishes such as those of Chinese,
North Indian, American, and more cuisines.

Bike Blazer

Twenty-seven-year-old Keshav Rai was an average student in school but
his keen interest in repairing things around made him pursue
engineering. However, he soon got bored and decided to try his hands at
entrepreneurship.

Keshav was so serious about starting his own company that he requested
his father to fund one of his app-based businesses in 2015. But as they
say, timing is everything. Keshav's first two startups were failures,
but he never gave up on innovating and learning.

Having failed in the first two business attempts, Keshav left home, and
spent tough days before encountering the idea of starting a
semi-automatic bike cover business.

Keshav started Bike Blazer in late 2016. It offers two-wheeler parking
covers that are water-resistant and protects vehicles from dust. The
handy device can be fixed on the vehicle and the overall operational
time of the cover is below 30 seconds, says Keshav.

Today, Bike Blazer is seeing an annual turnover of Rs 1.3 crore.

Other top picks of the week:

Livpure

Rakesh Malhotra is the Founder of Luminous Batteries, a company he
launched in 1988 that started off by manufacturing and selling inverters
and batteries. It expanded to making air purifiers, water purifiers, and
more products after 2011 under the brand name Livpure.

But the year 2020 saw the serial entrepreneur's business journey change
direction - propelled by the usual suspect - the COVID-19 pandemic.

He had been observing the potential in the mattress market for quite
some time.

So, he decided to introduce two big changes in August 2020, right when
the country was coming out of the first nationwide lockdown. For
starters, the company took its products online after he realised that
during the pandemic, people were searching for Direct-to-Consumer (D2C)
brands for wellness products. And secondly, he introduced the sleep and
wellness vertical of Livpure, comprising mattresses, pillows, bedsheets,
curtains, etc.

While they started the mattress brand from scratch, today, it is scaling
up step by step, growing between 20-30 percent month on month, with an
average order value of Rs 12,000.

Read the full story here.

Theme Weavers Designs

India is known worldwide for its 'big fat weddings'. However, the
COVID-19 pandemic cast a massive shadow on the wedding industry.

A large number of people either postponed their wedding dates while
others decided to have smaller celebrations on their original dates and
a larger celebration at a later date. The trend may be new but Prerana
Agarwal Saxena, Founder of Theme Weavers Designs, a Gurugram-based
design studio that curates tailor-made weddings, says she saw it coming
in the last few years.

Prerana's love for palaces, forts, and luxury weddings made her quit
marketing to start her own wedding planning company. She says she began
by organising small birthday parties. Her first project was for Rs
5,000, and there has been no looking back since then.

Prerana organised her first wedding in 2009 at Rambagh Palace, Jaipur,
and has since planned around 106 weddings out of 250 events, including
those of Shivraj Singh, the Yuvraj of Jodhpur; Gayatri Kumari, Yuvrani
of Jodhpur; and more ranging in the premium budget.

Ruminating about the future of the Indian wedding industry amidst the
pandemic, Prerana says there won't be a huge change in the industry, but
it will continue to evolve.

"People now want premium and luxury weddings. The trend is fast changing
and wedding planners have to gear up for that," she says.

India's quest for global rankings

The Pioneer (India)

May 15, 2018 Tuesday

Copyright 2018 CMYK Printech Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 1200 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, May 15 -- Research credibility of Indian institutions is at its
lowest ebb. This is one of the reasons for the poor performance of
Indian universities globally. Overall, an attempt must be made to
improve the admission process and evaluate doctoral degrees

Every year when the Times Higher Education World University Rankings
list is released, people start cursing the Indian university set-up for
their failure to get into the global ranking list. But no one ever tries
to understand the reason behind the poor performance of our
universities.

Amongst the 13 performance indicators, research accounts for 30 per cent
of the total assessment criteria. There are three major heads under
which research is assessed - reputation survey; research income and
research productivity. The major reason for poor performance of our
higher education institutions is the assessment of research in our
universities. Ranking is done on data collected for the last five years
of the performance of universities. Every Government makes changes and
wants the ranking to be influenced immediately, which is not possible.

Do we trust our university research system, admission and awards? Ask
anyone in any of the academic institution or even the public and you
will get an answer for the poor performance of Indian institutions. In
most merit lists and awards, are made on the basis of region, caste,
religion and gender. This writer has himself been a part of various
committees to recommend the best reports or innovative experiments. The
committee invariably included names of people from the North-East,
members of the SC/ST community and also women so that the
recommendations look unbiased and inclusive. But the recommendations
itself do not remain a list of the best. It becomes a politically
correct list.

The nation and institutions have not done enough for the less-privileged
communities. Members of the less-privileged communities should have been
given extra academic support by organising classes and campuses so that
they come up to the mark and are just not included into the list because
we must have a member from the reserved community.

If admission to the doctoral degree programme is made on the basis of
considerations other than academic, how can universities ensure quality
output? Governments have interfered so much with the so-called
autonomous Indian institutions that they no more remain academic but
have become political battle-fields for different parties.

There are schemes to coach the less-privileged groups but not much has
changed. The schemes have become one more method to siphon public money.
Rigorous review of such schemes should be taken up and selected
meritorious students from the less-privileged groups should be given
best support to compete on an equal basis.

Any survey will reveal that we don't trust our doctoral thesis and
awards because we all now know the degrees are awarded on considerations
than merit. So, on the 18 per cent marks on Reputation Survey, our
universities would perform poorly, for sure. Not only foreign surveyors
but any survey within the country will reveal that we hold very poor
impression of our doctoral degrees.

University research, both science and social sciences, should contribute
to the existing corpus of human knowledge which is also one of the
criterion for ranking of universities. Our research output is not used
by the industry; and in most cases, the industry too does not pay for
conducting research to refine their processes. They hire agencies
outside the academia to give them suggestions.

Our universities cannot earn good marks on the scale of research
earning, an important criterion to assess research performance by
scholars who manage to get research funding are looked upon with
suspicion of squandering money so the administrative departments often
put roadblocks and it is also reported that researchers have to pay
bribe to get bills passed. We cannot brush aside these impressions and
expect research performance to improve. However, it must also be
mentioned that teachers of well supplied universities have misused the
provisions and used funding injudiciously.

Peer-review has been and is the pillar of academic excellence and
cornerstone of quality improvement in the best of institutions. However,
peer-review has lost credibility in our institutions. Academics of the
Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) are fighting to deprive the Vice
Chancellor of his right to nominate members to the selection committees.
It is apparent that departments have formed a national coterie and wish
to have only their friends as selection committee members - reasons all
know. Similar is the case with PhD thesis examiners. The panel of
examiners is often submitted by the supervisor and the list often
consists of the same names. A quick survey can be done by the University
Grants Commission (UGC).

Our social scientists are known to be ideologues of political outfits.
They will invariably take a stand and express views which will be
aligned to a political ideology. Scholars are known more as political
activists than as scholars and academics. The global academic community,
by and large, does not trust our academic contribution. That is the
reason why we are not quoted by other scholars (except our research
students and friends) either within the country or abroad. This is an
important pillar of academic research, and also of the the ranking.

We have decided on our own on a list of academic journals as Academic
Performance Indicators (API), which is not accepted by the world
ranking. Very few journals from India appear in the list of Elsevier's
Scopus list which is considered for rating research publication and
ranking. The introduction of API by the UGC did more damage to the
research and publication than good.

It is now common knowledge that journals hire writers to write for
academics on a payment so that teachers can accumulate API and compete
for teaching positions and also promotions. There have been scores of
complaints by educators against teachers at the JNU of plagiarising
their doctoral thesis and also publications. Action is delayed and often
no action is taken. Plagiarism is the highest form of crime in academia
and there should neither be leniency nor any delay in action. This sends
a wrong message and breaks the morale of true researchers.

As an immediate measure, the UGC should constitute a committee of
scholars who have worked in this area and ask for recommendations to
subvert the existing practice. Research funding to universities should
be linked to research performance. Admission process and evaluation of
doctoral degrees should be made more rigorous so that quality improves
and scholars and stakeholders trust the degrees awarded by universities.
Research credibility of our institutions is at its lowest ebb. We must

Entrepreneurship 101 is a series that focuses on the 'human' aspects of
being an entrepreneur. Through this series, YourStory shares ideas,
suggestions, references, and examples that will help you reflect and
tread the entrepreneurial path smoothly.

American businessman Stephen R Covey said, "Accountability breeds
response-ability." And entrepreneurship demands accountability.

Accountability can be termed as the secret sauce for building a
successful venture. It helps set clear expectations, creating a culture
of following through one's commitments, and ultimately, achieving
success. It is really the tool that keeps an entrepreneur and his team
focused on the end goal.

To be accountable means to claim responsibility for one's actions and
consequences.

While one may argue that an entrepreneur is responsible for the success
or failure of their company, accountability, if established at all
levels, has the power to decentralise responsibility, create more
autonomy, and lead to a comparatively smoother path to success.

Setting tailored, achievable goals for each individual working in a
startup helps the organisation move a step closer to success.

While building a new product or starting a new venture, one must focus
on accountability and quality. Similarly, accountability towards one's
clients, customers, and even investors are crucial to establishing a
sense of trust and confidence.

Manish Rathi, Co-founder and CEO of smart bus booking platform IntrCity,
says, "It all starts with hiringOne must hire the right people who
appreciate the value of performance and the importance of their role in
the organisation."

For this article on Entrepreneurship 101, we focus on how founders can
instil accountability within their startups.

How to ensure accountability?

YourStory asked entrepreneurs about their experiences and suggestions on
how to instil accountability in a startup. Here's what they had to say:

Leading by example

The most simple yet crucial way to improve workplace accountability is
by holding oneself accountable first. Entrepreneurs should set the
standards for the rest of the team.

Subodh Parulekar, Co-founder and CEO of AFour Technologies, says,
"Apathetic people are quick to point the finger at someone else or defer
by saying, 'It's not my job.' Leaders must send the message and show by
example that delivering quality solutions are important across all
levels."

Achievable goals over lofty dreams

While expecting team members to give their 100 percent at work, it is
essential to set boundaries as well. As a founder and leader, you must
set clear and achievable goals for your team. When everyone understands
their respective responsibilities, it becomes easier to hold them
accountable.

Each member in every team must be aware of what is expected from them.
This, however, doesn't end with just assigning work. Leaders should
always instil in their team the cruciality of these responsibilities,
and the repercussions of not meeting them. "This will automatically
juggle the psychology of the employee, making them realise their
significance, and further making them feel accountable for their actions
and responsibilities," says Mandeep Manocha, Co-founder and CEO of
Cashify.

Naman Shah, Founder and CEO of NowPurchase, adds that when working with
different tasks and projects, he asks the project owner to scope out the
deliverable themselves instead of their manager or team lead. "There is
a significant increase in accountability when the project timeline is
driven by the project owner rather than someone who is delegating that
project," he says.

According to Alan Mulally, former President and CEO of Ford Motor
Company, "When people feel accountable and included, it is more fun."

Mandeep agrees and adds, "Defining specific, measurable, achievable,
relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for every employee will give them
a purpose. And, this purpose will encourage them to be accountable and
responsible towards fulfilling these goals."

Be transparent

It is essential to be genuine and transparent with one's team. Founders
should share their stories of failures and how they can do better with
their team. This will not only create a culture of openness but also
influence other team members to be accountable. This, entrepreneurs must
ensure, should be followed at all levels and across teams. That is, each
layer of the hierarchy must be aware of the objectives of their higher
and lower levels.

Sometimes people who work in smaller projects do not understand how
their work is related to the larger goal of the company. Therefore, it
is essential to be transparent about the roles and responsibilities at
all levels.

Measure the impact

Once the goals are set, it is equally essential to measure the impact of
each employees' contribution. Measuring the impact allows employees to
figure out where they went wrong, how they can improve and go forward,
and how they can streamline their work to reach the set goals.

Furthermore, the measurement will ensure that employees meet their
assigned targets and remain accountable in the long run.

Frequent constructive feedback

"To err is human. You fall only to get up and start again. Failures and
mistakes teach you lessons that no other teacher can," says Mandeep.

Criticism, when constructive, is important for the betterment of
individuals and the team. Whether they are words of encouragement or
constructive criticism, entrepreneurs should deliver feedback
consistently, and in clear, unambiguous sentences. This will not only
ensure that the team members are not taken aback by sudden disappointing
feedback, but will also help in the improvement of processes.

Similarly, people need to be encouraged when they are doing a good job.
Entrepreneurs must recognise and celebrate the progress of individuals.
Words of motivation help create a sense of responsibility within
individuals, and motivates others to follow the same. Celebrating
milestones help teams remain motivated to do better, and as a result,
makes them more accountable.

How are startups instilling accountability?

We asked startups about the different mechanisms they have in place in
their respective startups to ensure accountability at all levels. Here's
what they said worked for their companies:

Open work environment

At Celcius, the team follows an open-work environment. This provides
employees with the freedom to grow, and take ownership and
responsibility for their work. The workplace acts as a support system
for the employees, giving them the space to learn and thrive while
holding themselves accountable and responsible for driving growth.

Despite having software-based checks and balances in place, the founders
figured that providing employees with the freedom to work at their pace
and divide their time based on their workload, has proven to be the most
effective in instilling the value of accountability and thereby,
contributed massively to the growth of the company.

When employees view themselves as drivers of development in the company,
they become accustomed to performing diligently.

Furthermore, open delegation of tasks also helps facilitate transparency
for everyone in the organisation, making sure roles and responsibilities
are clear. While measuring the success of a particular task, founders
can then easily assess who should be held accountable for what part of
the process.

IntrCity has implemented a similar mechanism to ensure smooth
functioning.

One function per individual

Too many cooks spoil the broth. Similarly, too many people assigned for
one job will only lead to chaos and inefficiency.

Therefore, it is essential to assign one individual accountable for a
function or task, instead of having multiple people or teams take
accountability for it. At NowPurchase, project owners and stakeholders
are given the authority and autonomy to determine their own deliverables
and timelines. Having sprint mechanisms, OKRs on a common platform where
anyone can see which projects are being worked on and by whom and their
timelines instil accountability among the employees.

At Celcius, performance reviews of the top leadership - COO, CFO, and
CEO - are also conducted. During this, employees provide their feedback
on their experiences with the leaders as well.

Avoid micromanaging

At Cashify, the founders are dead against micromanaging. Mandeep says
that entrepreneurs should trust their employees and the team that they
have built. Additionally, founders should empower the team to take
ownership of tasks and make decisions.

"This might feel uncomfortable to them but eventually, you will notice
that they're beaming with accountability towards the responsibilities
they have been bestowed with," he adds.

Communication is the key

At Cashify, Naman formally communicates expectations to the pertinent
individuals and has regular touchpoints to provide feedback. Every
alternate day, Naman arranges team standups where everyone talks about
what they are working on, where they are blocked and how they plan to
execute it.

"This creates a first-level of understanding of what is going on, and
this mechanism aids in keeping the timeline on track," he adds.

Similarly, at Celcius, the senior leadership meets twice a month to
gauge the performances of their respective departments. They hold each
other accountable for their department's performances and prospects of
improvements in the future.

Summing up

According to Courtney Lynch, author of Spark: How to lead yourself and
others to greater success, "Leaders inspire accountability through their
ability to accept responsibility before they place blame."

Many entrepreneurs forget they are the role model for accountability and
do not evaluate their activities to ensure they consistently practice
what they preach. Therefore, it is essential for entrepreneurs to hold
themselves accountable before expecting accountability from their
employees.

Leading by example, building transparency, and demonstrating how one's
goals are tied to the success of the company are effective ways in which
entrepreneurs can ensure that their employees know they are accountable.

About Lambert Strether

Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic
cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs
that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working
class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college
and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs
Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor
conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two
are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much
care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one
does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be
a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and
collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the
benefits are delivered.To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare
for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess
'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other
recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the
very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of
suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics —
even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's
wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration
with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of
two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and
the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in
the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters
that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind
of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in
life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very
hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments
will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I
have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates
opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts
markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back
into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and
secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it
daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at
the back of it.

OLX Group-backed CarFirst has shut down in Pakistan. Here's why

Pakistan Today

August 22, 2022 Monday

Copyright 2022 Nawa Media (Pvt.) Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Section: Vol. 33; No. 229

Length: 1975 words

Body

After more than five years in operations, the OLX backed car trading
platform CarFirst found itself out of business not with a bang but with
a whimper. A simple announcement on LinkedIN marked CarFirst shuttering
its operations on the heels of its competitor VavaCars announcing they
were calling it quits in June this year.

Both companies had a very similar business model. So when VavaCars shut
down earlier in the year, questions about the fate of CarFirst had
already started making the rounds. The story sounds similar to so many
other startups in Pakistan in the past few months. Funding has dried up
as the result of the global recession and the US Fed raising interest
rates, and CarFirst is just the latest victim. As investors' sentiment
is fueled by fear because of the economic downturn, they are chasing
sustainable business models - ones that do not require continuous cash
burn.

Remember, however, that this isn't any old startup. Their failure is a
little more complicated and points towards larger problems. CarFirst was
funded by Dutch-domiciled global classifieds giant the OLX Group, and is
part of the OLX Autos universe which deals in the business of buying and
selling of used cars, beyond the classifieds only business and has no
shortage of financial heft to back its portfolio companies. And when
companies like OLX back out from funding their own portfolio companies,
it could hint at very serious challenges in the market. And for tech
companies, it means that funding woes can haunt you even if you are
backed by the best in business.

Earlier, OLX Mall, the eCommerce division of OLX in Pakistan, was shut
down in March. OLX backing out from investing even after spending
millions on building the brand and just before the launch is courageous.
But OLX seems to have been cautious with where it invests and continues
to invest because of a funding crunch as well its own woes: the
Dutch-listed Prosus, which owns OLX Group, is in distress because of the
Russian invasion of Ukraine which has impacted one of its prized
portfolio companies Avito, the Russian equivalent of OLX, now up for
sale.

So how does all this add up for CarFirst? Briefly, rising food and fuel
inflation have brought down purchasing power, the increase in dollar has
resulted in an increase in car prices and the overall production of new
cars has slowed down. Add to that equation the import ban which was
lifted only a day ago, and you have a recipe for disaster for a sector
such as autos. While there is no data on the size of the used cars
market in Pakistan, versions from used cars dealers gives a desolatory
picture of the used cars business as well and CarFirst operated as a
trader of used cars.

CarFirst and OLX

Article continues after this advertisement

CarFirst proudly identified itself as an OLX Group company while it was
operational. Founded in 2016, the company operated a website and a
network of inspection centres and warehouses for inspecting, buying and
selling of cars.

The company raised its Series-A investment from Germany-based Frontier
Car Group (FCG) but never went public about it. According to Crunchbase
data, CarFirst raised $89 million from FCG in 2018, which would safely
make it the largest Series-A investment raised by a startup in Pakistan.
CarFirst subsequently raised Series B investment directly from OLX Group
as well, also in 2018 according to media reports.

Berlin-based Frontier Car Group which funded CarFirst also operated in
the used cars space and developed, launched and operated used cars
marketplaces in emerging markets such as Nigeria, Chile, Mexico,
Pakistan and Indonesia. In November 2019, OLX Group invested $400
million in FCG and became its largest, though not a majority
shareholder.

In 2020, the OLX Group acquired a controlling stake in Frontier Car
Group and the same year, OLX and FCG partnered to create OLX Autos, into
which it has now folded Frontier Car Group operations. OLX Autos
operates as a trader of used cars, giving evaluations and buying cars to
sell them at a margin.

OLX Autos operates in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, India,
Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru under the same brand name, and operates
three independent brands in other other geographies: CarFirst in
Pakistan, Car45 in Nigeria and webuyanycar.com in the US.

Since its partnership with Frontier Car Group which initially began with
a relatively smaller investment in 2018, OLX now controls 99% effective
interest in Frontier Car Group. OLX also shut down FCG's Berlin office
last year where it was based.

While how much of CarFirst is owned by OLX is not known to us, a source
at OLX in Pakistan told Profit that OLX Autos in Pakistan was CarFirst,
which means that OLX effectively controlled CarFirst in Pakistan. OLX,
which lists classifieds including autos on its website, has been an
active partner of CarFirst, holding events such as CarBazaar and setting
up auto inspection centres together.

The business of used cars in Pakistan

Even if OLX did not fully control CarFirst, a drying up of global VC
funding means that CarFirst had no other funding options while OLX would
also not be willing to give follow-on funds because of the cash burning
model of the CarFirst business.

You see, CarFirst operates a network of brick-and-mortar inspection
centres which means it would have incurred high CAPEX, as well as high
OPEX to keep those centres operational. The way it worked with CarFirst
was that sellers could go to a nearby CarFirst centre, get an inspection
and a price on the car and if the price sounded reasonable, CarFirst
would buy that car from the seller at the agreed price.

CarFirst would then apply any fixes to the car and sell it to a buyer at
a higher price, earning revenue from the difference in the purchase and
sale price of the car. All this while, CarFirst had competitors as well
which included the traditional used cars dealers as well as classifieds
platforms OLX itself and PakWheels.

If one thinks about a Pakistani auto seller or a buyer, the behaviour
usually is that the consumer would hop on to options that would offer
the best price. If CarFirst offered a price on a car, the seller would
most likely check out traditional used cars dealers and place ads on
PakWheels and then negotiate with buyers just to get the right price,
overlooking the convenience of selling on CarFirst that comes with
certified inspection reports based on which they priced there cars. Then
a similar competitor, VavaCars also appeared in the foray making the
competition more intense for CarFirst.

However, in conversation with automotive dealers across Lahore Defence's
Main Boulevard, Profit discovered that whether or not end users were
getting the prices they wanted to sell their cars to CarFirst, dealers
were. Many dealers cited the convenience of using CarFirst, and how they
could readily sell to them at rates that made profits for them.

Now this juxtaposition between end-customers possibly not using the
platform enough to dealers being fans of it is interesting. It would
indeed be correct if someone might cite that CarFirst was eliminating
its competition by purchasing stock from dealers. However, by purchasing
used vehicles from dealers at rates profitable to them and then selling
the same vehicle to customers reduces your own profit margins.
Increasing your profit margin would have come via higher prices for
end-customers which kind of defeats the purpose of the customer being in
the used automotive market to begin with.

In short, growth in the Pakistani market for these newage used cars
dealers is questionable. Think of it another way: companies like
CarFirst and VavaCars were trying to become a national franchise when no
other traditional used car dealer could achieve the same. Furthermore,
in conversation with the dealers, Profit realised that none of them
really wanted to go beyond their regional markets to begin with. At best
they thought of city-wide hegemony, but that too as a pipe-line project.

CarFirst and VavaCars tried to do something ambitious that frankly
no-one else even wanted to, simply because of the heterogeneous nature
of markets and customers across Pakistan. We term it valiant but the
dealers whom we conversed with termed their fallen rivals' ambitions as
being disconnected from ground realities about the market..

But the final nail in the coffin for CarFirst was perhaps the economy.
Pakistan is currently going through macroeconomic hell, with fuel prices
sky-high and inflation clocking in at 24.9% last month. At a time when
customer purchasing power is at an extreme low, the market for cars,
used and old, is suffering from the government's wonky balance of
payments policies.

In May the Government imposed an import ban on completely-built-up (CBU)
vehicles and increased the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) oversight on
the import of completely-knocked-down (CKD) kits. The government set the
automotive industry a whirlwind of price increases following these
measures.

Starting off the CBU units, the government rescinded the ban on CBU
earlier this month on the eve of the 3-month anniversary of the ban
itself. However, this blanket ban on CBUs led to prices for CBU units to
skyrocket. There are two types of customers in the used CBU market, the
ones that want a bargain and the ones that want reconditioned
Landcruiser and/or Prado-esque vehicles. The ban nearly eliminated the
former from the used car market and limited the number of those that
fall in the latter.

Now CKD units constitute the majority of the car market in Pakistan to
begin with. The SBP's measures also came at a time when the PKR
nosedived. This led to automotive manufacturers to engage in price
increases. Rounds of them.

Profit looked at the prices of some of the more popular vehicles in the
market space to see how much their price had increased over the summer.

Average Price in May Average Price Now Difference Increase

Alto PKR 1,719,667 PKR 1,966,000 PKR 246,333 14.32%

City PKR 3,574,000 PKR 4,117,000 PKR 543,000 15.19%

Corolla PKR 4,462,333 PKR 5,227,333 PKR 765,000 17.14%

Sportage PKR 5,800,000 PKR 6,750,000 PKR 950,000 16.38%

The prices of refurbished vehicles is also closely tied to that of brand
new ones. The price increases by automotive manufacturers had ripple
effects on the refurbished vehicle market as well.

Profit talked to used cars dealers across Lahore's Defence Main
Boulevard with most of them reporting that they had seen a reduction in
trading volume because customers preferred to wait and see where the
prices would stabilise.

'There are three kinds of cars sold at dealerships; brand new, used, and
imported. Sales of all of them have reduced since the rupee depreciated
so steeply,' Haji Muhammad Shahzad, chairman of All Pakistan Motor
Dealers Association (APMDA), told Profit. 'They gave many of our members
good competition but so did we.'

You see for a company like CarFirst which operates brick-and-mortar
centres, the costs are high but a decrease in the volume of trade of
used cars overall in the economy means that CarFirst would not be able
to grow customers as well as revenue, and would not be able to keep
incurring expenses without funding from the investors which has gone
scarce overnight especially for markets like Pakistan.

Earlier, VavaCars, which was also backed by a multi-billion dollar
energy group Vitol decided to wrap up operations despite having the
financial heft to continue. A source at VavaCars told Profit that in the
case of VavaCars, the company could not grow substantially. It could be
a similar case for CarFirst.

The official from CarFirst maintained that the Pakistani market was good
for their business but did not take specific questions from Profit about
CarFirst's operations. The OLX Group, on the other hand, has not
responded to our request for comments.

The age of entrepreneurs - companies may fail but entrepreneurs never do

An indefatigable spirit and a never-say-die attitude is what sets apart
a successful entrepreneur from the also-rans. A seasoned entrepreneur is
one who is not dissuaded by failures and does not get complacent with a
one-off success.

Becoming an entrepreneur is never easy. Although newspapers and business
channels today are filled with news of billionaires and unicorn company
founders making unimaginable amounts of money, the story behind,
although often heard, cannot be understood until experienced.

The internet is rife with stories of failures from the lives of Bill
Gates to Jack Ma, yet their legacy lives on. This is because the path to
entrepreneurial success is not easy. So, what is that makes the aura of
these people so vast, much beyond the scope of the products they helped
create? The answer lies in something elusive called the 'startup
spirit.'

The road to entrepreneurship

Thanks to cushy white collared jobs and small businesses that are
earning enough for existence and a little bit for indulgence, comfort of
a familiar lifestyle cocoons us easily. Only entrepreneurs, with their
desire, can break free from the invisible shackles. Their will to create
something new instills a sense of discipline and long-term vision that
distinguishes an entrepreneur.

Surely, many failures come along the way, probably more than successes,
but entrepreneurs never shy away from situations they perceive as
opportunities. They continue to persevere knowing full well that one of
their ventures will eventually hit the bull's eye.

Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn had already founded six other
brands, including the visionary SocialNet.com, before finally striking
gold with the professional social network. The amount of adulation that
his product received guaranteed his presence in the tech entrepreneurial
Hall of Fame and he is now considered one of the finest investors of all
time as well.

Down but not out

Although the existence of successful startups is important in an
entrepreneur's portfolio, the presence of failed startups is significant
and sometimes necessary in order to provide an essential grounding,
maturity and practicality to an otherwise excited and quick-to-react
individual.

The importance of failed startups also ensures an entrepreneur does not
gauge her/his abilities from the success of a single startup as there
are a variety of factors at play. It is said that from the ages of
22-36, prospective entrepreneurs should have at least some experience at
handling unsuccessful business attempts to develop the priceless ability
of starting from scratch.

Success sustained

After the throne has been ascended, the confetti showers done with and
the last guests have meandered back with a bellyful of food and 'high
spirits', the entrepreneur sits and ponders. It is not the time to
relax, but to put in intense action and redouble the efforts.

Complacency never finds a place in the arsenal of an entrepreneur, for
his fight is not with anyone else, but his own mind and his own
ambitions. New ideas, products, campaigns, growth, and markets swarm
around an entrepreneur's dream and continue to prick like sand in the
eye. It is not out of greed, but out of a compulsion to create that an
entrepreneur functions.

This gives him the liberty to be eccentric in words and deeds because
his mind sees the potential of building bridges where others only see
vast rivers.

The current situation is extremely favourable to foster the growth of
businesses, as can be seen with the huge number of entrepreneurial
talents developing across the country. The current Indian government is
running a plethora of schemes and initiatives to promote skill-building
as well as providing resources and a strong business framework that
facilitates new businesses to develop and survive.

Furthermore, the development of the internet and digital businesses have
created a level playing field, and young entrepreneurs are now competing
with established players in a territory both of them are trying to learn
the tricks of.

In the end, it is essential for an entrepreneur to develop an outsider's
perspective and not be too affected by the success or failure of
startups. It is necessary to not use the achievements of one's startup
as the barometer of one's own abilities. The important thing is to not
stop even after failures or successes and keep striving to achieve
innovation, efficiency, and perfection in every endeavour and stay true
to your entrepreneurial spirit.

YourStory UNCUT: How Theka Coffee went from shutting shop to partnering
with Reliance

YourStory UNCUT aims to explore the biggest challenges and failures
startups and entrepreneurs have faced in their journeys. This week,
Bhupinder Madaan of Theka Coffee talks about the roadblocks he
encountered.

Rome was not built in a day. And neither was Amazon.

A global force today, the tech giant's founder Jeff Bezos did not have
an easy journey - facing several challenges and dealing with failures
worth "billions of dollars" - before making it big.

Closer home, Dhirubhai Ambani, Ratan Tata, and NR Narayan Murthy, among
others also faced several failures before becoming inspiring success
stories.

While their success stories are widely known, it is also important to
understand that they didn't happen overnight. And the same applies to
the famed entrepreneurs of today, who had to overcome many roadblocks to
reach where they are.

YourStory UNCUT is a series of interviews where entrepreneurs reveal the
biggest challenges and failures they have faced in their journey so far.

In our first episode, YourStory spoke to Bhupinder Madaan, Founder of
Theka Coffee

Juggling between businesses

Hearing his life story, it is clear that Bhupinder always had the mind
of an entrepreneur. He was only 14-years-old when he first made money.
After school, the Ahmedabad boy would sell pamphlets for shopkeepers and
other businessmen, for two hours, and make Rs 200 every day.

"Once you get into the mindset of wanting to make money, there is no
going back. The moment you see a gap in the market, you start making a
business out of it," Bhupinder tells YourStory.

Later, while he was in Class 11-12, he enrolled as an external student
in his school. That is, he did not have the compulsion to attend and
would only go to school to appear for his exams.

While visiting his other house in Delhi, Bhupinder spotted momo thelas
or stalls in every nook and corner of the city. Ahmedabad, however, was
yet to get the hype. Spotting a gap there, he started a momo stall in
the city when he was only 15-years-old. In a span of two years, he had
three.

Then, he was also approached by a company canteen's committee to
introduce North Indian food, which led him to launch 'Happy Hours',
offering parathas for breakfast.

He simultaneously ran these two businesses, earning between Rs 3,000 and
4,000, per day. Later, he dropped out of college. Besides financial
constraints at home, Bhupinder felt he was only, "Wasting my time
studying; I made up my mind to never work for anyone," he adds.

He then started freelancing for an IT company on the business
development side. He also worked with an app development company. "These
two experiences made me realise that I was a good salesperson,"
Bhupinder says.

Bhupinder Madaan, Founder of Theka Coffee

The rise of Theka

In January 2017, Bhupinder decided to quit everything else to focus on
researching the food and beverage industry. This was, however, not by
chance. A chance visit to a bar in Delhi gave Bhupinder the idea of
selling coffee in a beer bottle.

Like most millennials, he was drawn to the premium coffees served at the
likes of Starbucks, Cafe Coffee Day, and Barista. However, like most
middle-class Indians, Bhupinder was unable to afford premium coffee on a
regular basis.

Thus, the idea of Theka Coffee was born - freshly brewed 100 percent
Arabic coffee served in a beer bottle and priced at Rs 100.

Bhupinder started Theka in September 2017 by selling coffee on the
streets. He would park his car in the Sindhubhavan Marg in Ahmedabad and
sell coffee to customers passing by.

Theka roasted, brewed, and served three variants of coffee - Palangtod
or the strong and dark roasted coffee, Next level or the medium-roasted
coffee, and finally, Coffee ki Jawani or the light-roasted coffee.

Source: Theka Coffee

Besides these basic coffees, Theka has nine other flavoured coffees:
Pataka Popcorn, Desi Santra, Minto Rani, Nut-Khatt, Chocolatey Patola,
Berry Pia, Angrezi Tharra, Kala Gora, and Chota Bomb. The brand's USP
lies in selling "freshly brewed premium coffee at an affordable price".

Gradually, over the next two and a half years, Bhupinder adopted the
franchise model and opened 14 Theka cafes in high streets and malls of
not just Ahmedabad but also in Pune, Jaipur, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Bhuj,
Baroda, and Anand.

Across these outlets, he claims that he was doing about Rs 3 lakh of
business every month.

And the fall

Excited to keep the business growing, Bhupinder overlooked high capital
and operational expenditure associated with opening cafes on high
streets. High rentals, cash burn, and the ultimate threat - the COVID-19
pandemic - proved fatal for Theka.

"The initial months of lockdown meant zero business but I had to keep
paying Rs 1.25 lakh of rent for our spaces in the malls I had burnt all
my savings and had to sell my car as well," recalls Bhupinder.

As a result, Theka had to shut shop.

By June 2020, all 14 outlets of Theka had to be shut down due to a lack
of business and operational capital. To top it all off, Bhupinder's
mentor, co-founder, and partner decided to quit the business at a time
when the startup was in the middle of debt.

Business rebooted

Despite the business going to an absolute standstill, Bhupinder kept
going. "I never gave up on the brand. I did not know if it would ever
work again but I kept doing what I had to do without holding any
regrets," he says.

After the first wave of the pandemic subsided a little, he started from
scratch. He bought a cart and parked it in Sindhubhavan Marg, the origin
of Theka, to restart the business. "On the first day, I sold about seven
bottles of coffee," he recalls.

Subsequently, with the rise and fall of the different COVID-19 waves,
the business was doing less than average. After three months, the number
rose and Bhupinder sold coffee worth Rs 2,000-3,000, daily.

Having learnt from his past mistakes, he decided to not invest much
capital and decided to expand the business organically. Bhupinder placed
four thelas or carts in four different locations in Ahmedabad to further
grow his coffee chain.

The fame

Fast forward to January 2022, Bhupinder got shortlisted to pitch Theka
on the Indian television show Shark Tank. While he did not manage to get
the investment, he gained much more from the fame.

Today, Theka records an average sales worth Rs 15,000 from every outlet,
every day. Furthermore, the coffee startup recently raised Rs 2.5 crore
in a round led by a Dubai-based VC firm Zenith Multi Trading.

More interestingly, ever since the episode of Shark Tank was aired,
Bhupinder has been receiving collaboration opportunities with other
companies as well. Recently, Microsoft asked Theka to operate a cart
from the company's office campus in Bengaluru.

Reliance approached him with a business tie-up. The entrepreneur has
decided to go ahead with the latter and going ahead, Theka will be
launching and operating its carts inside 10 Reliance retail stores in
Mumbai.

Speaking of future plans, Bhupinder says he wants to take Theka
pan-India. By next month, the entrepreneur has plans to launch Theka
carts across Kolkata, Pune, Gurugram, Surat, and Chattisgarh, among
other Indian cities.

"The enthusiasm to keep going, and the emotional strength to deal with
failures was built in me because I started out early. I would love to
repeat this journeyeven if I were offered Rs 100 crore at 14 years of
age, I would still choose this over the money," Bhupinder signs off.

After Essential's failure, OSOM plans a new privacy-first handset

December 28 -- Last year's Essential implosion marked one of the most
high-profile consumer electronics startup failures in recent memory.
Launched in 2017 with $330 million, a killer pedigree and some truly
grand ambitions, the company sputtered through a combination of industry
issues, disappointment and troubling allegations against founder Andy
Rubin.

The brand was eventually purchased by Carl Pei for his new company. But
the executive eventually bucked the name in favor of "Nothing."
"[B]efore we were called Nothing, 'Essential' was one of the names we
were brainstorming, internally," he told me earlier this year "So that's
why we've acquired the trademark. We don't have any plans to do anything
with Essential."

Something far closer to a spiritual successor arrives in the form of
OSOM. The company, founded by ex-Essential employees, has had a
smattering of press coverage over the past several months, but has
largely kept quiet. Today, however, the Cupertino, California-based firm
confirmed what many long suspected: OSOM (pronounced "awesome") is
working on a phone.

 

Its planned OV1 device is, at least aesthetically, very clearly the work
of the same team that gave the world the Essential PH1. But rather than
features like modularity, the product is designed with one core thing in
mind: Privacy. Specifically, it's designed to give users greater control
over data privacy.

Beyond that, details are scarce, ahead of its planned MWC 2022 launch.
We sat down with co-founder and CEO Jason Keats for more information on
OSOM and its upcoming handset.

TC: We're about two months out from the announcement?

JK: Yeah, we're a couple of months out from sharing the fine details.
We're planning the give the full announcement at MWC, and then shipping
summer 2022. Right now we're ready to announce that we are building a
phone. People are really excited. We wanted to give our fans something
this year, and we're coming in under the wire.

What constitutes a fan at this point, given that the company has been
under lock and key?

It's been really surprising. Essential fans were very, very supportive
early on, and they've continued to be supportive and excited about what
we're building for the future. I think we're going to pick up quite a
few traditional Android fans. Right now there aren't a lot of flagship
phones outside of Pixel that are vanilla Android. We're going to
continue that, and we've already built and are continuing to refine some
privacy-centric software.

How many of the existing team have come over from Essential?

When we built PH1 at Essential, we were maybe 30 people total. We have
maybe 15 people from that team. It's really the core group of people;
design, engineer, product design and software engineering.

How large is the team in total?

Around 30 people [...] We're more than two-thirds engineering.

How did you begin the process of building up one company from,
effectively, the ashes of another?

For all of the shortcomings and incidences that happened at Essential,
one thing that I will praise [Rubin] forever for is his ability to
recruit. He brought on some incredible talent. When he told me that the
company was going under, I said, what I am going to do next? I don't
want to work for Google or Apple or go to Amazon, but there's this
incredible team there that has built stuff and worked together so
closely. It's been through the trenches together[...]

We realized that probably the biggest issue [with Essential] was a lack
of focus. We realized we needed to have a purpose. What are we trying to
solve for? It became obvious to us that privacy really wasn't being
addressed coherently, particularly in 2020.

Does the world need another phone company?

Yes, absolutely I think they do. One that's actually focused on
protecting privacy. And there's a big reason for that. If we were just a
software company building privacy software, we could trhow it on the
Play Store, people could install it, whatever. But if it's just an app
sitting on someone's phone, it's easily bypassed, it's easily turned
off, because it's not built into the system. It's not integrated into
the device. That's what we're doing. Because we're an OEM, because we
have access to Qualcomm's TrustZone, because we have access to the
system software, we can build some real privacy-centric software that
the user can use or not use, if they chose. But it's all about giving
them a choice.

How difficult will it be to get someone to jump over to this phone with
privacy as a main selling point?

In the U.S., I'm not trying to go after Apple users. We're going after
Android users. And in that scenario, there isn't a tremendous amount of
brand loyalty within the Android space. People are willing to take a lot
more shots. For privacy, we've already lined up quite a few partners
that have shared some high-level demgraphic data about who is using
their software or hardware for privacy. The numbers are astonishing to
us. They really indicate that there is a demand for privacy and that
people are currently spending their money today on privacy.

What's a realistic expectation in terms of units? You're casting a wide
net [to the U.S., Canada and throughout Europe]. It seems ultimately the
Essential numbers weren't what people were hoping for.

It's funny. When we started Essential, the goal was 100,000 units in the
first year. We sold just shy of 300,000 units to end users the first
year. The biggest issue is because [Rubin] raised so much money, the
expectation was to ship two million units. When you go into expecting
100,000 units and sell 300,000 units, that's a huge success. It all
depends on what metric you're using. For [OSOM], I would be absolutely
thrilled with 200,000 units in the first year. We would be here for a
very, very long time.

Were the external expectations so intense as to cause things to fall
apart [at Essential]?

I can fill up a book on what went wrong. And there were a bunch of
little things.

Give me the CliffsNotes.

Some decisions made at the very top were counterintuitive to us being
successful.

On the note of capital, it was reported that the company raised $5.6
million. What has the fundraising been so far.

So, we secured $20 million. Some of it investor, and a chunk of it was
pre-order from a channel partner. We've already got orders that are
close to the number that we can support in the first year. We did have
the bulk of our investors come from myself and my co-founder Wolfgang
and our external VCs were all primarily Canadian companies.

Has there been a Series A on top of the initial seed funding?

We are currently in the middle of a Series A.

Was Playground involved?

No. We had a nice long chat with them. The team over there - Bruce, Matt
and Peter - are still very good friends. I still use them as sounding
boards for ideas.

When was the company officially launched?

The articles of incorporation were officially filed on 4 20 2020.

The name is pronounced "awesome?" Which was first, the name or the
acronym?

Twenty minutes after [Rubin] told me that Essential was going under, I'm
like, "Alright, I'm gonna do my own thing." I hate stuff that's super
overt. I hate all the wires and plugs and this and that all over your
house, and it drives me nuts. And I had this idea for a different
product, which we may or may not eventually build. It has nothing to do
with the phone, but just some crazy idea. But the idea was out of sight,
out of mind. I think what the people, what the average consumer really
pictures when we talk about the future technology in Star Trek, and the
sense of speaking and something answers out of the ether. It's not a
thing sitting on my desk that has a cable that's nine feet long, but
it's only eight inches from the wall. The idea was this thing that comes
out of ether, and the idea was "out of sight out of mind. Oh, OSOM,
we'll just call it awesome." I registered it from the hotel in Hong
Kong.

Any of those initial ideas being applied here? Obviously, privacy is the
thing.

That's certainly the mentality, because of the way we're building our
software. The idea is that, again, it maintains an out of sight, out of
mind; you should just trust that your devices are keeping you safe when
you want to be safe.

For the time being it's an American company?

Yes. We're a Delaware C Corp. Like every other tech company, probably
all registered at the exact same address.

You've talked to the Canadian government about incentives... but you're
going to continue to be headquartered in Cupertino?

Right now, that's up in the air. OSOM Products, the U.S. company, will
continue to exist. But we may move our headquarters up to Canada.

What are the common threads between Essential and OSOM? Philosophical?
Aesthetic?

Aesthetically, 100%. Even though it's the same designer, Dave Evans and
myself doing the industrial design, we didn't really think about it as
an obvious successor to the PH1, until we had the first prototype it was
like, "this was clearly designed by the same team". Both in a material
standpoint and an appearance standpoint it's a continuation of the same
crew. Our software team, particularly when it comes to Android and
security updates, the team that was responsible for the super,
super-fast updates at Essential are here at OSOM.

Let's talk about advertising. How will you differentiate the brand from
800 other phone makers?

I don't want to give anything away, because I'm super excited about it.
I will put it this way: When we show the broader team the campaign ideas
and the first drafts, people who have been at Essential from the very
beginning, they're like, "why didn't we do that before?" We have to
spend on marketing to differentiate. A big chunk of that money that we
raised is going towards marketing.

What can we expect on the spec-side?

This is a flagship device, both in terms of hardware and software.

Is it difficult keeping the price down for a first piece of hardware?

Not really. The team that I brought over from Essential, when it comes
to supply chain, is some of the best in the world. Our partners have
been astonishingly supportive. We've gotten some amazing rates.
Literally going into a couple of meetings like, "I just want the same
price to give Apple and Google."

So, comparably priced with other flagships.

We're gonna be well under $1,000.

OYO Mulls Slashing IPO Size By Two-Thirds Amid Market Volatility

Inc42

March 27, 2023 Monday

Length: 615 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, March 27 -- Hospitality major OYO reportedly plans to slash the
size of its proposed initial public offering (IPO) amid the prevailing
market volatility and plunging valuations of tech companies.

Sources told Bloomberg that OYO plans to sell just a third of the
originally planned shares in the IPO. The move could directly impact the
amount of fresh capital that the company is expected to raise.

The report said that the hospitality major is all geared up for the IPO
and plans to file its draft red herring proposal (DRHP) as soon as this
week. OYO's current investors are unlikely to offload their shares in
the IPO.

OYO declined to comment on the development.

The reduced IPO could also be the company's way to assuage jumpy
investors that the startup could still clinch a bumper market listing at
its previous valuation.

However, complicating matters further could be a four-year old
development wherein Agarwal picked up a $2 Bn loan, in personal
capacity, from Japanese investors, with the tacit support of Masyoshi
Son, in 2019

Sources said that while Agarwal is not legally bound to disclose
personal debts in the DRHP, the cofounder has reportedly been advised
that market regulator SEBI could view it as an investor risk, which
could lead to inordinate delays or even a possible rejection of the IPO
bid.

The report, citing sources, said that the cofounder's debt has
exacerbated the 'urgency' on the startup's board, which is dominated by
cofounder Agarwal and investor SoftBank, to push through the IPO amid a
'punishing environment' for tech listings and high-profile failures by
Indian startups in recent months.

In A Quagmire

The hospitality major has been in the middle of a storm ever since the
pandemic broke out. As national lockdowns were imposed, people stayed
indoors and the booking plummeted while costs continued to mount.
However, the rebound in travel and holiday demand post the reopening of
hotels provided respite to the company as its bookings improved.

The company claimed to have reported its first EBITDA positive quarter,
with an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortisation (EBITDA) of INR 7.26 Cr in Q1 FY23.

Earlier in the day, CEO Agarwal was reportedly quoted as saying that the
company is on its way to close FY23 with a revenue of more than INR
5,700 Cr as against INR 4,780 Cr in FY22.

He also said that the company is poised to achieve an EBITDA of nearly
INR 800 Cr in FY24.

However, concerns remain over market volatility and regulatory hurdles.
Earlier this year, market regulator SEBI directed the startup to refile
DRHP, directing the hospitality major to provide updated financial
disclosures for the September quarter of FY23.

Making matters worse is the sharp decline in share prices of many of the
listed new-age tech startups. over the last one year.

OYO has also been dogged by losses and is yet to show profitable
numbers. Apprehensions of an impending recession and reduced
discretionary spending by customers have also weighed heavily on many of
the tech companies, including OYO.

Backed by marquee names such as SoftBank and Airbnb, the hospitality
major has been reportedly eyeing a valuation of $9 Bn. Despite the
losses and adverse market conditions, OYO is well placed with the
hospitality sector and is one of the biggest players in the hotel
booking segment which is projected to reach $7.6 Bn by 2023.

Volatility appeared first on Inc42 Media.

igital therapeutics startup Biofourmis said on Tuesday it has raised $35
million in a Series B round led by venture capital firm Sequoia Capital
India and US-based Mass Mutual Ventures.

Singapore-based technology investor EDBI and Chinese online healthcare
platform Jianke also took part, along with existing investors Openspace
Ventures, Aviva Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of insurer
Aviva and SGInnovate.

Biofourmis has a digital therapeutics platform, BiovitalsTM, that is
based on emerging clinical evidence that drug-software combinations can
enhance clinical effectiveness. The platform is used with prescription
software that utilizes wearable biosensors to manage and support
patients diagnosed with heart failure.

The Singapore-based startup last raised $5 million in its Series A round
in December 2017 led by NSI Ventures and Aviva Ventures.

Biofourmis will use the funds to expand its commercialization efforts in
the US and Asia, grow its teams focused on data science, clinical and
regulatory, and sales and operations. By the end of 2019, the company
aims to grow to more than 100 employees in the US and Singapore. Our
core focus has always been to optimize therapies to augment patient care
and health outcomes," said Kuldeep Singh Rajput, founder and CEO of
Biofourmis.

The past year was filled with exciting achievements as our team made
great strides in advancing our products, in addition to strengthening
our regulatory platform and signing contracts with numerous global
pharmaceutical firms. Our new funds will allow us to rapidly expand our
workforce and commercialization efforts, while further demonstrating the
clinical efficacy of our digital therapeutics platform through research
and development," Rajput added.

Biofourmis develops its product and treatment algorithms by running
randomized clinical trials, generating clinical data and demonstrating
safety and efficacy.

The deal marks Sequoia Indias second growth stage deal this year, at a
time when it has been focusing more on early-stage investments, from its
own fund, as well as from a dedicated accelerator programme for
early-stage startups in India and South-East Asia, called Surge.

Mint reported on April 11 that Sequoia led a $26 million round Mobile
analytics and marketing startup CleverTap, at a valuation of about $150
million. In April Sequoia also led a $35.5 million round in mobile
sports gaming startup Mobile Premier League (MPL).

Before the current slew of growth deals, it made a series of growth
investments in January, when it led a $25 million investment in online
insurance platform Turtlemint, and a $40 million round in ed-tech
startup Eruditus.

Health-tech startups have seen rising investor interest over the past
year, sectoral tailwinds such as increased internet penetration, rise in
digital payments and big-ticket government initiatives. Mint reported on
November 12 that health-tech startup funding has hit an all-time high of
$510 million, citing data from Tracxn Technologies.

These were led by medicine ordering website PharmEasy, which raised $115
million across three rounds this year. Other significant funding rounds
include fitness startup Curefit raising $100 million from IDG Ventures,
and online pharmacy Netmeds securing a $35 million round led by
Cambodian investor DPC Group. 2019 Global Data Point.

Point, drew over 100 founders, CEOs, CXOs, and investors from early to
growth-stage startups. The evening brought these professionals together
under one roof to network and hold discussions about today's changing
hiring patterns and workplace culture, which can help build leading
organisations.

India has risen to the fifth largest economy in the world and is on
track to meet its goal of $5 trillion in GDP by 2026-27, which will fuel
growth in the human resources market. The gig economy alone is expected
to add 9 to 11 Mn jobs by 2025 in India, even as the organised sector
fine-tunes its future hiring plan.

The three companies have collaborated to build 'Focal Point' as a
recurring property that aims to help India learn about hiring trends
that will, directly and indirectly, impact several startup and economic
trends. This will help companies understand the evolving hiring market
and align their strategy to meet their human resource needs.

Importance Of Workplace Environment In Attracting & Retaining Talent

The evening began with a fireside chat with Softbank's India Head, Manoj
Kohli and moderated by Inc42's founder and CEO, Vaibhav Vardhan, on the
importance of a strong startup culture. Three themes emerged from this
discussion that startups could emulate.

Hiring At A Sustainable Speed

Organisations must strike the right balance between hiring and firing
people as they deal with human beings, not machines. When the
organisation grows sustainably, 'growth builds up; otherwise, growth
burns down'. Besides, scaling up should follow a systematic, integrated
approach that ensures all aspects of the startup scale up. This scaling
should be methodological, scientific and not ad hoc.

Scalability is something majority of founders do not understand.

Kohli shared practical insights from his days as CEO and Managing
Director at Airtel when they grew the organisation 400 times from 1 Mn
to 400 Mn customers. They scaled their employee base gradually by hiring
people in batches depending on revenue and work visibility. They
followed the principle of always aligning hiring to revenue with
employee additions and revenue growth occurring concurrently.

Even when organisations must lay off employees, they should take a
humane approach to ensure that employees' dignity and self-esteem are
preserved. In this context, Kohli discussed his approach to dealing with
employees who were let go for business reasons. He always strived to get
alternate employment opportunities and managed to rehabilitate at least
50% of them during his tenure as Airtel CEO.

Organisation Culture & Corporate Governance

Organisation culture and corporate governance are critical from day one.
Every employee should understand the organisation's mission and purpose,
and it should percolate down to the last level in the organisation's
hierarchy.

Today's employees expect organisations not to restrict their purpose to
profitability but also include greater societal goals. The
organisation's decisions should be based on merit and reflect the
highest level of ethics and core values of the founders and senior
management.

Culture is the real factor in the organisation.

An essential aspect of a high-performance organisational culture is an
exceptional employee experience. Employee experience has assumed
importance in the Indian context considering the new age talent-driven
economy will contribute the most to the country's gross domestic product
(GDP) in the next decade.

Employee Experience To Attract & Retain Talent

Employees are interested in learning and broadening their skills to
advance their careers. The younger employees are eager to learn and
grow, and the organisation should create a customised learning programme
depending on the needs of individual employees. If the organisation
doesn't organise learning and development opportunities, the employees
may lose interest in working.

Human Resources (HR) should jointly plan career development plans with
employees and enable them to acquire the skills to advance their
careers. They should be forthright and candid with employees and support
them in their career progression.

Employees need to be recognised and motivated every day. Every victory
should be celebrated.

Talent recognition is essential for employee engagement, and the lack of
appreciation by the organisation is a limiting factor. Kohli instituted
a culture of employee recognition at various levels in the organisation
and leveraged it to motivate employees and enhance retention. He
favoured team rewards to nurture the team collectively rather than
individual rangers.

An organisational culture that ensures an excellent employee experience
across their lifecycle attracts quality talent and enjoys higher
retention and good employer brand equity.

Decoding The New Hiring Playbook of India's Fastest-Growing Startups

The evening also held a panel discussion with INDmoney's Ashish Kashyap,
INVESTCORP's Varun Laul, Fountain India's OmPrakash Muppirala and Rage
Coffee's Bharat Sethi. Moderated by Huddle's Sanil Sachar, the
conversation centred around the hiring and retention trends adopted by
startups.

Talent is crucial for business success. The organisation must hire
quality talent, particularly in its early stages, because superior
talent is eight times more productive than average talent. The
non-availability of rightly skilled people will lead to more than 85 Mn
jobs going unfulfilled by 2030, which could result in about $8.5 Tn in
unrealised value.

55% of employee engagement is driven by non-financial recognition, such
as talent development, which is an essential element of organisational
culture. Companies with strong organisational cultures outperform those
with weak cultures in terms of total shareholder returns by 300%.

India is a bright spot in global hiring with a 600 Mn strong workforce.
However, the online-to-offline hiring ratio is 10:90, even with more
than 300 Mn smartphone users. In the next decade, the hiring ratio will
flip, with 90% of hiring taking place through online channels with 10%
taking place through offline channels.

Mapping Hiring To Startup Lifecycle Stages

Talent is still the single most crucial variable, with 25% of the board
conversations revolving around getting the right people and hiring
quality talent. The vital issue for a startup is to formulate a talent
strategy aligned to the needs of different stages of its lifecycle. When
startups are getting people onboard, it has to be sustainable, whichever
industry or lifecycle stage the company is at.

Hiring Mistakes

Startups usually make the mistake of rushing through the hiring process
to scale up fast, leading to poor talent quality. Another hiring mistake
that startups make is believing that hiring people is the only way to
solve the problem, which often leads to wrong hires and overstaffing.

Great people are not always great in all circumstances.

The important thing is to get the right matching algorithm that needs to
play out. The right match is a two-way street; the simple way to achieve
it is to ask the right questions. The candidate and the organisation
need to get into a conversation through a question and answers session
to figure out compatibility.

Talent Nurturing

Founders and senior management need to spend time with the people they
have hired and nurture them, which is critical to success. The founder
must ensure that everyone in the organisation understands the vision and
develops the same entrepreneurial skills that they possess, particularly
senior management. They need to trust the people who work directly with
them and delegate responsibilities to enable them to evolve as leaders.

The founders need to build transparency and align the team to common
goals so that people across functions move in one direction. The team
should remain grounded and ensure that irrational exuberance or
excitement during the growth stage does not derail the organisation from
its mission.

Cut Losses Fast

Startup founders should not refrain from taking tough decisions when the
going gets tough. The decision to fire people is emotional; founders
find it challenging, but if they fail to act fast, they risk their
startup going under. However, founders should ensure they do not let go
of people they trust.

Hiring Trends In 2023

Candidate Pools To Meet The Talent Demand

The global talent base is shrinking, with around 65% of employees who
quit in the last two years either changing industries or not returning
to the workforce.

As a result, recruiters are creating pools of qualified and valuable
talent before the jobs are available. This helps recruiters reach out
and secure the candidate when the job openings are formally announced.

Diversify Talent Sourcing

Full-time employee hiring is the first preference of organisations to
meet their talent needs, while the second preference is internal
recruitment through reskilling and upskilling employees. There is an
increased focus on reskilling employees who have become redundant due to
automation and digitisation.

The third preference to meet talent needs is to leverage the global
talent pool by opting for contract or freelance workers.

Creating A Positive Employee Experience

Organisations must focus on building positive experiences across the
employee lifecycle beginning with hiring. It should strive to deliver
exceptional candidate experience leveraging innovative technology
solutions such as conversational AI to personalise the hiring process.

Businesses can use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to screen the
candidates, the most time-consuming process, to expedite hiring. It will
also help to reduce bias in hiring and promote diversity and inclusion,
which is key to creating a positive work culture and attracting quality
talent. An employee recognition and reward programme is essential to
make them feel valued and improve retention.

Advanced-Data Analytics To Address Hiring & Retention Challenges

Startups must leverage analytics to address talent acquisition,
retention, and engagement challenges. Founders can use analytics to
improve hiring efficiency by identifying the best sourcing channels
through data analysis from previous recruitment drives. Predictive
analytics can help organisations predict candidates' suitability and
compatibility with the organisation's culture.

Advanced data analytics can analyse unstructured data from career
community platforms to identify organisational strengths and weaknesses
as an employer. The insights will enable the HR team to improve employer
brand equity and take corrective measures to reduce employee turnover.

Conclusion

There is increasingly fierce competition to attract and retain quality
talent, which is critical to startup success. Startups must be clear
about their current capabilities and future talent needs, as well as
match their hiring to their lifecycle stage and revenue visibility or
growth potential.

As founders, equal emphasis must be given to building organisational
culture since it cannot be copied and can be the difference between a
startup's success and failure. A high-performing culture based on merit
offers employees equal learning and growth opportunities. Employee
recognition and rewards are essential to keep the workforce motivated
and improve retention.

The famous quote from legendary management consultant Peter Drucker,
"Culture eats strategy for breakfast," aptly describes the importance of
culture in an organisation's success. It means that if the strategy is
strong but the culture is weak, the organisation's strategy will fail.
However, even if the strategy is weak and the culture is strong, the
organisation will achieve its goals.

Stem cell treatment raises hope for multiple sclerosis patients

The Pioneer (India)

June 8, 2018 Friday

Length: 684 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, June 8 -- As there is no established cure for multiple
sclerosis (MS) yet, doctors and patients are pinning hopes on stem cell
transplantation with an interim global study showing that the treatment
is found to be effective to halt the degenerative disease that affects
the brain, spinal cord and immune system, leading to a number of
disabilities.

Currently, there are 23 lakh patients living with MS worldwide. In
India, the number is estimated to be between one lakh and two lakhs. It
is an autoimmune disease which has no known cause or cure.

Dr Kameshwar Prasad, professor and Head of Neurology Department and his
team of experts at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here
are much optimistic about the interim results of the stem cell treatment
for the MS which were shared at the much touted meeting of the European
Society for Bone and Marrow Transplantation in Lisbon in March.

Dr Prasad said that initial results from the clinical trial run from
four international centres has shown that wiping out the patients'
immune systems with chemotherapy, and restoring them with the new stem
cell treatment, appears to halt the disease and improve symptoms.

"We are hopeful of the results - they are a game-changer for patients
with drug-resistant and disabling MS," he said even as he noted that
these were interim analysis. Participants are due to be followed up for
5 years after treatment.

The treatment, called autologous haematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT), was trialed in a group of 100 patients with
relapsing remitting MS - the most common form of the disease.

So far, on an average participants have been followed up for 3 years
from starting treatment. Treatment failure was 6 per cent (3 of 52) for
AHSCT and 60 per cent (30 of 50) for DMD. For the 30 DMD participants
who switched to AHSCT, at one year after stem cell treatment, the
average EDSS improved from 5.2 to 2.6.

Keen to conduct SCT research in the sector, the AIIMS doctors too had
submitted a proposal to the Department of Bio Technology (DBT) under the
Union Science and Technology Ministry for the research in the sector.
However, after sitting over it for the last many years, it has now
rejected the proposal. "We wanted to conduct an advance stem cell
research for MS using either autologus hematopoetic stem cell
transplantation or mesenchymal stem cell therapy. Presently, we are
doing SCT on individual cases after taking approval from the ICMR.

Talking about the drugs available for MS patients, he said, "Prior to
1994, we had drugs only axerpirithen, but now atleast 15 drugs have been
approved by the USFDA and other developed nations. But the main problem
is that these are very costly-from three lakhs to two crores.
Azathropiine which is generic costs a patient Rs 10 thousand per year,"
he said.

Dr Rohit Bhatia Professor at Department of Neurology at AIIMS talked
about the registry for patients suffering from MS to understand the
demographic and clinial profile and risk factors involved.

He also talked about a recently published AIIMS study involving 101
patients at the hospital between 2011 and 2012 that found that 68 per
cent of them suffered from relapsing remitting MS, while rest of the
cases being progressive in nature.

Dr MV Padma Srivastava, Professor of Neurology at AIIMS, stressed on
early diagnosis to ensure early treatment for quality life. Studies
suggest that genetic risk factors increase the risk of developing MS,
but there is no evidence that MS is directly inherited. Environmental
factors, such as low Vitamin D and cigarette smoking have also been
shown to increase the risk of MS, she added.

MS is unpredictable and can cause symptoms such as extreme fatigue, lack
of coordination, weakness, tingling, impaired sensation, vision
problems, bladder problems, cognitive impairment and mood changes,
causing physical, emotional and financial drain on the patients.

Founders and teams

Apart from looking at prior experience, track record, and background,
the investors also want to see if the core leaders have enough skin in
the game. - Kashyap Chanchani, The RainMaker Group

The pitch deck is not main course, it is the side dish. The main course
is the founder. - Sanjay Nath, Blume Venture Partners

Pitching is more about having a conversation or telling a story, as
opposed to going through a deck. - Karan Mohla, Chiratae Ventures

Above all else, in early stage investing, it's the founding team that
really matters. People are mostly investing behind the grit, vision,
execution capability of the founders. - Vishal Chaddha, Xelp

Mental toughness is one of the most underrated qualities for startup
teams. The best founders are able to rightly balance between
perseverance and adaptability. - Karan Mohla, Chiratae Ventures

absorbs things that are important by thorough research and
understanding. - Prashant Prakash, Accel India

The most enduring companies gain dominance because of their unique
understanding of market asymmetry or inflection point. - Pieter Kemps,
Sequoia Capital India

YC Continuity Fund

It is not necessarily the depth of the moat that matters. It's the
width. It becomes harder to cross. - Avnish Bajaj, Matrix Partners India

Founders should ask VCs the type of investment risks they are willing to
take, and how patient are they on those risks. It could be a business
model risk, product risk, cash flow risk, or market risk. - Amit Somani,
Prime Venture Partners

The bar is higher now, so your pitch has to sing. And make sure you have
some proof points/traction to make the case. - Deepak Gupta, WEH
Ventures

A growing company attracts new and big investors who would be willing to
buy out the early-stage investors, along with funding the company for
fueling further growth. - Nisarg Shah, BigSpoon

due to lack of access to funds, but more importantly, mentorship and
networks. - Rajiv Bathla, The Circle.Work

Bertelsmann India Investments

We are ranked number three in the world in the (total) number of
unicorns. - Deepak Bagla, Invest India

India has $2 trillion of wealth in private hands. Less than one percent
is invested in the startup ecosystem. We need High Networth Individuals

come from 20 percent of the deals. - Raj Kumar and Manu Sharma, 'Venture

like there is in math. Instead, it's a complex chemistry of decisions

How Kumar Mangalam Birla salvaged the Hindalco-Aleris deal

MINT

July 30, 2018 Monday

Copyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 1201 words

Dateline: Mumbai

Body

Mumbai, July 30 -- Till March this year, there was no way that Aditya
Birla Group was getting to acquire Aleris Corp.-an ambition it first
harboured in August 2017 when symptoms of a potential failure started to
crop up between an earlier agreed upon merger between China's Zhongwang
USA LLC and the Cleveland-based American company.

Zhongwang was to buy Aleris for $2.33 billion.

The US Department of Justice was closing in on Liu Zhongtian, majority
owner of Zhongwang USA, whose affiliate Perfectus Aluminium Inc. was
accused of evading $1.5 billion in tariffs by illegally importing
aluminium into the US. This development happened even as president
Donald Trump was readying ground for a trade war with China and sought
ways to turn its economy inwards. Several Chinese takeovers of US
companies faced heightened scrutiny by the Trump administration.

In September, the administration blocked a Beijing-backed fund's attempt
to buy an American chip maker, Lattice Semiconductor Corp. In July,
Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co.'s planned $416-million purchase of a
Los Angeles in-flight entertainment company, Global Eagle Entertainment
Inc., collapsed because the companies didn't get approval from the
country's Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS). The same
CFIUS refused approval to Zhongwang USA after 27 US senators urged the
Treasury to reject the sale, calling it a "strategic misstep".

In November, Aleris and Zhongwang called off the deal, paving the way
for the 51-year-old Kumar Mangalam Birla to acquire the company for
$2.58 billion, making Hindalco the world's second-largest aluminium
company and the world's largest aluminium company outside of China.

"There was a period when talks had almost come to a standstill in Aleris
and bankers were told that the acquisition in all likelihood may not
happen," a person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.

Reason: A hike in valuation being sought by Aleris, apart from clarity
on regulatory and people-related issues.

In fact, this was the second time the Group was pulling out from the
race. Aditya Birla Group had first evaluated the transaction in 2008
when it was deciding to bid for Novelis for $6 billion 10 years ago. In
2009, Aleris filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was acquired by private
equity funds Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management, and Sankaty
Advisors in the following year.

"K.M. Birla himself stepped in to address some contentious issues...,"
the person cited above added. In an interview on Thursday, Birla
confirmed that he had to intervene at some point. "I think it was
required and expected. Our acquisitions are about value-creation," Birla
said.

Zhongwang was to buy Aleris for $2.33 billion. So, why did Birla pay a
premium-as many believe? Because, Aleris has made investments of $900
million, which are yet to reflect in its earnings. In two years, once
these investments start to yield returns, the total debt of Hindalco,
which will almost double to $6 billion after this acquisitions will come
down to $3 billion-significantly lower than its current debt of $3.5
billion.

That aside, "Most others were only interested in the US's Lewisport
asset while we were also interested in getting into aerospace and China,
which is going to be our biggest synergy," said Steve Fisher, chief
executive of Novelis Inc.

Nevertheless, the deal bore the hallmark of a long tradition of group
founders stepping in to steer negotiations whenever potential
acquisitions appeared to collapse, whether due to differences on
valuation or other issues. Another example of Birla stamping his
authority on such crucial issues is one of the most complex mergers
between Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd, where he proposed to
Vodafone India to merge with Idea Cellular-a deal for which Vodafone
Group Plc readily agreed even as it virtually meant that Vodafone will
exit the telecom company business and reap dividend as a shareholder
while Birla will continue to run the show in a battle for supremacy
against Sunil Mittal-controlled Bharti Airtel Ltd and Mukesh Ambani's
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.

"Mr. Birla understands the sensitivities involved at late-stage
negotiation of such cross-cultural transactions and the significant
difference it makes when promoters are involved themselves at such
stage," said Bharat Banka, a former head of Group Finance at Aditya
Birla Group, who now runs a niche business and management consulting
practice. "It cuts down negotiation time significantly and it gives a
different level of comfort to the seller(s) reassuring them of the
seriousness and intent commitment of the buyer," he added.

Birla is playing a similar role with the acquisition of Dalmia Cement
now. About Aleris, Aditya Birla Group had sounded off bankers as early
as August last year about the potential deal.

"What worked to the advantage of Aditya Birla Group is that apart from
China's Zhongwang, there were no bidders for the whole company," said
the person cited above. "Aleris operates close to 40 small and large
plants spread across North America, Europe and Asia. Potential bidders
included Japan's Kobe Steel and India's Vedanta group, but none of them
it seems wanted all the facilities", said the first person cited in the
story.

"I am not aware of who the other bidders were but we were given to
understand that much of the interest was centred around the Lewisport
plant only, which is the company's largest facility in North America,"
said Satish Pai, managing director of Hindalco.

Pai in a January interview said that Novelis will now focus on organic
growth by investing $300 million to build an automotive aluminium sheet
manufacturing facility in Guthrie, Kentucky.

The timing of the Hindalco-Aleris deal too was crucial for Aditya Birla
Group. After almost a decade-long lull commodity prices had begun
recovering, thereby freeing up cash flows of both Novelis and Hindalco.
"For the private equity owners of Aleris, this coincided with the timing
of their exit from the asset," said another person aware of the matter.

Birla understood this and pushed for the Hindalco-Aleris deal
aggressively.

At the promoter level too, the timing seems to have worked well. Unlike
the Novelis acquisition where promoters had to infuse close to $350
million in equity, Aleris will be 100% debt funded with most of Aleris
existing debt to be refinanced.

"The entire debt should take care take of itself from the cumulative
cash flows of Aleris and Novelis and I am of the view that some
potential some downward corrections in the commodity prices owing to
collateral damage from global trade war will not impact the margins in a
major way, especially in the context of much larger size of cash-flows
and balance sheet" said Banka.

"Almost all of the large entire capex cycle for of Hindalco and Aleris
seems to be completed and overall EBITDA will only improve from here on,
which should give the Birla Group all the firepower he may need to fund
future expansion without equity dilution," he added.

Business leaders stress on creating value system, and not just profits

New Delhi, Dec. 7 -- Three startup founders emphasized using technology
as an enabler to build a sustainable business model for the future.
Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, they also underscored
the need for promoters or founders to create a value system rather than
just focusing on boosting profits.

According to Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal, the founders of businesses
should decide whether they want to increase the valuation of their
businesses or create a value system (helping the society) through their
products or services. "Ten years ago you could have technology-driven
businesses but now it's not sufficient. Tech is just an enabler for us
to reach millions of people. So, our business is definitely not
technology. We want to build a company which serves better food to
everyone," said Goyal during a panel discussion.

Zomato now directly sources raw material from farmers and supplies to
its partner restaurants, as it seeks to offer fresh food to its
customers without preservatives. The startup also certifies restaurants
which source raw materials, such as meat, from it. The supply of
ingredients contributes around 10% to Zomato's revenue.

Canadian entrepreneur Brad Loiselle, the founder and chairman of betterU
Education Corp., an online education platform, said technology is an
enabler and not a solution, and profit has never been a focus for the
company.

"We will make money, but money has never been a driver. Focus has always
been on solving problems. Our goal is to be profitable and sustainable
at the same time," he said.

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of making India a
$5-trillion economy by 2025, entrepreneurs or founders of startups,
including Goyal and Loiselle, are also expected to play a significant
role in achieving the target.

Jeremy Jauncey, who started Beautiful Destinations, a platform that's
redefining travel marketing in a hyper-connected world, as an Instagram
account in 2012, documented stunning pictures of his travels. Today, the
account, which has over 12 million followers, has become a thriving
community on social media, with over 20 million followers across the
world.

"Travel is a positive force. It is one of those industries in the world
that can truly change lives," said Jauncey at the Summit. Beautiful
Destinations has a combination of original and user-generated content
and offers services as a creative agency, he said, adding: "We have a
mobile society today that travels more. We have this enormous
opportunity to tap on this."

With more and more startups in India joining the unicorn club (with
valuations of $1 billion or more), founders sometimes get obsessed about
increasing the valuation of their respective firms rather than focusing
on creating a proper business model.

Due to the slowdown in global and Indian economy, and failure of some
startups, investors are also becoming cautious about investing in
startups.

Zomato, though, is expected to raise $500-600 in the next three to six
months.

According to Goyal, it's getting harder to raise money, but good
companies will still get funding.

"When you raise money at a billion valuation, then you are expected to
become a $5 billion company next, and for that, you have to raise money
again. Then you are asked to aim at $10 billion. When your competitor
has raised a billion then you also need to raise some funds."

For betterU's Loiselle, the biggest challenge was raising money since
not many people from Canada understand India. "There has to be some
government support. India has the potential to supply workforce to the
rest of the world while my purpose is to bring education," he added.

In 2005, Forbes published a survey that gauged the success rate of
startups, and one very startling revelation was made: 90% of all
startups will fail eventually.

This caused ripples across the startup, SME world, and the investors,
entrepreneurs started digging deep into the ecosystem and attempting to
find the reason for this alarming failure rate.

In our experience at TechAhead, one of the biggest reasons for such a
high failure rate among startups and SMEs is the lack of vision for the
future.

We have observed how brilliant ideas fail to take off because the
founders failed to gauge the massive change in consumer behavior, the
onslaught of newer, sharper technologies, and ignored the tech
innovations that their users desperately wanted.

We at TechAhead are on a mission to change this, forever.

TechAhead Empowering Startups, SMEs With Digital Transformation

In the last 12 years of our glorious history, we have unleashed a
tsunami of digital transformation for startups, SMEs, enterprises,
Forbes 500 companies, and more, and our stunning success rate is the
evidence of our disruptive tech innovation.

At our IT outsourcing company[1], we have a relentless focus on creating
human-centric designs, deploying powerful technologies, and launching
next-gen mobile and digital platforms for global businesses has
unleashed a new era of successful, growth-oriented success stories,
across different verticals.

Our laser-targeted focus on delighting customers, and enabling them to
solve their problems seamlessly has assisted hundreds of our clients to
embrace success &#38; growth, consistently.

And this has a ripple impact: As your business embraces digital
transformation, you attract bright talent, the right clients, and the
attention of experienced investors, who propel your business to grow
further and enable you to crush competitors and dominate your market.

Find out how TechAhead is achieving this high success rate, by
leveraging the power of technology for hundreds of global brands, and
millions of users.

Brace for impact, because the next few paragraphs can change everything
about your business, right away!

Human-Centric Design

The reason why TechAhead is counted among the top 1000 technology
service providers in the world is our dedicated focus on sculpting a
human-centric design approach, that becomes the gamechanger for our
clients.

Be it mobile apps, digital platforms, or IoT-enabled solutions: Our
creative, human-centric, immersive design principles become that
leverage to distinguish our clients from hundreds of other startups and
empower them to carve a unique niche for themselves.

And this is the real success.

Take, for instance, our stunning UX and UI innovation for {The And}
Relationship game, wherein we deployed an Emmy Award-winning design
experience for the end-users, and established our clients firmly on the
various app stores.

We treat design as a revolution, and this is our USP and specialty.

Powerhouse of Talent

We strongly believe that our team is our biggest asset, and we are proud
of our 200+ team members who are digitally native, passionate, and
out-of-the-box thinkers, hell-bent on providing disruptive solutions for
our clients.

While our creative designers, UX/UI experts are based out of Los
Angeles, USA, our sharp programmers are based out of Noida, India,
providing the best of both worlds to our clients.

Our unique model of nurturing the right talent at the right location is
big, powerful leverage for our clients, who are able to work with the
crme de la crme of talent spread across the US and India.

And this translates to massive success.

Next-Gen Technologies

Along with human centric design fundamentals, our biggest strength lies
in deploying next-gen technologies that are powerful, flexible, and
robust.

Unlike our competitors who still rely on age-old technologies, our
expertise in the newer, sharper, and innovative technology stack for
creating mobile apps, website portals, digital platforms, and IoT
solutions gives us a unique edge in the market.

No wonder that we have one of the top reviews on Clutch, a globally
renowned listing portal of service providers, and our clients are in awe
of our tech innovations and deployments.

Some of the top technologies we work on include (but not limited to):
Swift, Kotlin, React Native, Flutter, Node, Angular, React, Vue, Python,
PHP, .Net, AWS, Azure, GCP, Firebase, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins,
Gitlab, Magento, WordPress, Shopify, Salesforce, MySQL, MongoDB,
PostgreSQL, and more.

Our devops consulting[2], and solution architecture consulting are
hugely popular with the tech community.

Leveraging The Power Of IoT, AI, Cloud

When it comes to designing and developing cutting-edge solutions via
IoT, AI and Cloud computing, then TechAhead is the name to reckon with.

We have worked with some of the biggest global brands, and helped them
to offer next-gen technology-enabled platforms for their millions of
users, by leveraging the power of IoT solutions, Artificial Intelligence
and Cloud computing which very few service providers have been able to
achieve.

By deploying next-gen Cloud services, we enabled AXA, world's 2nd
biggest insurance firm to provide their road assistance service upto 80%
faster.

We turbocharged Audi's sales process and helped them generate more
business via Cloud enabled 3D iPad app.

We partnered with American Express and assisted them to generate more
leads via advanced mobility and Cloud solutions.

For the customers of one of the leading smart home heating providers in
the UK, we slashed their electricity bill by 50% by deploying advanced
IoT solutions and hardware innovations using their mobile app as the
primary platform.

We unleashed a never-seen-before IoT innovation for Volatiles, one of
the leading lighting companies, and literally filled the walls with
emotions and energy.

Besides, our business mentorship and guidance combined with
technological innovations and human centric design have worked wonders
for our clients.

This is how we empowered a fitness app to empower 2 million+ moms to
lose 6 million pounds and attract millions of new users from all across
the world.

And this is just the beginning!

In the last 12 years, we have successfully delivered 2000+ mobile apps,
digital platforms, and IoT solutions for 600+ global brands, that
includes American Express, Audi, Disney, AXA, ICC, and more.

Connect with us today, and find out how we enable startups and SMEs to
unleash digital transformation for their business, and turbocharge
revenues, growth, and profits right away!
