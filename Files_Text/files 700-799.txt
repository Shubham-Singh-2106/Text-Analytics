Opera's Africa fintech startup OPay gains $120M from Chinese investors

Body

November 18 -- Africa focused fintech startup OPay has raised a $120
million Series B round backed by Chinese investors.

Located in Lagos and founded by consumer internet company Opera, OPay
will use the funds to scale in Nigeria and expand its payments product
to Kenya, Ghana and South Africa - Opera's CFO Frode Jacobsen confirmed
to TechCrunch.

Series B investors included Meituan-Dianping, GaoRong, Source Code
Capital, Softbank Asia, BAI, Redpoint, IDG Capital, Sequoia China and
GSR Ventures.

OPay's $120 million round comes after the startup raised $50 million in
June.

It also follows Visa's $200 million investment in Nigerian fintech
company Interswitch and a $40 million raise by Lagos based payments
startup PalmPay - led by China's Transsion.

There are a couple quick takeaways. Nigeria has become the epicenter for
fintech VC and expansion in Africa. And Chinese investors have made an
unmistakable pivot to African tech.

Opera's activity on the continent represents both trends. The Norway
based, Chinese (majority) owned company founded OPay in 2018 on the
popularity of its internet search engine.

Opera's web-browser has ranked No. 2 in usage in Africa, after Chrome,
the last four years.

The company has built a hefty suite of internet-based commercial
products in Nigeria around OPay's financial utility. These include
motorcycle ride-hail app ORide, OFood delivery service, and OLeads SME
marketing and advertising vertical.

"Opay will facilitate the people in Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya
and other African countries with the best fintech ecosystem. We see
ourselves as a key contributor to...helping local businesses...thrive
from...digital business models," Opera CEO and OPay Chairman Yahui Zhou,
said in a statement.

Opera CFO Frode Jacobsen shed additional light on how OPay will deploy
the $120 million across Opera's Africa network. OPay looks to capture
volume around bill payments and airtime purchases, but not necessarily
as priority.  "That's not something you do ever day. We want to focus
our services on things that have high-frequency usage," said Jacobsen.

Those include transportation services, food services, and other types of
daily activities, he explained. Jacobsen also noted OPay will use the
$120 million to enter more countries in Africa than those disclosed.

Since its Series A raise, OPay in Nigeria has scaled to 140,000 active
agents and $10 million in daily transaction volume, according to company
stats.

Beyond standing out as another huge funding round, OPay's $120 million
VC raise has significance for Africa's tech ecosystem on multiple
levels.

It marks 2019 as the year Chinese investors went all in on the
continent's startup scene. OPay, PalmPay, and East African trucking
logistics company Lori Systems have raised a combined $240 million from
15 different Chinese actors in a span of months.

OPay's funding and expansion plans are also harbinger for fierce,
cross-border fintech competition in Africa's digital finance space.
Parallel events to watch for include Interswitch's imminent IPO,
e-commerce venture Jumia's shift to digital finance, and WhatsApp's
likely entry in African payments.

The continent's 1.2 billion people represent the largest share of the
world's unbanked and underbanked population - which makes fintech
Africa's most promising digital sector. But it's becoming a notably
crowded sector where startup attrition and failure will certainly come
into play.

And not to be overlooked is how OPay's capital raise moves Opera toward
becoming a multi-service commercial internet platform in Africa.

This places OPay and its Opera-supported suite of products on a
competitive footing with other ride-hail, food delivery and payments
startups across the continent. That means inevitable competition between
Opera and Africa's largest multi-service internet company, Jumia.

https://techbullion.com/agile-consulting-for-tech-startups/#disqus_thread
Currently, technological startups are by far the most popular globally,
outperforming most industries. According to this startup ranking
report[1] from 2021, the US is the leader in innovative startups with
63,703. The second country, India, lags far behind with 8,301.

Unfortunately, startup failure is quite high, and the reasons for this
vary. In most industries, the primary reason is the inability to offer
the right product for the target market quickly enough. Other reasons
include not marketing products correctly, lack of financing for product
development and marketing, and having the wrong team for the job

Presenting the best new products quickly to your consumers is what you
want as a tech startup. You also want to ensure that it is positioned
and marketed correctly to your target market. Therefore speed,
productivity, and product position are vital to tech startups, and agile
consulting helps to improve the procedures and processes required.

What is Agile Consulting?

An agile business can move easily and at a rapid pace. That is the
concept behind agile consulting - to offer your business the ability to
quickly and iteratively react, ensuring it meets all the requirements
and deadlines for product development projects. Agile consulting helps
to eradicate common problems, including developer burnout,
unpredictability, and poor quality when it comes to launching products.
It also helps teams to meet unexpected challenges, allowing for the fast
reallocation of resources.

Why hire an Agile consultant? Typically internal training efforts or
hiring one scrum master is not sufficient to master the roles,
ceremonies and processes that Agile requires. Agile consultants are
trained to be project management specialists, particularly in software
development, but also change management experts, too. Their training is
based on the agile methodology, offering solutions to assist your tech
startup to streamline its entire framework.

The agile method of project management is based on rapid development
cycles (often as short as two weeks). These are short cycles called
'sprints.' The work is segmented, with the team adhering to a defined
team structure and process, with clear roles for the scrum master and
product owner. For startups, this means decisions are made faster and
fewer meetings are required. The streamlined method also means that
solutions are quicker to implement and more likely to delight the target
market.

Advantages of Agile Consulting

An agile consultant can help your startup to implement the right
culture, or it can ensure an agile transformation for an existing
business. The domains where the changes are applied include roles,
processes, and tools. Team members and managers are coached to embrace
agile practices, ensuring excellent product development.

What are the Disadvantages of Agile?

The idea behind Agile is to break down product delivery in small
segments or increments, allowing products to reach the market quickly
and incorporate customer feedback into new features. Often this means
that you will ship a MVP (minimum viable product), and have to do more
development to release the V 1.0 feature-complete product.

Agile does have disadvantages, especially in complex projects, because
different teams define agile differently and it is large to mesh them
together.

Another problem is that Agile does not eliminate documentation, it just
changes the documentation required, often emphasizing user stories over
design documents. Sometimes, projects may easily be sidetracked when
there are no boundaries to keep the Agile team focused on its mission.
Agile does not work well if its team members are working on multiple
projects at the same time. Finally, because Agile tracking is done over
many sprints, keeping track of progress (measured as user stories
completed can be tedious).

Agile Transformation

Agile consulting[2] services, like those offered by TCGen, can help your
tech startup implement Agile methodologies to help your team develop and
improve products faster. Your team can learn how to incorporate user
feedback to improve the product and understand how to identify key use
cases. The Agile transformation can help your startup with metrics for
sustainable growth and improvements, while also helping it develop a
customer-centered approach.

TCGen's approach is to provide a combined approach throughout the team
with customized solutions to meet all the challenges within the
framework of the startup. TCGen's founder, John Carter, has years of
consulting experience, and he led Agile transformations across many tech
industries, like medical, consumer, internet infrastructure, and
throughout Silicon Valley's product divisions. This expertise has taken
years to build, and custom-created solutions can be found for any tech
applications using Agile software tools and other applications.

Final Take

The agile approach, provided by someone with a deep understanding of
Agile development, is designed to assist your startup to work
efficiently toward your goals for growth and sustainability. By working
your projects through the various segments, they are completed in fast
and repeated stages. This increases your team's understanding of the
project, and fast solutions are ensured to counteract any hitches. A
transparent process with more control is created, providing your startup
with increased productivity, better product quality, and customer
satisfaction. Finally, the end product is ready to hit the market at a
faster rate, meaning a higher return on your investment.

Despite the slowdown in venture capital activity, there's still a
mountain of money flowing through startups today. TechCrunch+ is
launching a series of posts looking at recent, notable venture rounds,
exit activity and other news that relates to the financial side of
building new technology companies. While banks are dealing with the
crisis kicked off by the failure of well-known, startup-friendly Silicon
Valley Bank, upstart tech companies are still more than busy raising
capital. They're also looking for exits. More former than the latter,
given the frozen IPO market. But while we wait for the reawakening of a
key exit point for startups, we can still keep tabs on where and how the
money is flowing into their world.

Lessons From the Past 54: Marketing in A Data

Money Life

Does the game change?

An article of a 1,000 words is too small to explain the significant
challenges that one faces in a digital world. That is why my colleague
(Brian Almeida) and I wrote a book titled 'Marketing in a Data/ Digital
World' (available on Amazon). This was a book directed at millennials
who are responsible for startups, and for a few of the earlier
generation, already in marketing, who would be facing the challenge of
the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) era and
the digital era - all at the same time!

However, I am penning down a few thoughts based on the questions
Jaishanker, the consultant, raised, which I am using as a guideline for
this article. Though Mr Jaishanker and I had a connection through
IMC-India, over many years, it was only a few months ago that we
physically met and had a very pleasant interaction. This note is an
extension of that luncheon conversation.

What is my reaction to Peter Drucker's quote: "The aim of marketing is
to make selling superfluous".

I have to admit that I am an old-world marketer. I believe that we can
keep amending, and expanding and refining - but the basic principles do
not change. Sales is a part of marketing. The emphasis on the sales
function may reduce with the evolution of the digital world and the use
of technology. But sales will still be important, and we will never be
able to completely write off selling, which will remain as part of the
marketing mix.

Marketing has gone through a revolution from the days of the 4 Ps

Maybe, to begin with, it was a slower 'evolution'. In more recent times,
it has been closer to being a 'revolution'. We all know that we have
gone through the period of the 4 Ps of Marketing (McCarthy).

Marketers could improve the suitability of their product/service to meet
customer needs by adjusting 4 parameters - product, price, physical
distribution, and promotion. Later, two more Ps were added - People ,
who play a role in defining the matrix and creating effective messaging;
and Politics, which impact trade relationships within countries and
even, locally.

In the 1990s, the focus changed from product and service to the
customer - and Robert Lauterborn of the University of N Carolina, US
came up with the matrix of the 4Cs - Consumer wants/needs; Cost to
satisfy; Convenience of buying; Communication.

The customer became the stronger driving force for product-related
decisions, while the advent of online marketing has reinforced the
validity of the 4Cs - the parameters of communication and convenience of
buying have been most impacted.

Now, digital advertisements are both more relevant and more economical
than mass media advertising. And we know what has happened to the
convenience of buying with Amazon, Flipkart, BigBasket and others
showing the way.

In the 2000s, the Marketing Handbook outlined the 4Rs of Marketing that
pertain to the age of the internet - Relevance; Response; Relationship;
Return.

Prof V Kumar in US is a torchbearer for what we now call Engagement
Marketing (EM). He says that this technique will define a business for
the next five years. Engagement is the total value provided by your
customer over the next three years. This theory has evolved from the
notions of transactional and relationship marketing. EM also makes use
of Customer Lifetime Value - the net present value of future cash flow
from the customer.

In the casual restaurant category, customers who are fully engaged make
56% more visits per month than those who are disengaged. In the
electronics industry, engaged customers make 44% more visits per year
and spend $84 more than those who are disengaged.

Sometime back, I saw a clothing manufacturer analysing the data of those
who had bought shirts at a special sale. Then they sent out a general
promotion for the new blue blazers they had developed. The response was
9%! A month later, they sent out an e-mailer only to those who had
bought blue shirts. The response was 35%. This is a simple example of
how data is now being used!

The shoeshine boy at VT station has taken data collection to its
simplest level. He sees the passing crowds. He taps his box to make a
sound only when he sees a passenger wearing leather shoes. He ignores
the others (the vast majority who wear sandals, sports shoes, and canvas
shoes). He is compiling data and making a selection of the target
audience confidently as he sits at his shoebox.

A question often asked is how the marketing function has contributed to
tackling the business challenges faced by companies in the pandemic era.

I can only tell you that much of my consulting business has crashed.
Surely, companies needed guidance on what to do in such a crisis - but
they also wanted to save every penny in this environment. So, pay for
consulting? No way!

My son ran an event management company in Bangalore. With the pandemic,
there were no conferences, seminars, weddings, or exhibitions. Business
came to a grinding halt!

But when you walk out in the city, you find that many restaurants have
started home delivery services. The shoeshine boy from Chembur station
is now offering home service. My wife buys all her grocery requirements
from BigBasket- and BB has also gone beyond selling groceries to selling
bathroom brushes and other non-consumables. Of course, there are those
who could not change 6Ps - and either shut down or have the financial
strength to wait out for the epidemic to be over.

You will also see the number of online education courses being
advertised. These are colleges and universities with foreign
collaboration - putting in large advertisements in the media. But you
will have to look very closely for the address and find it is somewhere
in Gurgaon or in Telangana. The high visibility of Byjus and of
Bennett - these are sample products of this epidemic.

Do companies improve their client relationship as they go more digital?

The answer is yes and no!

Very often, companies think technology will solve all their problems. It
won't. When I phone my holiday resort company, I get connected to a
voice and then have to press 2 , then 3 , then 4. And then - the agent
is busy. Please hold on. But there is music, to keep you occupied.
Having followed the process three times, I give up!

Also, every time I phone, it is a different person to whom I have to
explain the problem all over again for the third time?? This happens
with my bank, with my insurance company and many other situations.
Working in a PhyDigital world can also be very distressing.

I am sure we will overcome these problems as we go along but as Sanjay
Mehta, Chairman of Unilever says - we are now moving from a VUCA world
to a BANI world - Brittle, Anxious, NonLinear, Incomprehensible!

The number of startups in India is among the highest in the world. Will
all of them succeed?

Not really. They say that about 40% of the startups fail and close down
by the second year. There are some that become Unicorns - and quite
fast. A recent example is SportswearIPO. These are the ones that have
truly identified a market need/want - and developed an appropriate
product - and ALSO built a management team which combines all the
talents required for the success of a business (as Narayan Murthy did
when starting Infosys) and not just depending on one aspect - superior
technology (which is the cause of failure of most startups)!

These are random thoughts on aspects of marketing which will always rest
on the foundation of the 4 Rs and will therefore be able to manage the

Says Sudhir Naidu, founder, Troop Messenger a platform offering utmost
efficiency for smooth and easy to use corporate messaging tool having
the backup of seamless UI and UX.

What's eyecatching about Troop Messenger is its it's wide and special
features like Screenshare, Burnout, Forkout, Orange member. This
accounts for easy texting and emailing at a single platform including
features like respond later, flagging the important mail, docs and
texts, 24 hours technical assistant for support.

Gairika Mitra delves deeper into understanding its functioning...

How do you think is the sector going to upsurge in the near future?

The need for a Team Collaboration and Business Chat sector were never
felt before. There prevailed a fragmented market until Slack made its
space felt, defining the market. Thus, we can say that this sector got
recognised only a few years back. The market is still in its infancy and
is yet to explore and gain momentum as it has impacted a very small
section of the market. But in order to compete with the global market,
the sector needs to be given close attention and according to my
research, I see this sector to reach $100 billion markets by 2025.

What is the exclusiveness of your startup, that's unique from other
gigantic players in the market?

There are two factors which help us stand out from the rest in the
market. One being the value proposition where our platform is abode to
rich features that are made available at low and affordable price.

Troop Messenger comes in two different variants where one is a hosted
and SaaS application while the other is self-hosted/ On-Premise. The
latter helps in targeting large organisations and Governments for whom
data ownership is a paramount requirement. We provide with both the
variants which are difficult to find in the industry.

What is the latest mode of technology that you are catering to?

Our company Troop Messenger caters to filling the loop still existing in
the professional front communication. We come with a solution that
brings together the varied functionality in the office under the roof of
a single platform. Not just this we also assist in reducing down the
unnecessary manual labour with the help of our technology where the
workers do not need to be overwhelmed with minute details like fixing
meeting or reminders for any task. This accompanied with AWS hosted
servers helps in a smooth and easy communication alongside uninterrupted
work

How important do you think is it for people to rely on technology? Are
there any major follies per se?

Considering that without much realizations, technology has slowly crept
into our lives, it is evident that its impact cannot be negated. The
lifestyle of the people has come ahead of a long way from just relying
on electricity for convenience. Today technology has become an
inevitable part of our lives which does not limit itself to the tech
industry. Right from farmers who depend on it for rain forecast to the
rocket scientist who reads the launch trajectory and even everyday
household appliances have felt the presence of technology.

Moreover, under the government initiative, India is consciously shifting
towards digitally aware population. Where the country has willingly
adapted to technology for entertainment, it would be wrong to leave out
the professional front. The widespread network of awareness has made
people conscious of the code of conduct as well as authenticity for
which they are now opting for official apps, which defines their
credibility.

What are your immediate and longterm milestones like?

Our company has come ahead a long way by coping up with the challenges
and resistances faced in any industry. We have ensured a fully
functional, stable and secured application which is industry tested. And
in catering to theses we have expanded our services to the US, Europe
and Oceania who make up 90% of our paid clients. This helps in a better
understanding that the clients see value in their investment for which
they continue their dependence on the application.

Apart from this our application caters to different market segments. One
being SaaS model which serves the small and medium organizations and
another being On-premise for large enterprise and Governments.

All these factors have collectively helped us in creating our visibility
in the market with a plethora of scope to always develop and grow in our
endeavour. In order to take our company to new heights, we plan on
increasing our client acquisition in the near future. When achieved
this, we can move on to expand our company for which we will need to
increase our revenue. Thus, there is a long way to go and we are laying
building blocks to achieve our ultimate goal. Therefore, to take our
company to new heights of success we intend to raise capital through
series A funding.

Lastly, any word of advice for the wannapreneurs?

For all the aspiring entrepreneurs, I would like to suggest that
motivation would be your driving force helping you to unleash the great
potential within you. But here one needs to make a conscious decision of
going after their passion as only this will be your camaraderie that
will help in sustaining the hardships in the long run.

Secondly, be very careful while selecting your team as their shared
aspirations will define your startup's success or failure. Furthermore,
be very considerate and acknowledging of your staff ensuring their
development along with the company's growth to retain hard working and
loyal employees.

Next, you need to be patient, persistent and have faith in yourself
which will help you sail through the hardships and uncertainties and
reach the goal.

ClassDojo's second act comes with first profits

February 04 -- ClassDojo's first eight years as an edtech consumer
startup could look like failure: zero revenue; no paid users; and a team
that hasn't aggressively grown in years. But the company, which helps
parents and teachers communicate about students, has raised tens of
millions in venture capital from elite Silicon Valley investors
including Y Combinator, GSV, SignalFire and General Catalyst over its
life.

If you ask co-founder Sam Chaudhary to explain how the startup survived
so long without bringing in money, he responds simply: "When you have
something that you think will be for the long term you can put [in] a
lot of energy. So, we always kind of maintained the belief that like
bringing people together and helping them be connected, especially last
year when they needed to be apart, physically apart, was going to be
really important."

In layman's terms: ClassDojo has been playing the long-game in edtech
since 2011, quietly aggregating free users-turned-fans across the
world's public schools, which are notoriously hard to sell due to tight
budgets. Every engineer on the team serves a population that is the size
of the city of San Francisco. The company has been intentionally frugal
throughout the process. Its core service, which is an interface that
allows parents and teachers to communicate updates and stay involved in
the classroom, is free for anyone to download.

"Our view from the start was actually that the idea of districts isn't
the customer of education, [that's] kind of backwards," he said. "It's
like Airbnb saying we're going to transform travel by selling to
hotels." The route has helped ClassDojo gain traction with 51 million
users across 180 countries.

Two years ago, ClassDojo tested this customer love. It launched its
first monetization attempt in 2019: Beyond School, a service that
complements in-school learning with at-home tutorials. Within four
months of launching the paid service, ClassDojo hit profitability. In
2020, the added dimension of COVID-19 helped ClassDojo triple its
revenue and grow to have hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers.

 

It's a lesson in how a venture-backed startup can successfully live for
years without any plans to monetize, grow a super-fan user base, and
eventually turn those users into paying customers if the fit is right.

The acceleration of ClassDojo's business got noticed by Josh Buckley,
the new CEO of Product Hunt and a solo capitalist.

"For years, they've quietly been building the most adored brand in the
industry; kids, teachers and families they serve love it. Their business
model follows that vision; they're focused on serving the consumers, not
the 'system'" Buckley said.

Buckley led a new $30 million financing round for ClassDojo, he tells
TechCrunch. The round also includes Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra, Coda CEO
and former Youtube head of product and engineering Shishir Mehrotra,
former product lead of growth for Airbnb Lenny Rachitsky, and others.

The financing comes nearly two years after ClassDojo raised a $35
million Series C round led by GSV. When new capital is less than the
preceding round it usually signals a downround, but Chaudhary says that
ClassDojo had a "significant markup on valuation" with the extension
round. The trend of opportunistic extension rounds has grown for edtech
startups recently as the pandemic underscores the need for remote
learning innovation.

ClassDojo's next actWith new financing and massive scale, ClassDojo is
now trying to evolve from a communication app into a platform that can
help students get better learning experiences beyond the one they get
from schools.

Chaudhary says that they plan to double ClassDojo's 55-person team,
invest in product, and enter new markets.

"For me, I'd always thought ClassDojo could enable a better future,
specifically one where kids' outcomes aren't entirely determined by what
their ZIP code can offer them," Chaudhary said. "That's the kind of
future we've been building toward." He likened ClassDojo's goal as
similar to Netflix: provide a broad scope of material for a broad scope
of people, not just on-demand political dramas.

ClassDojo is already creating content around topics not discussed in
school such as how to fail and how to become an empathetic person, as
part of its Big Idea series. The Beyond School offering helps students
set goals and track activities, as well as find activities such as
dinner table discussion starters or bedtime meditations.

 

ClassDojo charges $7.99 a month, or $59.99 annually, for its premium
content. The platform is finding small ways to add personalization and
spice to its content, such as customized avatars, but further innovation
will be key in making its next phase work.

While ClassDojo certainly has a strong user engine to monetize off of,
the content game is difficult to win at. Content, to an extent, is
commoditized. If you can find a free tutorial on YouTube or Khan
Academy, why buy a subscription to an edtech platform that offers the
same solution? The commodification of education is good for end-users
and is often why startups have a freemium model as a customer
acquisition strategy. To convert free users into paying subscribers,
edtech startups need to offer differentiated and targeted content.

 

The United States continues to be a dominant market for ClassDojo, which
also has users in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and
more. While some in edtech express concern that United States
consistently lags in consumer spending in education, Chaudhary thinks
it's an unfair assessment.

"To believe that, you have to believe that families don't care all that
much about their kids. And I just don't think that's true," he said.
"All the ways that American people express their care for children,
there's such a range, from extracurricular to sports camp to moving to
the right zip code."

And with that mindset, ClassDojo thinks that it can become the brand
that families turn to when they think about a child's education.

"I think there's just like a missing brand in the world right now,"
Chaudhary said. "There's a blank, a lot of fear, uncertainty, and
doubt."

The growth and potential of emerging medical tourism industry is
tremendous given the growing healthcare cost and rising incidences of
non-communicable lifestyle diseases. Over 75% of healthcare insurers
expect healthcare costs to rise in the next three years post-Covid.
Non-communicable diseases will continue to rise and account for 75% of
deaths in 2030, up from 63% in 2013.

In several countries, especially developed nations, the cost of
healthcare has been increasing on a continuous basis. Expenses made by
people on healthcare is slowly becoming a cause of concern. Many people
have to spend their lifetime savings in case they suffer from complex
diseases. While some of the treatments are covered by insurances,
various other elective procedures and surgeries do not come under
insurance covers. In such cases, people are left helpless with no other
option except taking up medical tourism. Medical tourism facilitator
business and agencies proliferated.

How and why did medical tourism grow?

This is most-oft discussed topic in medical tourism guides and training
classes. The field of medical tourism emerged as a boon at a time when
many patients kept waiting for their treatments or paid much more than
the deserved cost of those treatments. Medical tourism offered them
cost-effective healthcare options in foreign countries.

As compared to developed countries, various developing nations provide
effective and high-quality treatments at excellent medical facilities.
Their medical facilities are equipped with all the latest technological
equipment. These facilities are also affiliated with and accredited by
some world-renowned institutions.

While the medical tourism industry is booming, many countries are making
efforts to take advantage of this situation. Their healthcare service
providers are collaborating with various transport and travel agencies,
as well as medical tourism service companies. People can get in touch
with such medical tourism agencies that take care of their complete
medical journey and comforts during their stay within a particular
country.

Systems improvement and governmental efforts have been turning certain
developing countries into preferred medical tourism destinations. Some
of these countries include Singapore, Thailand and India.

Slowly and increasingly, people have been opting for medical tourism in
foreign nations where the cost of treatment is low and the delivery of
treatment is faster. The governments of several countries have been
increasing their healthcare budgets and investments so more medical
tourists can be attracted.

They are also investing in organizing medical conferences and gaining
accreditations for more of their healthcare facilities. A few of the
countries have also been competing to become the most preferred, global
medical tourism destination by providing superior elective procedures
and medical treatments.

Main reasons behind the global growth of medical tourism

Medical tourism is a phenomenon that has raised many questions in our
minds. It is a practical solution to problems such as availability and
affordability of medical treatments. The developed nations offer
excellent medical amenities to its citizens but those are very highly
priced and most of the intricate or complex surgeries are not within the
budget of the middle class or working class people.

Not only medical facilities but also other amenities like education are
expensive abroad. So, if middle class parents want to get their kids to
college, they have to save substantial amount of sum for that. Medical
expenses can make them change their previous plans or compromise with
their dreams.

Medical tourism offers an excellent alternative for patients by cutting
down the expenses by up to 50 percent. The developing nations also have
great medical facilities and use the most modern surgical equipment.
Previously patients were scared to go out of their comfort zone for
major surgeries or critical treatments but globalization has changed
that a lot.

Today, people interact with people of other countries via social media
platforms and they have a better perception regarding the outside world.
Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter has helped in breaking
the cultural gap that reigned supreme in the previous decade.

Getting information has become much easier, all thanks to the Internet.
People can learn all about the city they are going to or the hospital
where they will be treated online. This has also helped in diminishing
the inhibitions working against medical tourism and the fear of the
unknown.

Medical tourism facilitators have improved their approach towards
patients and their service quality is good which has helped people trust
in them. In a rich country like Canada, people cannot get MRI or X-ray
done instantaneously. The Canadian government sponsors the health system
and everybody is treated in turn. So, they have to wait their turn for
weeks.

Health insurance policies do not cover cosmetic surgeries and
complicated surgeries or treatments. People get immediate medical
attention when they travel to a developing nation of their choice and
also they can get accommodation in good local hotels and do some
sightseeing if they wish. Saving money and getting intensive care of
good quality are the two vital reasons that have popularized medical
tourism among people of the developed nations.

Medical tourism - Where tourism and treatment go hand in hand

Medical tourism is no more an unknown term.You are familiar with the
concept of the complete new industry of health or medical tourism that
combines the affordability of medical treatments with the joy of
traveling. With the rising popularity of health tourism across the
globe, knowing about this latest trend has become a must for each and
every person. We have focused on a few facts in this article, which will
help you learn about the medical tourism industry and how tourism and
treatment go hand in hand there. Those into medical tourism business or
are planning to be medical tourism facilitators can benefit from the
following discussion.

About the Medical Tourism Industry

Before digging into the working process of the medical tourism industry,
you should know what medical tourism actually is. It is basically a
practice of traveling to a less developed country from a high developed
one for taking the advantages of cheaper medical procedures, great care
and world-class services. But the best thing about this industry is that
it offers an excellent opportunity to explore the new places along with
availing the medical facilities. That is why the concept of health
tourism is getting popular substantially.

From the Perspective of 'Treatment'

Developing countries like India, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea,
Panama, Bulgaria, etc. have earned global fame as most excellent medical
tourism destinations. All of these are known to offer first-rate medical
treatments at significantly lower costs along with amazing
infrastructure, highly efficient medical professionals, most advanced
medical tools and equipment, and so on.

A variety of treatments or medical procedures can be performed at the
hospitals or other medical facilities present in these nations. These
include cosmetic surgeries, dental surgeries, neurosurgeries, cardiac
surgeries, Lasik eye surgeries, and many more. In short, it is the best
way to get 'First World Treatment' from 'Third World Countries'.

From the Perspective of 'Tourism'

All the countries mentioned above are also well-known for their scenic
beauty. From the 'Green City' Singapore to the 'Bridge of the World'
Panama, you have a lot of options to enjoy the breathtaking natural
views. Here comes the importance of medical tourism. When overseas
patients come to these countries for the purpose of treatment, they also
get an awesome opportunity to take pleasure in the majestic mountain
ranges, deep blue ocean, serene sandy beaches or even historical
monuments. There is no need to arrange separate tours. In addition, they
can enjoy to the fullest by spending once only.

In a nutshell, medical tourism has opened up a complete new horizon for
people around the world. Hence, it can be said that the future of the
medical tourism industry and business is significantly bright.

Cost Effective Medical Treatment to Propel Medical Tourism Growth

The market intelligence reports concerning GlobalMedical TourismMarket
Research and the expected movement in 2021 have been based on past
trends and future consumers' preferences. The in-depth survey brings out
the pronounced path along whichthe growth of medical tourism sector is
mapped out for years to come.

Factors that would facilitate or dampen the spirit of consumers
travelling abroad for medical treatment have gained clarification. They
have been identified from case to case basis figuring out their possible
impact on healthcare services abroad which covers:

* Medical treatment.

* Cosmetic treatment.

* Wellness therapies.

Medical tourism businesses should factor in these features to serve
their customers.

Medical expenses: The key factor

The survey provides additional features of the market where the major
stakeholders of medical tourism function. Their game plans, stakes,
product profiles, decisions and survival tricks have been explored in
detail.The prime factor deciding the future of medical tourism, however,
balance around thepivotal role of expenses that is very much felt while
you take a medical trip.

Whether you recover from your ailments or not is a different matter
altogether. Your expenses are very much real. They sometimes inflict
more pain than the illness itself. Without proper planning and prior
survey of situations, a medical disorder not only has the potential to
rob you of a healthy life. It can ruin you financially. Consequently, a
cost effective medical treatment is imperative. What you pay for
recovering from illness is a crucial element that will shape the growth
pattern of medical tourism in future.

Treatments opted by medical tourists

Medical tourism represents a temporary migration of consumers from their
own countries to a foreign country in the quest of treating health
disorders. According to expert medical tourism consultants, healthcare
services sought by medical tourists include:

* Orthopedics

* Cardiac surgery

* Oncology

* Dental care.

* Cosmetic surgery and implants.

* Brain surgery and related neurological treatments

* Weight loss surgery

* Fertility treatments

* Stem cell therapies

* Routine health check-ups

* Wellness therapies and programs

Theeconomy of countries encouraging medical tourism to try their medical
facilities and clinical services is no doubt on the rise. They are
experiencing a flourishing market in the domain of providing healthcare
services.

The growing need for cost effective medical treatment

Keeping in view a prospective customer's spending potential on medical
services offered, it is critical for successful expansion of healthcare
market to foreign patients.When the price offered by a foreign medical
facility is way cheaper than what is being offered by the domestic
hospitals, the customer preference automatically shifts towards the
foreign hospital.

Costly medical treatments in developed countries like the US, UK,
France, Italy, Germany and Australia is the primary cause leading to the
patient's movement to greener pastures. Just think of the staggering
number of 50 million! It is the size of US population going without
insurance coverage.

So why shouldn't they opt for countries with cheaper medical
treatmentestablishments? For many US citizens, there is no coverage of
dental insurance. The only expensive remedy is to get their set of teeth
treated that burns a big hole in their wallet and that's painful!

Records reveal that back in 2012, 1.6 million Americans ventured abroad
in search of cheaper and quality medical treatment that hardly involves
any waiting time. Expense on medical treatments in developing countries
is around 30 %-50%cheaper than in developed countries. Wouldn't it be
wiser to go for an option where the customer can save an appreciable
amount even after incurringflight booking expenses, accommodation cost
and local trip expenses abroad?

Cost effectiveness - Factors to be considered

Cost effective medical tourism that sets rolling the wheels of growth
takes into account many factors besides involvement of money. They are
chiefly:

* The adoption and operating knowledge of upgraded medical technology by
the developing countries. The quality of treatment is at par or
sometimes even better than expensive clinics of affluent nations.

* The resemblance of culture and geographical proximity are important
driving factors as well. The US and Mexico are closely placed along
borders. While treatment in the US is costly, it is way cheaper in
Mexico. The flight expenses are too much either. As a result, every year
there is a flood of US patients getting treated in Mexican hospitals.

As the global healthcare tourism market has long past its childhood
days, for its booming expansion, it will need a close coordination
between medical tourism facilitators, agencies, medical tourism
consultants, service providers, government agencies and the insurance
companies so that the users of this dynamic industry reap the harvest of
their effort, time and money. This is the essence of cost-effective
medical treatment that will prepare grounds for further growth of
medical tourism.

Medical tourism helps developed countries make their citizens' medical
bills affordable

The boom in global medical tourism in the 21century has several reasons
no doubt but availing the best treatment involving least expense is the
main driver where health care seekers from developed countries are
unhesitatingly opting for cross border medical treatments often punched
uniquely with a vacation package.

Unaffordable medical bills - The scenario in developed countries

Medical insurance is a must in a developed country like US, but a recent
survey reveals that one out of 5 Americans are unable to afford the high
medical bills. The objective of health care insurance is to shield the
customers from medical expenses, but in reality the scene is just the
opposite where exorbitant medical bills go beyond the insurance
coverage.

Often, the medical bills are so high that the survey also points out
that:

* 60% of the customers have to shell out a huge chunk from their savings

* Some percent of customers had to add extra work hours to earn more
money for paying the bills

* A fraction has deferred their essential household purchase or holiday
plans.

* Near to 40% customers' credit card debts rose sharply adding pressure
in financial commitments.

* Unexpected claims by the insurance providers add to woes in many cases

* Sometimes, out-of-the-coverage-care expenses are quite pinching when
the customer is caught unaware that those care services do not fall
under the coverage.

As a consequence:

* 60% of US medical insurance holders have postponed their dental
treatments

* Nearly 40% are avoiding prescribed medical tests which might pose
serious health threats

* A considerable number of health care seekers opted not to go for a
prescription

These are the prime driving factors based on which medical tourism
businesses can reap great profits.

Booming medical tourism in Asian countries - The brighter side of
affordability

Considering the above factors, let us study what Asian health care
sector has in store for medical tourists from developed countries in
terms of quality and affordability.One thing is for sure that medical
treatment costs in the developing nations like India, Honk Kong and
Singapore is several times lower than those in developed nations but the
quality of treatment even in case of critical ailments is at par with
US, UK etc. if not high. Moreover, the availability of low cost manpower
in these countries has enabled to restrict the entire medical treatment
and support cost within a very much affordable limit.

Cost comparison

For example, if hip replacement cost in US is 24,000$. Whereas in India,
it would be about 4 times lesser. In Singapore and Thailand, cost for
the similar treatment would be 15,000$ and 10,000$ respectively.
Similarly, coronary angioplasty which will cost 41,000$ in US can be
treated within 3500$ in India. Medical tourism marketing strategies
strongly focus on this cost factor to attract patients from distant
countries.

The cost further gets controlled with suitable medical insurances where
the insurers willingly reimburse the abroad medical costs as it is much
lower than the domestic rates. Many reputed clinics abroad have tie ups
with the insurers to gain more advantage in the competition. Medical
tourism insurance is available in many countries encouraging health care
seekers to opt for cross-border medical services.

The tough competition among the top medical tourism destinations also
helps to check the cost of treatments and services. Each and every
country will not allow losing the potential abroad customers by raising
the treatment cost.

Superior service

A great chunk of medical tourists from developed nations appreciate that
quality of services provided by nurses and the supporting staff till
full recovery in abroad clinics is much superior than that available
back home. In most of the cases, charges for these support services are
included in the package and even if any additional charge is required,
it is quite less. Abroad hospitals are now seriously considering the
hospitality factor providing a superior relaxing ambience to help the
patient recoup fast. Designed suites, luxury accommodations and the like
are either equipped within the clinics or are arranged separately by the
medical tourism facilitators.

Ease of travel

Flying for health is quite a common practice today. Air travel has
become so extensive past few decades due to globalization along with a
significant drop in air fares that a person's medical tourism cost
package comfortably fits the bill. Relaxed visa regulations in medical
tourism with issuing of special medical visas by many countries popular
in medical tourism have made travel hassle free giving the health care
seeker the opportunity to avail the best treatment available.

Is Medical Tourism a boon for the healthcare industry?

The major reason behind many patients opting for medical tourism is its
cost effectiveness. At some destinations, complex medical treatments and
procedures would only cost them about one-tenth of the price within
their home countries.

Countries like India, Thailand and Singapore offer high-quality
treatments at amazingly low prices. Additionally, some developed
countries put stricter regulations on certain types of surgeries and
elective procedures. These procedures can easily be performed in
developing countries.

Apart from the above factors, medical tourism can also be a means of fun
and relaxation for some patients. Along with medical treatments,
patients also go for recreational activities in foreign countries. They
get a chance to enjoy the food, shopping and tourist sites at their
place of visit. Thus, medical tourism gives people an opportunity to
plan their healthcare and vacation schedules together. These and many
more reasons are turning medical tourism into a boon for the healthcare
industry. Further, there are several benefits of medical tourism for the
healthcare industry in general.

With more and more people taking up medical tourism, countries have also
been developing their infrastructure and culture. Some leading players
in the medical tourism industry are gaining a lot of foreign capital
through medical tourists. In addition, their healthcare services and
employment opportunities are getting better with an increase in medical
tourism.

A destination also gets to improve its environment and culture when more
people start visiting it. Presently, various medical tourism businesses
support people with all their treatment, lodging and travel requirements
at different destinations. Thus, a patient does not need to take stress
of making all kinds of arrangements on his/her own.

Before people opt for medical tourism, they should ensure to hire a good
medical tourism facilitator. An efficient company gathers and provides
all the necessary information to medical tourists regarding their
complete medical journeys. Thus, the quality of the hired firm should be
confirmed online before actually availing their services. A good medical
trip not only benefits patients, but also the healthcare industry in
general.

How big is the global medical tourism market?

As more and more patients seem to be in dire need of quality medical
care, the hospitals in developed economies such as that of the United
States are falling short of catering to this demand. Also, the expense
of healthcare in these economies is extravagantly high, resulting in
lack of enthusiasm amongst some of the natives in opting for these
services.

The proliferation of medical tourism is often stated to be as a result
of the rising cost of medical care in nations like United States and in
the near future, more and more medical tourists are expected to visit
the emerging medical tourism destinations.

So what does the future hold for this industry? The prospects look
promising. As the countries like the UK, Canada and US are trying to
consolidate their medical services, the average cost of medical care per
patient is inevitably rising.

If a patient gets the same kind of facility at an overseas location,
that too at a fraction of the cost; why will he not take it? The medical
tourism industry is expected to progress at a rate of 9.5 percent
annually, which is a superb achievement if it does progress at that
rate. So why do people go for these medical tourism services apart from
cost reduction factor?

Virtually no waiting time

As patients throng the hospitals in developed economies, they do not
have a need of catering specially to patients. In addition to this,
waiting times are excruciatingly longer for the patients resulting in
discomfort. Travel to medical tourist spots, be it Costa Rica or India;
can significantly give the same quality of service at a substantially
lower cost and without having to wait for a longer duration.

Quality of service

Many hospitals in these medical tourism destinations have healthcare
services which match and rival those present in developed economies. Be
it the presence of high-quality staff, good and world-class facilities;
they seem to have it all that is present in developed economies'
hospitals.

Thus, medical tourism is slowly but steadily emerging as an option for
tourists across the world as a convenient and reliable means of seeking
treatment at a very affordable rate. The industry looks set to grow at a
steady rate in the near future.

Reasons behind the worldwide growth of medical tourism

It is surprising how so many people understand the concept of medical
tourism. The popularity of medical tourism is the by-product of
increasing medical treatment costs. It has opened new channels and
bridged the gaps between different cultures. Medical tourism industry is
supposed to expand and grow in the coming years.

This industry is being valued and regarded as one of the most profitable
industries to venture into by the tourism companies. The basic concept
of medical tourism involves traveling to a developing nation for
low-cost treatments. It is true that the developed nations have great
medical infrastructure but the sky-high bills can be seriously daunting
for a middle-class family. This has created great opportunities for
medical tourism businesses of different capacities

We all have to save for the future and cannot spend every penny we have
on intricate treatments. There are many people in the US who do not have
good quality medical insurance or health policies. When a sudden health
disability occurs, they have to wait for a long period before they can
get the ailment treated and cured. This can be emotionally exhausting
and physically painful. Medical tourism brings respite from severe
health concerns and at least shows a light at the end of the tunnel.

Medical tourism has many benefits but the foremost among them is the
monetary benefit. Medical tourism is the most cost-efficient option for
middle class people of the developed countries. The cost of a surgery is
reduced by 50 to 60 percent at least when the patient travels from the
US to developing countries like Thailand, India, or the Latin American
countries.

Medical tourism industry has inspired some of the most renowned nursing
homes around the world to employ a special manager for attending to the
needs of the foreign patients thus creating new avenues for medical
tourism businesses. For example, bone marrow transplantation can cost
$200,000 in the US but the same treatment will only take around $25,000
in a reputed Indian nursing home.

The misconceptions and doubts regarding medical tourism are being
dispelled fast. People now have more access to information
instantaneously due to technological improvement. Patients can directly
contact different nursing homes in the developing nations and ask for
convenient packages for themselves.

Another reason for the worldwide popularity of medical tourism is the
fact that many people nowadays want to get cosmetic surgeries like butt
enhancement or breast augmentation done at low cost. At the same time,
people would like to see a new place and visit exotic tourist spots. The
great quality of services and well-qualified doctors, educated at
western medical schools make medical tourism more reliable. The trust
that medical tourism has gained makes it more lucrative. The tourism
industry and hospitals have joined hands to make the best medical
services readily available for the foreigner patients.

Medical tourism is a blessing for the destination and the travelers

Medical tourism has emerged as one of the most promising global
industries by successfully combining tourism with medical care
facilities. Patients from developed countries are traveling to the
developing nations for getting low-cost healthcare privileges. Developed
countries are not being able to provide timely medical care at
reasonable prices.

Regular price hike of medical care has turned people against their
national health care system. They are going online to find out best
medical tourism destinations where they can receive high quality
treatments at half the cost. At the same time, the economy of host
countries also gets a major boost from the money spent by foreign
patients.

It is a win-win situation

Not all Third World countries are capable of offering high quality
medical care facilities at low price rates. However, many of them are
trying to compete with the already established leaders of this industry.
In their attempt to make a name as medical tourism destination these
countries are striving harder to improve the healthcare systems.

Some of the most popular medical tourism destination countries are
India, Thailand, Brazil, Singapore, Mexico and Malaysia. Every year
millions of patients travel from United States of America, Canada, UK
and other developed countries to these medical tourism destinations.
Medical tourism is boosting the economy of these countries. The medical
tourism industry of India has already surpassed the billion-dollar mark.

By traveling to low cost medical tourism destinations, the medical
tourists are saving huge sums of money. They are not only receiving
advanced healthcare facilities right on time but also enjoying vacation
in a foreign locale. Medical tourists can save up to 70% of their
surgical cost if they choose India or Thailand as their medical tourism
destination. Medical tourism is a win-win situation for the travelers
and the medical tourism facilitators.

Patients should be picky and cautious

Despite the plethora of facilities offered by medical tourism
facilitators, patients should be very cautious while making a decision.
A patient's life can depend on choosing the right medical tourism
destination and the best hospitals. Anyone who is interested in going
off shore for medical treatments should check the right doctors,
surgeons, hospitals and medical tourism facilitators thoroughly.

One should read reviews and go through patient feedbacks. Talking to
previous patients who have taken the services of a particular medical
tourism facilitator will also help. Patients should also demand a clear
estimate of all the expenses so that the hospitals cannot increase the
final billing amount.

Hosting countries are counting profits

Medical tourism has made it easier for patients of developed countries
to get affordable treatments and also opened a new channel of income for
the hosting countries. The tourism sector of developing countries are
also growing and prospering along with the expansion of medical tourism
industry. Both local and national economies are getting a boost from the
money foreigners are spending.

For the foreigners the money they spend for medical tourism is less than
what they have to spend on same treatments in their own country. For the
developing nations the same amounts are precious. For catering to the
foreign patients developing countries are trying improve their
infrastructure and medical care systems.

They need to establish a positive and reputable image for attracting
more patients. As a result these countries are developing from different
aspects and their citizens are also getting the benefit of advanced
medical technologies.Medical tourism does not only help the patients of
developed nations but also the hosting countries. The economies of
hosting countries are getting a boost from this industry.

Growth prospects for medical tourism in the stagnating industry

Many medical tourism start-ups fail to thrive regardless of the
destination they are set up. It is in human nature to blame external
forces for their failure. Similarly, it is often the weakness of the
market, stated as the reason for failure of medical tourism start-ups.
Medical tourism industry demands executives who have the potentials to
look beyond, ignore these excuses, and focus on achieving profitability
and success.

Stop hoping on hope

One has to understand that medical tourism industry is a low growth
industry in comparison to the other industries and there exists many new
entrants on the belief of being hopeful. Unfortunately, hope does not
bring success in this industry. You must have often heard the quote that
winners don't do different things they do things differently. In order
to grow in the medical tourism industry you have to incorporate this as
your major idea in your medical tourism business strategy.

Medical tourism projects that tend to do well in a stagnant industry
grow by undertaking the market share of their competitors, in a
profitable manner and often without reducing the prices. Profitable
medical tourism business projects often create their very own growth
cycle. This growth cycle is completely independent of the industry
cycle.

Equilibrium and disequilibrium positions

Equilibrium position occurs when a group of medical service providers in
variant destinations, with similar qualities and services compete within
a market and earns similar returns, amass market share. Under
equilibrium, there remains a constant battle for the smallest of market
share as well.

Disequilibrium position has those elements that make it rather more
interesting. Here companies responsible for creating such disequilibrium
situations do not follow the templates. They always seek to find
creative ways for leveraging particular type of competitive advantage to
shift the market scenarios in their favor and work towards keeping it
the similar way. They make others envious as they achieve a definite
edge over others by performing well in stagnant market industry set up.

Building disequilibrium situations in healthcare tourism

As an executive in the medical tourism industry, if you wish to create
disequilibrium situation with the aim to cater to a larger market share,
here is what you need to do:

* Make relevant changes in the supply side of the market. The changes
should be such that it pushes the market into one direction, which
generally favors the client, providing noticeable advantages in the
quality, safety, services, functionality, and selection etc

* Make relevant changes in the demand side of the market. Try to capture
the demand that did not exist earlier or was rather inaccessible. Demand
side changes come with technological shifts for proper management of
business workflow.

The changes in the demand side of the markets can be made by enforcing
new regulations and medical tourism laws regarding the general
framework. The projects, who abide by these new regulations, will be in
a position to meet the demand of the customers and increase their
profits. This helps them earn greater revenue especially by adding
gigantic market advantage.

Identify your potential

Before you think of creating a disequilibrium position in the market,
make sure you have everything that it needs to create a disequilibrium
position. Identify your potentials and analyze whether you posses the
following properties.

* Analyze what makes you unique - customers value uniqueness, aim to
enhance customer value

* Edge over your competitors - competitive advantage is the biggest
benefit

* Strategic plan to address any forthcoming technological or regulatory
shits that has the capability to transform your market

The stunning and unlikely factors that work in favor of overseas Medical
Tourism

It would generally be believed that the developed world offers much more
in the area of medical treatment. While this belief is not false, it is
not essentially true either. The developing world, especially countries
with fledgling medical tourism markets, are quite the leaders in
accepting and encouraging new technologies. These, and several other
factors provide logical benefits to medical tourism destinations. Let's
take a better look at such factors:

Acceptability of services at other destinations

While a few governments in western developed nations do not accept
certain medicinal therapies or complicated surgeries, some developing
countries offering medical tourism consider the requirements of patients
as their first preference and allow them to receive those treatments
with utmost care.

Availing the medical services at the foreign destinations that are not
otherwise legally accepted in their home countries wasn't possible for
patients before the concept of medical tourism came into being. Many
countries have put regulations on certain non-emergency procedures as
well as complex surgeries. Some of them have even banned those
treatments due to several reasons.

However, when it comes to other destinations like developing nations,
people can take advantage of the lenient laws and regulations and get
services that they wish. Besides, they do have a selection of countries
to choose from, so even if the preferred treatment is not available in
some countries, it may be available in another country.

Facts and insights related to Medical Tourism, highlighting services in
Mexico

Mexico, one of the most popular medical tourism destinations in the
world, has gained much popularity for its stem-cell therapy. The U.S.
Government does not accept the unique intervention strategy that is
useful in treating a range of injuries and diseases.

Similarly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) kept Hip
Resurfacing, which is a surgical substitute of Total Hip Replacement or
THR, under regulation for a long time. The procedure is recognized as
one of the most helpful solutions for patients suffering from
non-inflammatory degenerative joint diseases.

Furthermore, it has an excellent success rate at more than a few
well-known medical tourism destinations. None of these was enough to
receive approval for the surgery from the American Government. However,
the issue has been resolved now and the U.S. Government finally allowed
the surgery in the year 2006.

The situation is quite clear from these two facts. You can say that if a
person wants to undergo any of those elective surgeries that are either
not legal or available at his or her home country, going across the
border can be a better option. In short, medical tourism works as the
great savior for such patients.

Availability and better quality of healthcare services

There is a myth that patients need to compromise with the quality to get
affordable treatments and care during medical vacations. Countries
offering medical tourism always focus on the superiority of their
services and try to maintain excellence in order to ensure the highest
quality of care to lure a greater number of international patients.
Providing quality care in all medical and non-medical requirements is
the basis of any medical tourism business.

The majority of hospitals, nursing homes and other medical facilities
present in developing countries have standard accreditations from Joint
Commission International (JCI) and International Organization for
Standardization (ISO). Both of these global accrediting bodies have
strict prerequisites that every healthcare organization needs to fulfill
prior to getting the accreditation.

Some of them are also affiliated to various well-known American
establishments like the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the
Harvard Medical School, etc. and work in collaboration with those. The
objective of such associations is to provide the best possible
healthcare services to foreign patients.

Quite a few other factors also contribute to the amazing quality of
services offered by medical tourism. Governments of various developing
nations are investing lots of money in the healthcare sector for
improving their infrastructure as well as giving a significant boost to
the entire medical tourism industry. As a result, well-equipped medical
facilities and trustworthy medical tourism businesses are coming up with
each passing day, which are ultimately enhancing the quality of services
and making healthcare accessible for all.

Developing countries boast of having numerous qualified and talented
doctors as well as medical consultants. They are skilled, efficient and
have many years of working experience in reputed healthcare
organizations in the USA or UK. The nurses and other hospital staff are
also quite proficient and helpful. Therefore, global patients can always
get a more customized as well as personalized service for themselves
during medical vacations.

The application of a range of cutting-edge medical tools and equipment
has also turned these medical facilities into the best ones in the
entire world in terms of the standard and quality of services.

Privacy

Patients often look for privacy in the medical facilities available in
their home countries but usually fail to find it. Though the need for
secrecy or confidentiality can vary from person to person, it plays an
important role in the case of certain surgeries or medical procedures.
Medical tourism facilitators play a vital role in ensuring privacy and
confidentiality of foreign medical tourists.

Many people want to keep their healing procedures as furtive as
possible, especially when it comes to various cosmetic surgeries. They
do not even mind flying across the border in order to maintain their
confidentiality. Medical tourism is bliss for these people as it
provides a perfect environment to keep them away from prying eyes.

Cosmetic surgeries or procedures are medical specialties that many
people opt for these days. These are non-emergency or elective
surgeries, which patients intend to enhance their appearance or remove
aging signs from their face or body. People who undergo these beauty
treatments often try to stay away from their surroundings during their
treatments in order to avoid inquisitive eyes and uncomfortable
questions. Medical tourism businesses, facilitators, and agencies should
pay serious attention to these to give patients a more fulfilling and
rewarding experience.

There is a great variety of cosmetic surgeries, such as rhinoplasty,
liposuction, breast augmentation, facelift, etc. offered by various
medical tourism destinations. Those who want to undergo any of these can
opt for a medical tour and obtain the best possible treatments at a
reasonable price, without having to worry about prying eyes.

Medical professionals working in the healthcare organizations of
different medical tourism destinations ensure the utmost privacy of
their clients by making use of all those standards of confidentiality
that are maintained in American hospitals.

Issues related to Medical Tourism Growth

* Accessing reliable information

* Too many newcomers jumping on medical tourism bandwagon not
experienced or understanding of the industry

* Lack of pre and post-operative care arrangements

* Complicated intra country laws and legal procedures

* Lack of support system by government bodies

* Patients not being properly informed about pros and cons

* language difficulties and other communication problems

* Cross cultural misunderstandings

* Challenge for hospitals and providers in maintaining internationally
accepted standards

* Lack of willingness to travel abroad for medical treatment

* Other reasons

Mumbai, May 22 -- Digital therapeutics startup Biofourmis said on
Tuesday it has raised $35 million in Series B round led by venture
capital firm Sequoia Capital India and US-based Mass Mutual Ventures.

Singapore-based technology investor EDBI and Chinese online healthcare
platform Jianke also participated in the round, along with all existing
investors Openspace ventures, Aviva Ventures, the corporate venture
capital arm of insurer Aviva, and SGInnovate.

Biofourmis has a digital therapeutics platform, BiovitalsTM, based on
emerging clinical evidence that drug-software combinations can enhance
clinical effectiveness. The platform is used with a prescription
software that utilizes wearable biosensors to manage and support
patients diagnosed with heart failure.

The Singapore-based startup last raised $5 million in its Series A round
in December 2017 led by NSI Ventures and Aviva Ventures.

Biofourmis will expand its commercialization efforts in the UA and Asia
and grow its teams focused on data science, clinical and regulatory, and
sales and operations. By the end of 2019, the company aims to grow to
more than 100 employees in the US and Singapore. "Our core focus has
always been to optimize therapies to augment patient care and health
outcomes," said Kuldeep Singh Rajput, founder and CEO of Biofourmis.

"The past year was filled with exciting achievements as our team made
great strides in advancing our products, in addition to strengthening
our regulatory platform and signing contracts with numerous global
pharmaceutical firms. Our new funds will allow us to rapidly expand our
workforce and commercialization efforts, while further demonstrating the
clinical efficacy of our digital therapeutics platform through research
and development," Rajput added.

Biofourmis develops its product and treatment algorithms by running
randomized clinical trials, generating clinical data and demonstrating
safety and efficacy.

The deal marks Sequoia India's second growth stage deal this year, at a
time when it has been focusing more on early-stage investments, from its
own fund, as well from a dedicated accelerator programme for early stage
startups in India and Southeast Asia, called Surge.

Mint reported on April 11 that Sequoia led a $26 million round Mobile
analytics and marketing startup CleverTap, at a valuation of about $150
million. In April Sequoia also led a $35.5 million round in mobile
sports gaming startup Mobile Premier League (MPL).

Before the current slew of growth deals, it made a series of growth
investments in January, when it led a $25 million investment in online
insurance platform Turtlemint, and a $40 million round in ed-tech
startup Eruditus.

Health-tech startups have seen rising investor interest over the past
year, sectoral tailwinds such as increased internet penetration, rise in
digital payments and big-ticket government initiatives. Mint reported on
November 12 that health-tech startup funding has hit an all-time high of
$510 million, citing data from Tracxn Technologies.

These were led by medicine ordering website PharmEasy, which raised $115
million across three rounds this year. Other significant funding rounds
include fitness startup Curefit raising $100 million from IDG Ventures,
and online pharmacy Netmeds securing a $35 million round led by
Cambodian investor DPC Group.

The Journey Of A Startup Becoming A Brand

Business World

July 1, 2022

Length: 929 words

Byline: BW Online Bureau

Body

In the last decade, scalability and growth-hacking became the startup
mantras, setting off a race to capture customers and markets. On the
broader view, these could be viewed as short sprints, whereas pacing and
perseverance are most important in the race to being a sustainable
company.

Most startups begin with great ideas. The challenge, however, lies in
sustaining the growth and becoming a 'brand'. Only a handful of
early-stage companies think critically about the principles and the
tools they need to incorporate to build a sustainable and genuinely
successful company over time.

Most startups think 'campaigns' and forget about cultivating stickiness
in their audiences' minds. A 'brand' exists in the minds of its
audience. It is not just visibility or revenues but the culmination of
various intangible factors built on solid foundations.

A close observation of long-standing companies around the globe across
various sectors shows that several foundational elements contribute to
these companies' longevity and relevancy. These may include
customer-first principles, adaptable long-term strategies, and
scalability of leadership. The fact is - none of these need to adversely
impact short-term growth.

Creating A Value Framework For Societal Impact

If you are a startup, what are your core values? Not just the company's
mission statement or the challenge of breaking yet another milestone in
customer acquisition. What is your company's role in society or the
larger ecosystem, and how does it create real value for its customers.
These core values also guide goal-setting and the means to achieve those
goals.

These core values become the foundation of your communications -
internally and externally. It trickles down to every single employee who
carries your startup forward. For tech-oriented startups, this often
includes complex issues with AI, privacy and data security - parameters
where ethical considerations are foremost. In designing the end product,
many fail to consider the effects of their software products, services
and operations on society or their consumer. In the long term, this may
become a roadblock in their growth story.

Scalable Leadership

The vision of its founders drives a successful business. The founder of
a startup is synonymous with the company and its vision. The reputations
of several startups have floundered because of the actions of their
founders. WeWork, Uber, and Ola are some companies that come to mind in
recent times. As the primary

brand custodian, entrepreneurs are often reluctant to change their
approach or personality as the brand grows.

Emphasising vision and values, behaviours over intentions, and purpose
over task - this kind of commitment enables every employee to be a brand
custodian who can make decisions without oversight. A significant
milestone for founders is when they can build a strong team that runs
itself, freeing them up to further focus on the company culture, mission
and values.

Brand Speak - Always

Lack of constant and consistent communication is one of the biggest
failures of startups that failed to become brands. Consistent
communication with stakeholders and consumers is one of the top
priorities a startup must focus on right from the initial years. The
core values, mission, and vision must be communicated to internal and
external stakeholders.

Unfortunately, most startups do not consider PR and Communications until
they seek funding, by which time, a perception already exists in their
audiences' minds. Much of the marketing before this stage is focused on
customer acquisition or user engagement. Both are important, but the
fragmented approach leads to a fragmented image in the minds of its
stakeholders.

It is essential for a startup to consistently communicate beyond 'who we
are' or 'what are we selling'. Transparency in communications,
particularly post-COVID, is essential. It is vital to start building a
community of consumers and stakeholders early on with a clear and
defined strategy on what the startup wants to portray itself as and how
it wants to communicate with them. And most importantly, how it takes
feedback from its community.

An excellent example of community communications is OnePlus, founded by
Carl Pei and Pete Lau - which built and engaged a strong community and
fanbase early on and was known to take feedback and suggestions from the
audience and incorporate them into future products - this was hugely
satisfying for any invested consumer.

OnePlus barely advertised in its initial years - blowing away the myth
that communications to large audiences need to be expensive. The niche
approach, talking directly to customers via multiple avenues such as PR
stories, social media and forums, made them a favourite. Their customers
saw the value in the brand, invested, and eventually felt like they were
stakeholders in the brand.

Summary

A strong foundation is crucial to building a brand. Define the vision,
mission and core values. Remind yourself of it every time you
communicate - regardless of the medium. Consistency in communication
helps shape the narrative and keeps the startup on the right path -
reinforcing the required image to build a brand.

A consistent narrative resonates with your community and stakeholders.
This does not mean your company has to stay the same. Your customer
preferences will change with time, and your products and services will,
accordingly. This is possible through constant communication and
dialogue.

Failed twice, found success by making semi-automatic bike covers

Twenty-seven-year-old Keshav Rai was an average student in school, but
his keen interest in repairing things made him pursue engineering.
However, he soon got bored and decided to try his hands at
entrepreneurship.

While Keshav's first two startups were failures, he never gave up on
innovating and learning. After going through some difficult times, he
came up with the idea of starting a semi-automatic bike cover business.

Keshav started Bike Blazer in late 2016. It offers two-wheeler parking
covers that are water-resistant and protects vehicles from dust. The
handy device can be fixed on the vehicle and the overall operational
time of the cover is below 30 seconds, says Keshav.

Today, Bike Blazer is seeing an annual turnover of Rs 1.3 crore.

From running a dhaba to building a 33,000 sq yards resort

At the age of 13, Ankush Kakkar (now 38) took up the responsibility of
helping his father run his woollen shawl business in Ludhiana as the
family could not afford to hire a helper.

Recalling the old days, Ankush says the family had to struggle a lot and
he had to manage both his studies and help in the business.

However, he realised something needed to be done to make the business
financially stable. After three years, in 2000, the father-son duo
decided to set up a dhaba near Ludhiana bus stand. Ankush was in Class
XII and had acquired the skills to run the business.

"We got a patch of land to run a small dhaba where we would feed bus and
truck drivers. And within two to three years, we bought another property
to build a small hotel of 20 rooms," he recollects. One thing happened
after the other, and in 2006, Ankush and his father bought another hotel
in Ludhiana.

Going the extra mile and fighting tooth and nail to make his dream of
growing business come true, in 2020, Ankush built a 33,000 square yards
resort called Treeoise in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh.

Started from home to make ends meet, now a global rakhi brand

The journey of Shree Rakhi dates back to 1962 when Murli Dharji Mohta
was working as a clerk in an accounting firm in Kolkata, but was unable
to meet the family expenses. The times were hard, job opportunities were
scarce, and he did not even have enough money to start a business on his
own.

Seeing the family circumstances, his wife Pushi Devi Mohta decided to
make simple rakhis at home after seeing the significance of the festival
in the country. Though the investment required was little, a creative
sense was crucial to turning a simple thread into a beautiful piece that
would fascinate people to buy it.

"My nani (grandmother) started making rakhis at home to help my
grandfather, but suddenly, after two years, she passed away and the
business also got shut. But my grandfather didn't give up and so he
began the work again," Kamal tells SMBStory.

Mohta restarted the business in the fond memory of his wife, and his son
Jiwan Das Mohta carried the business forward. In 1979, Kamal joined his
uncle in the business and decided to make Shree Rakhi a renowned name in
the country.

"Earlier, we were selling rakhis without any branding and in an
unorganised way. When I joined, I thought that making a brand out of
rakhis would benefit us and so, we started labelling our rakhis as
'Shree Rakhi'," Kamal recalls.

Today, Shree Rakhi is a registered MSME that serves 700 districts across
the country. Kamal says the company follows a distribution model with a
network of 500 wholesalers and 2,000 retailers across India.

From a corporate career to building a home appliance brand

The growing internet penetration around 2015 was leading to the rise of
ecommerce in India. Sitting at Bain and Company in Gurugram, Bharat
Kalia mulled over consumer durables.

Bharat, who had been using the same home appliances used by his parents
for around 20-30 years, was convinced the consumer durables sector
needed a digital revamp.

"In 2015, there was so much development happening in mobiles and TVs,
but none in the home appliances and consumer durables space. These
legacy categories comprised supremely bulky and non-efficient methods of
production and distribution," he tells SMBStory.

Bharat decided to leave his cushy corporate job and take a leap into the
world of entrepreneurship and started Lifelong Online in Gurugram in
2015. He was joined by Bain & Company colleague Varun Grover and
entrepreneur Atul Raheja.

"I decided to start making these products according to their needs and
at price points that were honest and transparent," he adds.

Today, the 60-member team sees Rs 40 crore revenue in the peak months,
Bharat claims. Around 33 percent of the overall sales come from home and
kitchen appliances, one-third from grooming and sports products, and the
rest from its lifestyle and health category.

This couple scaled their handicraft products brand to sell
internationally

Until 2010, Nitin Pamnani was an award-winning documentary filmmaker. A
few years later, he, along with his wife Jia Pamnani, decided to leave
Mumbai and settle in his hometown, Gwalior.

Around the same time, the duo noticed that ecommerce was picking up
steam. They had several acquaintances who were dealing in handicraft and
handmade products. This compelled them to explore a business opportunity
in this segment. Investing Rs 30 lakh from their personal savings, they
started working on a platform that would sell artisanal products such as
home decor items, printed suit materials, bags, dupattas, neckpieces,
cushion covers, and more. In 2012, their project, called iTokri, finally
went live.

Nitin tells SMBStory that the company went through difficult times
between 2012 and 2016. Gwalior, unlike metros, was less developed and
lacked the infrastructure to support an ecommerce business.

With limited resources in hand, Nitin and Jia opened an office and a
warehouse facility in their home to launch the business. They initially
relied on local delivery mechanisms and partnered with Blue Dart in
2015. That is when the brand really took off.

With the number of freight companies on the rise and logistics
infrastructure expanding in and around the city, iTokri not just started
delivering pan-India but also exported to the US, the UK, Middle East,
and Europe.

Today, iTokri, which was started with 20 employees, has grown to become
a team of more than 200 members.

This rickshaw puller turned entrepreneur is now selling his product
globally

Dharambir Kamboj was in his early teens in the 1970s when the financial
hardships of the family forced him to stop studying.

Hailing from a village in Haryana, Dharambir looked after his family's
farm and herbal plantations, but that did not help him earn enough to
support his family and the medical treatment of his ailing mother and
sister.

Struggling to make ends meet, he moved to Delhi to find a job, but
eventually started ferrying people in a rickshaw. Here, he was surprised
to see people paying hefty amounts to buy processed fruit products from
Delhi's local markets, and this idea stayed with him.

After meeting with an accident, he returned to his village. Here, he did
a number of experiments related to organic farming. He also did
innovative work in mushroom farming, vermicomposting, and others and
wanted to extract aloe vera juice. Realising the exorbitant cost of the
machines, he decided to develop one in-house called the Multipurpose
Processing Machine.

Now, Dharambir is selling his patented machines to 15 countries and
making an annual revenue of Rs 67 lakh.

This couple built a Rs 15 Cr revenue business in 3 years

IIM Raipur graduate Anusha Chandrashekar was always passionate about the
fashion industry and dreamt of running her own women's western wear
brand. Her batchmate, Alok Paul, was interested in building ecommerce
businesses.

Not only did they marry each other but also married their interests.
They launched a direct-to-consumer (D2C) online women's western wear
brand Berrylush in Noida in 2018.

Starting with four machines and a small manufacturing setup, the couple
began manufacturing and selling apparel, including dresses, tops,
jumpsuits, and skirts on ecommerce platforms such as Myntra, Ajio,
Flipkart, Amazon, and their own website.

In two years, Berrylush has reached annual revenue of Rs 15 crore, the
brand claims, adding that it has sold over three lakh products in the 18
months preceding January 2021.

Selling products at Rs 5 and Rs 10, this brand caters to the masses

Prabhu Gandhikumar was working as a consultant in the US for many years
before he moved to India in 2012 to join his family business of
manufacturing metal castings in Coimbatore. He, however, felt a deep
sense of dissatisfaction.

In 2016, he explored various sectors he could venture into, and
beverages seemed like a good option. He realised that daily wage earners
yearned for carbonated drinks that were affordable yet tasty, especially
during summer months like April, May, and June.

Moreover, according to several data reports, a daily wage worker, on
average, earns between Rs 9,000-10,000 a month. Sometimes, even less.

Prabhu says he found a real gap in the market. Prabhu and his wife
Brindha Vijayakumar launched Tanvi Foods, focusing only on beverages, in
2016 with two flavours - mango and apple juice priced at Rs 10.

There was no looking back since, and the company later got converted
into TABP Snacks and Beverages in 2018. According to the numbers shared
by Prabhu, TABP has grown from clocking Rs 92 lakh in FY17 to Rs 35.5
crore in FY21.

Quitting a job in the US, he bought 20 cows and made a dairy brand

Like many of his peers born in middle-class families, Kishore Indukuri
aspired to study and work in the US.

The IIT Kharagpur graduate's ambitions became a reality after he
completed his Master's and PhD in Polymer Science and Engineering from
the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and took up a job at Intel.

However, six years into his job, Kishore realised his real passion was
agriculture.

His family back in India owned some land in Karnataka, and Kishore used
to join them in visiting the fields and interacting with farmers.

He says, "I decided to quit my job and return to my agricultural roots.
Moving back to Hyderabad, I realised there were limited options for
affordable, unadulterated milk. I wanted to bring a change not only for
my son and my family but also for the people of Hyderabad."

This inspired him to start his own dairy farm and milk brand. In 2012,
he bought 20 cows from Coimbatore and set up a dairy farm in Hyderabad.
Kishore started supplying milk directly to consumers in the city on a
subscription basis, and his business began to grow.

In 2016, the brand was officially registered as Sid's Farm (named after
Kishore's son Siddharth). Now, the 120-employee brand delivers milk to
over 10,000 customers daily, and achieved Rs 44 crore turnover last
year, Kishore claims.

Quitting CA to start a jewellery business

Chartered Accountancy is a challenging undertaking, with aspirants
spending several years to clear the exams. For Aditi Garg, founder of
jewellery label Adwitiya Collection, her CA journey led her to find
success in entrepreneurship.

"I was attempting to clear my CA, but it was becoming more difficult
with each passing year," Aditi tells SMBStory while recounting her
journey.

"Without clearing CA finals, no one would have given me the job and I
had started developing feelings that I am too much dependent on my
family. This is when I thought about starting a side business of
artificial jewellery and becoming financially self-sustainable," she
adds.

Aditi started as a reseller of jewellery in 2013. Building a micro-level
side business is what gave her the confidence and financial independence
to dream bigger. She started selling jewellery online through Amazon and
Flipkart. Her business was giving her good profits but she couldn't give
her 100 percent to the business as she was also focussing on clearing
her CA finals.

Four years passed and the Rs 17,000 worth inventory that Aditi had
bought from the wholesaler to start the business was still stuck with
her. Neither was she able to clear her CA nor did she carry forward her
business consistently.

In 2018, Aditi decided to quit her CA to scale the business. She first
listed her jewellery under the brand name Adwitiya Collection.

This was the time when Myntra was also aggressively onboarding new
brands. Aditi grabbed this opportunity to push Adwitiya onto an
ecommerce marketplace.

"I listed my brand on Myntra and on the first day got around 25 orders.
That was a big number for me back then as I had never got such a big
order before."

Fast forward three years, Adwitiya now generates 90 percent of its sales
from Myntra where it gets around 350-400 orders a day. Aditi claims the
company expects to close FY 21-22 at Rs 5 crore in sales. This festive
season, Adwitiya Collection got 9,000 orders and raked in Rs 75 lakh in
sales.

The Internet of Things has become a game changer in today's world and is
playing a vital role in the industrial revolution. This article explores
the uses of IoT in healthcare systems, water supply, recycling systems
and many other areas.

The Internet of Things (IoT) could be a game changer for India, but the
country is lagging far behind China in its adoption. Today, the IoT is
transforming industrial revolution. An IIoT factory can yield 5-12.5%
cost reduction in operation and optimisation, 10-40% cost savings in
predictive maintenance and 20-50% cost reduction in inventory
optimisation.

To boost IoT concepts, Indian technology giant Wipro announced the
launch of industrial IoT Center Of Excellence (COE) in Kochi, Kerala on
March 14, 2019. According to Wipro, this COE aims at developing
innovative solutions for customers in industrial manufacturing,
automotive, healthcare and pharmacy. COE aims at developing
customer-ready IoT solutions.

Innovations needed for IoT industries

Innovation leads, the world follows. With the rise in the Indian Startup
Ecosystem, innovation has reached its peak in the country with 45,444
patent applications filled in 2016-17 alone.

Today, a lot of IoT related startups are coming and working in India.
They are deliberately taking advantage of the Internet to enhance the
abilities of the devices. The devices may be lighting system, entry into
home, water sprinklers used for irrigation in agriculture, traffic
control system, vehicles, road lighting systems and many more. In a
smart city, electric transmission, billing and the security of various
services such as banks, ATMs, hotels, etc, are all done through
IoT-operated devices. Dealing with IoT related projects by companies and
startups is offering great challenges.

Vyuti is a visual object intelligence provider for the manipulation of
objects by robotic arms. It can pick, orient and place objects in
various locations. With adequate training, the solutions can be applied
in sectors like manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and
warehousing. Today, there are many solutions in the market for object
recognition. Funded by N.A. Gokul, Vyuti is in talks with TVS, AMS and
Sansera.

Numocity is working with the electric vehicle ecosystem. It aims in
connecting battery, charging stations, etc, via a transaction engine,
distributed ledger and an artificial intelligence (AI) based engine.
Founded by Ravikiran Annasamy, Numocity was a member of Bosch's DNA 2.0
Cohort in 2018.

Areas benefitting through IoT

While India is considered to be the fourth largest home for startups,
the failure rates are also very high here due to many factors including
difficulties in managing the ventures.

The hundred billion dollars Indian healthcare industry is set for
revolution. Big data, IoT and AI will shape the future of this new
ecosystem.

Increased entry of affordable IoT devices and rising consumer
expectations are driving the rapid growth of the IoT market. The IoT
market in India is expected to reach 15 billion dollars by 2020,
accounting for nearly five per cent of the total global market. With
nearly 120 firms offering solutions in the IoT segment today, there are
tremendous opportunities for further growth.

Smart lifestyles, embedded homes, buildings, healthcare and
manufacturing are key sectors in India for IoT startups. Investors are
now showing more interest in IoT startups with a cumulative investment
of more than sixty million dollars since 2014. The top four areas of
funding are: lifestyle/wearables, embedded computing, industrial
Internet and connected homes.

Today, various operations of the city such as traffic, electricity,
water, waste management, and much more are done on IoT platforms.
Samsung R&D Institute in Bengaluru, Nasscom, Intel and L&T together have
announced the formation of Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) India
Ecosystem Task Force to increase awareness about global IoT standards
and their benefits for the Indian IoT industry.

IoT based systems for water supply and water recycling

Increasing dependence on ground water as a reliable source of water in
rural areas of India has resulted in unlimited extraction of water.
Without considering the research of aquifers as well as other
environmental factors, ground water source may be threatened. IoT based
systems can even help to utilise waste water at malls, flats, etc. Not
less than 380,000 litres of water is recycled at Orion mall, Bengaluru
every day based on an IoT based system.

Greenvironment India is an environmental engineering company incubated
at IIT Chennai, offering smart water and waste water management
solutions for residential companies/apartments, commercial
establishments, institutions and industries.

instrument to measure pH, residual chlorine, ORP, Ozone etc (Credit:
processinstruments.co.uk)

IoT based smart sensor solutions on the cloud can monitor pH, Flow, DO
(dissolved oxygen ), ORP (oxidation reduction potential), TDS (total
dissolved salts), level, pressure, temperature of water during water
supply. It can keep automatic records of the above parameters and send
alerts over email or SMS.

Smart water management systems in multi-specialty hospitals are helping
to reduce hundred litres/person/head resulting in 20-30 per cent water
conservation. Today, in 172 apartments of Chennai, dependency on an
external supply of water is greatly reduced by producing good-quality
recycled water for 55 per cent of the communities living here using an
efficient IoT based system. This has resulted in saving of thirty per
cent of overall water costs.

Effects of IoT based wearables in the healthcare system

The market size for wearables had reached 25 billion dollars by the end
of 2019. Currently, wearable technologies are considered as an integral
part of IoT based projects and include smartwatches, fitness bands, and
even AR/VR headsets.

The smart contact lens is one of the most anticipated medical IoT
technologies. Pharmaceutical giant Novartis teamed up with Google to
build this revolutionary device that promises to help patients with
diabetes by measuring their glucose levels as well as assisting those
with eye problems. The smart contact lens looks like a regular contact
lens, but it comes with a sensor that can track the blood sugar level of
the user non-invasively through the tears and correct vision in a new
innovative way. The project was initially designed by Google X.

The lens contains a tiny and ultra-slim microchip that is embedded in
one of its thin concave sides. Through its equally tiny antenna, it will
send data about glucose measurements from the user's tears to his or her
paired smartphone via installed software. This technology has got the
potential to lower the cost of managing the chronic disease and
encourage people to get involved in managing their health digitally.

To sum up

IoT is an emerging field of Internet technology. It is a field of
research and innovation concerned with increasing the abilities of
devices on the Internet scale. Ordinary rules of operating devices no
longer apply here. Basically, here the Internet leaves its classical
realm and enters a new world of control of devices mechanism.

The scientific community, policy makers, apex bodies and funding
agencies are continuously striving to progress in various areas of IoT.
In the last two decades, India has achieved many milestones in the areas
of IoT and many are yet to be achieved.

lecturer in mechanical department for ten years in three different
polytechnics. He is also a freelance writer and cartoonist.

Remembering the startups we lost in 2022

It's been a year. This roundup is never a particularly fun one to write.
No one wants to see startups fail, but we're all keenly aware that most
ultimately do. A commonly cited figure suggest that 90% of these
companies will ultimately fail. But even with that in mind, 2022 just
hit different.

The previous two years were unprecedented in startup land, of course.
Some startups blossomed and others struggled amid shutdowns and job
losses. Then came the rise and fall of the SPAC wave and global supply
issues. Now it's the economy, stupid. According to figures from
Crunchbase, Q3 venture capital dropped a mind-boggling 33% from last
quarter and 53% from the same time last year. The days of the $20
million seed round appear to be over - at least for now. It is, frankly,
a bad time to be raising and, by extension, a bad time to be running an
early-stage startup. Accordingly, this year saw a lot of startups
pumping the brakes or pulling the plug. As such, this is by no means a
comprehensive list. And with the continued spiral of the crypto firm, it
seems we're not out of the woods yet. With all of that in mind, let's
take a look at some of the startups that didn't make it. Airlift, once
one of Pakistan's most richly valued and funded startups, shut down in
July due to lack of capital and an unsuccessful attempt to close a
funding round. Before that, the commerce service platform raised $85
million in the country's largest Series B funding, at a valuation of
$275 million. The fall from those heights, thus, didn't just impact
employees and investors, but also general enthusiasm about the Pakistani
tech ecosystem. It wasn't from lack of interest - or money. Argo AI had
the support of two of the world's largest carmakers: Volkswagen and
Ford. Founded in 2016 by Google and Uber vets, the Pittsburgh-based firm
managed to drum up $1 billion in funding over its half-dozen-year
existence. Back in October, however, management dropped a bombshell
during an all-hands: Argo was shutting down. The technology and some
employees would be absorbed into either Ford or VW, and the rest of its
2,000+ employees would be getting severance. Ultimately, it seems, the
company failed to bring on new investors and drum up additional funds
from existing backers. The dream of autonomous driving certainly isn't
going away any time soon, and both automakers want to get there, whether
via in-house development or third-party acquisition. Unfortunately,
however, Argo won't be around to play a part. Fast, a startup that
provided online checkout products, announced in early April that it
would shut down after days of chatter that its future was in doubt.
Apparently, its 2021 revenue growth was modest - just six figures - and
its cash burn was high, with no fundraising prospects in sight. The
company - founded by Domm Holland and Allison Barr Allen - was one of
those that had plenty of hype around it, so its demise (especially after
raising $124.5 million in three years) caused quite a ripple in the
startup world. Notably, as it imploded, the company described itself as
a "trailblazer," saying that not all such parties make it to "the
mountain top," claiming that while it failed, the startup managed to
"forever" change the world of online commerce. While the debacle paled
in comparison to what would come later in the year when it came to
overly confident leaders (ahem, see below), it was perhaps one of the
earliest signs that all was not as rosy as it appeared in fintech land.
We debated on whether to include cryptocurrency exchange FTX as it
technically has not shut down. But as one staffer pointed out, "We
certainly lost it as the company it was." The once-third-largest crypto
exchange FTX on November 11 filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and
announced that CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried had resigned from his
role. That news came days after a week-long collapse of the FTX empire
as the company attempted to keep itself afloat, seeking acquisitions and
fresh capital from market players. By December 12, Bankman-Fried had
been arrested in the Bahamas. The next day, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) had officially charged Bankman-Fried with
defrauding investors. The demise of the once-high-flying startup, which
had raised nearly $2 billion in funding and once appeared to be flush
with cash, no doubt marked a very low point for the crypto space. For
now, Enron turnaround veteran John J. Ray III is serving as FTX's new
CEO, reportedly making $1,300 an hour. Other crypto companies that also
filed for bankruptcy this year but also technically did not shut down
include Celsius and BlockFi. Haus, a direct-to-consumer aperitif
business backed by the likes of Casey Neistat, Homebrew Ventures and
Coatue, shuttered earlier this year. What was surprising was that Haus
announced this shift after it crossed the $10 million in revenue
threshold and announced that it would be hitting national distribution
with Winebow - two markers of growth. Instead, the company's eventual
demise was triggered by an investor kerfuffle. Haus CEO and co-founder
Helena Hambrecht said that Constellation committed to leading the
startup's $10 million Series A, and even offered to advance the startup
money as runway began to dwindle. Then, last minute, Constellation
backed out of the deal without any specific reasoning other than
"timing," she says. The co-founder said "there's no villain" in the
shutdown story, yet Constellation's dropout shows another example of how
difficult it is to be a venture-backed, direct-to-consumer company.
Proving that home automation can be a tough nut to crack, Insteon
abruptly shut down in mid-April 2022, turning off its cloud servers
without giving customers any warning. Launched by startup SmartLabs in
2005, Insteon at one point had an agreement with Microsoft to sell its
kits at Microsoft Store locations and was one of the two launch partners
for Apple's HomeKit platform, with the HomeKit-enabled Insteon Hub Pro.
Insteon for the first few days didn't respond to questions about the
shutdown and its CEO, Rob Lilleness, deleted his LinkedIn account.
Subsequently, however, the company updated its website with a statement
that blamed the sudden liquidation on pandemic and supply chain
problems. Apparently - if the unattributed statement is to be believed,
at least - the goal was to find a parent for Insteon. But while a sale
was expected in March, the plans ultimately fell through. Insteon's
proprietary protocol likely didn't do it any favors. More widely
compatible technologies like Zigbee, Z-Wave and Matter are licensable
and widely adopted, giving Insteon little in the way of leverage. Kite,
a startup developing an AI-powered coding assistant, shut down in
November despite securing tens of millions of dollars in venture capital
backing. Kite struggled to pay the bills, founder Adam Smith revealed in
a postmortem blog post, running into engineering headwinds that made
finding a product-market fit essentially impossible. "We failed to
deliver our vision of AI-assisted programming because we were 10+ years
too early to market, i.e., the tech is not ready yet," Smith said. "Our
product did not monetize, and it took too long to figure that out."
Kite's failure doesn't necessarily bode well for the other companies
pursuing - and attempting to commercialize - generative AI for coding.
Smith estimated that it could cost over $100 million to build a
"production-quality" tool capable of synthesizing code reliably. That
said, Kite's rivals, including GitHub, Tabnine and DeepCode, believe
it's premature to become bearish on the market. Kitty Hawk had
understandably high hopes when it launched in 2010. Founded by and
piloted by self-driving car pioneer Sebastian Thrun, the eVTOL maker had
some prominent backers, including, most notably, Google co-founder,
Larry Page. In September, the startup announced its closure courtesy of
a curt tweet, noting, "We have made the decision to wind down Kittyhawk.
We're still working on the details of what's next." What comes next
still isn't entirely clear. Plenty of folks remain bullish on the eVTOL
category, but Kitty Hawk couldn't stick the landing. After flying 111 of
its crafts a total of 25,000 flights, the firm shuttered that specific
program, ultimately resulting in 70 layoffs. Further progress was made,
"by 2022, however, the mission was less clear," as Kirsten notes in her
news report. A  commercial air taxi was apparently still in the works by
the time the company began winding down operations in September. In late
June, Modsy, on online interior design services startup, abruptly ceased
offering design services, laid off its designers and left customers with
unfinished renovations and project orders in process. By July, Modsy had
shut down entirely - a surprising turn of events for a startup that
raised $72.7 million from investors including Comcast Ventures and
NBCUniversal. So what went wrong? Modsy took a major bottom-line hit on
the logistics side during the pandemic as global supply chains ground to
a halt. Amanda Kwan-Rosenbush, the former senior director of finance and
accounting at Modsy, described shipping as a "significant cost" and said
that Modsy's furniture and décor partners often struggled with long
delays. But the e-design platform space is a tough nut to crack. Rivals
like Laurel & Wolf and Homepolish shuttered in 2019, while Décor Aid, a
smaller company, closed up shop in 2021. Modsy made a series of
aggressive cuts two years prior to its shutdown, slashing designer pay
and reducing both salaried employees and its network of designers.
Business of Home's reporting revealed that the startup - in addition to
piloting its own furniture line - at one point experimented with
outsourcing design work to the Philippines and Bulgaria as a way to
reduce operating expenses. But the pivots weren't enough in the end to
prevent Modsy's demise.  NopeaRide, Kenya's first fully electric vehicle
service, shut down in November after scaling to 70 vehicles and building
a charging network all across Nairobi. It closed after parent company
EkoRent Oy was unable to raise additional funding. The closure came
after the startup raised an undisclosed amount of funding since its 2018
launch. It was seeking to build more solar charging hubs in Nairobi and
expand the radius in which it operated within. Some startup failures are
unexpected from the outside. Others you can see coming from a mile away.
In spite of once sharing a blog post titled, "Contrary to popular
belief, we are not dead," Onward Mobility wasn't fooling anyone. The
Austin-based firm entered the mobile scene with an already risky
proposition: bringing the BlackBerry back once again. The titular firm
behind the original line struggled for years and TCL's revival didn't
last particularly long. Onward promised things would be different this
time. It announced its intentions to the world, fell completely silent
for some time and less than two years later, admitted that rumors of its
death were no longer greatly exaggerated. That news arrived
approximately one month after the company was publicly insisting
otherwise. It's frankly extremely hard to launch a brand new company
even when there isn't a global pandemic. And it seems like a fairly safe
bet that, 15 years after the first iPhone turned the market upside down,
there just isn't enough of an appetite in the U.S. to serve as the
foundation of a brand new phone maker. Real estate fintech startup Reali
began its shutdown in August in a surprise move, considering it had just
raised $100 million one year prior. After a boom in home buying, the
real estate tech sector found itself struggling as inflation and
mortgage interest rates climbed, leading to a major slowdown in the
housing market. Even as it was winding down, Reali described itself as
"one of the pioneering companies to offer the 'buy before you sell' and
'cash offer' programs to homeowners." It seems that even being a pioneer
doesn't guarantee success and the news left us - and our readers -
wondering how companies can burn through so much cash, so fast.
India-based ShopX filed for bankruptcy in August after failing to
generate enough cash flow and running into challenges raising capital.
The startup, which provided software to connect brands, retailers and
in-person shoppers, had raised over $66 million in funding from Fung
Group, NB Ventures and others, and was last valued at about $175
million.  ShopX competed mainly with business-to-business vendors such
as 1K Kirana Bazaar and SuperK but ventured into the
business-to-consumer space in 2021, offering incentives - including cash
back and cash-saving offers - to customers while they browsed their
neighborhood kirana shops. (In India, "kirana" are small independently
owned shops that make up a major part of India's physical retail
economy.) ShopX also rewarded purchases on select bike and car-related
services, salon visits, grocery, medicines and more. Edtech has had a
rough year. That rings especially true for Udayy, which shut down after
raising millions from investors, reported the Economic Times. The Indian
edtech sold live learning courses to kids, a use case that isn't as
bright as it used to be. As Natasha has said in the past, we now know
that the startups that most enjoyed a pandemic-era boom are now the same
startups facing difficult questions about how to navigate a
not-so-looming downturn. The same venture capital rounds that allowed
companies to expand their idea of what a total addressable market could
look like, are the same tranches that may have forced an overspending
and overhiring spree that now requires a correction.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the Q2 and H1
FY '23 Earnings Conference Call of Eris Lifesciences Limited.

We have with us on the call today, Mr. Amit Bakshi, Chairman and
Managing Director; and Mr. V. Krishnakumar, Chief Operating Officer and
Executive Director. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this
conference is being recorded.

I now hand the conference over to Mr. V. Krishnakumar, Chief Operating
Officer and Executive Director of the company. Thank you, and over to
you, sir.

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR & COO, ERIS LIFESCIENCES
LIMITED: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to our earnings call for
the second quarter of financial year '23. I'm Krishnakumar, and I'll be
sharing the highlights of this quarter and the first half of the year
over you.

Oaknet, our recent acquisition in the month of May 2002 is emerging as a
clear success story in value creation through M&A. Oaknet's growth
momentum continues with quarter 2 revenue of INR 68 crores and EBITDA of
INR 16.5 crores, which represents an EBITDA margin of more than 24%.

We are tracking to deliver an EBITDA of INR 50 crores from Oaknet in
this financial year. Just to recap a bit. We had acquired Oaknet as part
of our strategic entry into the dermatology segment.

Our thesis was that Oaknet brings in 2 strategic assets: firstly, a
strong portfolio in medical dermatology with brands such as Cosvate and
Cosmelite; and secondly, a good presence in the specialty with a
coverage of 11,000 dermatologists across the country.

Oaknet had a revenue base of INR 195 crores with an EBITDA of INR 20
crores when we went into the business. Our target was to build the
business and achieve an EBITDA of INR 50 crores in 2 years' time, that
is in FY '24.

Accordingly, we set in various motions -- various levers in motion of
execution excellence, including, firstly, realignment of the divisional
focus with specific product portfolios and doctor specialties to
maximize growth impetus and minimize overlap.

Secondly, we expanded the bandwidth of the senior team. Thirdly, we
digitized the entire field force and got them onto Eris' proprietary
Digital Marketing platform to enhance productivity. And fourthly, we saw
an expansion of the dermatologist coverage from 60% to 90% in just 3
months.

We also kick-started the investment cycle in the business by launching
strategic products such as Dydrogesterone and FCM injection in the
gynecology division. And we also lined up an interesting pipeline in
dermatology and cosmetology for launch starting this month.

A few months into this deal, our growth thesis has been more than
reconfirmed with the business having delivered a revenue of INR 100
crores in a period of just 4.5 months with Eris. We are now tracking to
deliver an EBITDA of INR 50 crores in financial year '23, which is 1
full year ahead of our expectations at the time of the deal
announcement.

Now moving to the growth numbers. As per AWACS, Eris delivered a growth
of 19.3% in quarter 2 of this year versus a market growth of 13%. This
is on the back of an 8% growth delivered by Eris in quarter 1 versus a
market growth of 2%. Hence, on a half year basis, Eris has delivered a
growth of 13.6% versus the market growth of 7.4%.

We have now entered an era where we have clear visibility on secular
growth over the next 3 years. Let us begin with our Cardio-Metabolic
segment, which accounts for 53% of our revenue. This market has bounced
back with a 14.6% growth in quarter 2, after having gone through a
onetime correction of 4% growth in the preceding 4 quarters.

Eris has registered a Q2 growth of 21.8% in this segment, which is 720
basis points ahead of the market. In the last 6 quarters, our
cardio-metabolic business has grown at a 12% CAGR compared to the market
growth of 5%, once again, a lead of 700 basis points.

We expect that the cardio-metabolic market will be able to sustain a
mid-to-early teen growth rate over the next 3 years with 5% to 6% growth
coming in from new products, 4% to 5% growth coming in from price
increases and 3% to 4% growth coming from volumes.

We expect that Eris will continue growing ahead of this market by a
healthy margin on account of several exciting growth drivers, including
patent expirations and new product opportunities in the DPP-4 and SGLT2
segments, growth from our insulin Glargine and GLP1 segments and patent
expirations in the Heart Failure segment.

Secondly, let's talk about our 3 emerging therapies: dermatology, CNS
and women's health, which collectively account for 21% of our total
revenue. Our portfolio in these segments has achieved critical mass with
combined annual revenue of INR 420 crores as per AWACS.

This portfolio has registered a growth of 25.3% in quarter 2 of this
year versus a market growth of 15.8%, which represents a lead of 950
basis points. Over the last 6 quarters, this portfolio has registered a
CAGR of 25% versus the market growth of 14%. This represents a lead of
1,100 basis points.

We expect that Eris will continue growing ahead of the market by a
meaningful margin on account of several growth drivers, including new
launches in dermatology and cosmetology.

Secondly, a force multiplying that is in play in the women's health
therapy with more than 470 reps in the market across 2 divisions in Eris
as well as Oaknet; expansion of specialist coverage across the board;
and potential inorganic opportunities.

Zomelis, our Vildagliptin Mother Brand group continues to sustain its
growth trajectory with a monthly run rate of INR 9.3 crores in
September. This represents an increase of INR 1 crore in monthly run
rate from the June figure of INR 8.3 crores. With this, the Zomelis
Mother Brand has grown 9x, 9 fold, in less than 3 years from
acquisition.

In yet another milestone, Gluxit, our Dapagliflozin Mother Brand group
has achieved a monthly run rate of INR 5.1 crores in September 22, which
represents an increase of INR 1.2 crores in monthly run rate from the
June figure of INR 3.9 crores.

Key new products launched in this quarter include Glura, which is our
brand of Sitagliptin; Gluxit S, which is a combination of Dapagliflozin
and Sitagliptin; and Raricap FCM in the women's health therapy for the
treatment of iron deficient anemia.

We have an interesting set of new product launches coming up in Q3 as
well, including Xglar, which is our brand of Glargine in license from
Biocon this month.

Coming to the financials. Our stand-alone operating revenue amounted to
INR 355 crores this quarter, which represents a growth of 10%
year-on-year. The stand-alone operating revenue for the first half of
this year stood at INR 684 crores, which is a growth of 9%.

Our stand-alone gross margin in Q2 stood at 80.2% versus 82% last
quarter, which is down by 180 basis points moving to a higher incidence
of new products this quarter. The impact of industry-wide raw material
cost escalation in our portfolio continues to remain minimal.

With the addition of nearly 200 MRs since the start of the year, our
stand-alone YPM stood at INR 5.3 lakh this quarter, up from INR 5 lakhs
last quarter.

Stand-alone EBITDA for the quarter stood at INR 141 crores, which
represents an EBITDA margin of 39.7% versus 38.4% in quarter 1.
Stand-alone net profit for the quarter stood at INR 115 crores, which
represents a profit after-tax margin of 32.4%, and this includes Oaknet
related impact on treasury income and finance costs.

Our consolidated operating revenue for the quarter was INR 461 crores,
which represents a growth of 28% year-on-year. The consolidated
operating revenue for the first half of this year grew by 21% to INR 859
crores.

Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter stood at INR 151 crores, and EBITDA
margin stood at 33%. Consolidated profit after tax for the quarter stood
at INR 119 crores, which represents a margin of 26%. This is inclusive
of all Oaknet related impact on depreciation, treasury income and
finance costs.

The overall margin profile for the first half of this year is in line
with our expectations given that FY '23 is a year of unprecedented
investments, including the launch of our insulin business, the
amalgamation of Oaknet acquisition, addition of a field force of 200
people, launch of significant new products across therapies and
commissioning of a new manufacturing facility in Gujarat.

Our Gujarat facility is on track to commence commercial operations in
January of this -- January of 2023. The total CapEx outlay for the
facility is to the tune of INR 170 crores to INR 180 crores, of which
INR 150 crores has been invested till date.

Inclusive of Oaknet, we are targeting a consolidated revenue growth of
30% and a consolidated EBITDA growth of 16% to 17% in this financial
year.

These were the highlights for the quarter. We are now happy to open up
for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question is from the line of
Kunal Dhamesha from Macquarie.

KUNAL DHAMESHA, RESEARCH ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Just a couple of
questions. One, the logistics question on the depreciation and
amortization, which has increased by roughly INR 5 crores - INR 6 crores
this quarter on a sequential basis. Is this the sustainable run rate
given now we will have Oaknet amortization included?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: The second quarter represents the full
impact, because what happens is the Oaknet acquisition cost of INR 650
crores, right, so that is getting amortized over 20 years. So INR 30
crores per year is the rough depreciation and amortization expense from
Oaknet alone. And the full impact of that is taken in quarter 2. So I
would say the answer to your question is yes.

KUNAL DHAMESHA: And secondly, within our, let's say, antidiabetic pie,
what would be right now, sulfonylurea, DPP-4 and SGLT2? And how does
that compare to, let's say, overall Indian antidiabetic -- oral
antidiabetic market?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: So for us, the presence of DPP-4 and SGLT2 is
about 35% to 40%, right? For the IPM, this percentage is slightly higher
because the IPM number includes the patented molecules as well. So the
IPM number will include EMPA. It will include EMPA, LINA. It will also
include a Sitagliptin patented. So for us this number from the new age
molecules is higher than many of our peers, but it is still catching up
with the IPM.

KUNAL DHAMESHA: And when I look at the stand-alone growth, which is like
10% year-on-year basis, right, for us. And if I look at some of the
secondary sales number that you have put in, we are kind of growing
faster than almost -- in almost all the therapies that we are present.
But then why would you say this not getting reflected in the primary
number for us?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: So there are a couple of reasons for this
Kunal. And I mean, you're -- I'm sure you understand that on a
quarter-on-quarter basis, it is a little challenging to see parity
between internal numbers and AWACS' numbers. But when we have seen the
average for the last 4 quarters or the last 6 quarters, then the
difference narrows down quite a bit. You still have a 2%-3% difference,
but it is not as stark as what we see in quarter 2. So we believe that
this difference will iron itself out over a period of time.

There is also a second driver, and I think this is something that we'll
continue to see at least for the next 3 quarters, which is that there
are quite a few products in the category where there is some legal thing
going on, where I don't want to go into too much detail. But these are
stocks that are lying in the market which are selling.

So these come into the secondary sales, but we don't necessarily get any
primary sales out of it. So this is also a contributing factor. So it is
a mix of factors. But as I said, if you look at it over a long enough
time frame, then these differences tend to iron themselves out.

KUNAL DHAMESHA: But the secondary sales that are for those products
would have come into the primary sales earlier, right?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: Yes, they did. But I mean they didn't come in
this quarter. So that is the challenge, right? You're seeing a 10%
primary and a 19% secondary in this quarter. So the difference is very
stark. And that is where I understand this question comes from. Because
a 3%-4% difference is something that you will have in every quarter.

KUNAL DHAMESHA: So basically those are as of now discontinued products
from your side?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: I wouldn't say discontinued, but on hold
pending resolution, I would say.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The next question is from the line of
Tushar Manudhane from Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

TUSHAR MANUDHANE, RESEARCH ANALYST, MOTILAL OSWAL SECURITIES LIMITED,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a good set of numbers. Just with the
stand-alone level, as I see the year-on-year growth is still 10%, where
the industry growth is little better than this. So that was one part.

And secondly, even the EBITDA margin is kind of slipping down from 41%
to 39%. So if you could share a comment on where we lost it.

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: Sure. I mean on the stand-alone side, there
are a couple of factors that will come into play, which are not visible
yet. I think one is that both the quarter 4 of last year and quarter 1
of this year, they have been very busy quarters in terms of new product
launches. But these launches will gain scale and they will gain momentum
in the quarters to come. So that is one aspect that will start showing
itself up in the stand-alone numbers going forward.

The second aspect is, corresponding to whatever inflationary trends that
we are seeing, we have been allowed to take price increases starting
April, but these price increases will also start manifesting themselves
only in the second half of the year, because unless we run out the
existing stock in the market, the price increase effect also doesn't
come into play.

So these 2 factors will start having a bearing on the stand-alone growth
going forward. That is one part.

The second question was about the stand-alone EBITDA margin. So this is
completely driven of COGS, because every time we launch a new product it
comes to us at a lower gross margin. So the corporate average gross
margin, excluding the new products continues to be at around 83%-84%,
right? But when a new product comes in at a 70% gross margin, for
example, it dilutes the COGS by 2% to 3% points for that quarter.

But when these products scale up, when we take the production in-house,
we have seen that over a period of time, Zomelis, Gluxit, they've all
followed this trajectory. So that is the reason why you see a dip in the
gross margin, which is temporary, and that deep in the gross margin is
reflected in the EBITDA margin.

TUSHAR MANUDHANE: Just lastly, while you relate to [Remylin] related
price hike, I mean, looking further have a positive effect on the growth
going forward, the kind of traction which you are having on the -- such
as Zomelis and Gluxit set of products and despite that, if the
year-on-year growth is so effectively 10% as I see on the stand-alone
level. So somewhere in the base portfolio, are we seeing relatively
lower traction and any particular comment out there, and any -- a big
effort to drive the growth in the base portfolio?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: See, the base portfolio anyway took a big hit
with where the market was for the last 4 quarters, right? I mean, before
Q2, we know that, and we have discussed it before and we've all
speculated on the reasons as to why is the cardio-metabolic market
growth down to 4%. So I think there were a couple of things, right?

One is that, before our 3 emerging therapies, derma, neuro and women's
health have scaled up, now they are like 1/5 of our revenue, which is a
good place for us to be in. But till not very long ago, our company was
basically being driven off 2 engines, basically diabetes and cardio. So
our fortunes were totally tied to how these markets were behaving.

So the market in cardio-metabolic is just coming back now. We've had 3
or 4 months of straight secular growth. And as we see when the market
takes a beating, some of the brands take a disproportionate beating,
that's something that we've seen over a period of time.

So with the market correcting, I would say that most of the brands, I
think products like Zomelis and Gluxit will continue growing at very
fast rates. Then we have products like Telmisartan, Olmesartan,
Rosuvastatin, which will be in the 10% to 12% per annum growth category.

And then lastly, we have the sulfonylureas like -- within Glimerpiride
we have Glimisave MV, which is growing very fast. But the traditional
Glimerpiride plus metformin, that will be more like a 6% to 7% growth
market. So going forward, that is the kind of numbers that we see.

So to the extent that we continue getting into more and more of the
gliptins and gliflozins, and there are heart failure products coming up
starting January, the overall growth traction should improve.

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI, CHAIRMAN & MD, ERIS LIFESCIENCES LIMITED: Yes.
And also -- Tushar? And also Tushar, the growth in this quarter from an
AWACS point of view is distributed across. It is very difficult to
choose. You look at it at any therapy, even at the brand level, the
growth is quite secular this time.

Though we believe that this could be a little bit of an exaggeration
from a growth perspective. But as KK rightly said, 3 months is not a
good time to look at. 1 month or 3 months is not a good time. We have
seen over the years by the end of the year, it basically tapers down to
a level which is acceptable.

And then remember what KK told, we are -- we will be having a 300 bps to
400 bps difference accounting to products, which we sell in -- which
sell in the market, but we don't get any primary pot. This will continue
till August next year. That is our clear understanding.

TUSHAR MANUDHANE: And just lastly on Oaknet, now that again already in
the sense 1 year ahead of meeting the target of INR 50 crore EBITDA. So
if you could just further extend how do we see FY '24, which is maybe
like 6 months down the line. If you could further elaborate on the
efforts to be taken on the FY '24 and onwards EBITDA for Oaknet...

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: Yes. So Tushar, we are happy with Oaknet. You
could imagine a lot of work wouldn't have gone in 2 quarters or not even
2 quarters yet. So it is just the structural changes which we have got
at this point of time, which has given some kind of positive bias.

We are quite hopeful about this business. I think that our thesis for
the business, as we are progressing is changing. So now we are thinking
about a 30% range kind of EBITDA in the time to come. So we have kind of
upward revised our numbers, both of the top line as well as the bottom
line, because -- and it will always happen, Tushar. Because, look, INR 3
lakh YPM is a very sensitive point or a sweet spot. You can choose to
whatever like. Sweet, because after INR 3 lakhs, whatever growth comes,
most of it falls into EBITDA.

So the journey from INR 3 lakh to INR 5 lakh YPM is always more
accretive at the EBITDA level. So this being there will show higher
EBITDA once the sales go up.

OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Mehul Sheth from Axis
Capital.

MEHUL SHETH, ASSISTANT VP OF PHARMACEUTICALS, AXIS CAPITAL LIMITED,
RESEARCH DIVISION: One question on your cost part. Right now your staff
cost, if you see, it's almost 50% up Y-o-Y, but on other expenses side
it's more of like a flattish number on a sequential basis as well. So
what is the -- can we consider this cost number to be -- this quarterly
run rate to be continued for next -- I mean, say, it will be a basic
quarterly run date now?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: So this is the choice, because I think even
in the last quarter, Amit made this point that the kind of competition
and the kind of competitive intensity that is being witnessed in the new
launches at present, and specifically in the case of Sitagliptin, which
happened a couple of months ago, we are not doing anything significantly
out of the ordinary in terms of promotion for the new products. Right
now we are there in the market. We are participating in the market, and
we are doing whatever it needs to be there, the bare basics.

The real competition and the real differentiation in the new products,
whether it is a SITA or anything else, it will happen 9 to 12 months
later when the dust settles down. So it is a very conscious call that we
decided to keep the other expenses at the same level on a linear basis.

So I think for the remainder of the year as well, going to the second
half of your question, we will broadly be in the overall numbers that we
have indicated. So we've indicated that, thanks to all the investments
happening this year, we'll be in the EBITDA margin range of 32% to 33%.
And we expect that, that is where we will end up at.

MEHUL SHETH: Also one question on your -- you have mentioned a product
on hold -- basically we...

OPERATOR: Sir, your voice is not very clear. If you're using earphones,
can you speak to the handset mode?

MEHUL SHETH: Now it's clear? Hello?

OPERATOR: Be a bit louder when you ask a question.

MEHUL SHETH: Just one question was on your MR productivity on
consolidated level. So you have mentioned about stand-alone. But what it
would be at consol level?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: Yes. So we don't necessarily track this at
consol level, so we can get back to you. But Amit just -- so the 2
biggest entities are Eris Lifesciences and Oaknet Healthcare. And Eris
is at INR 5.3 lakh, and Amit just mentioned that Oaknet is in the INR 3
lakh to INR 3.5 lakh zone. So we expect that by the end of the year,
Oaknet will get into a better zone in terms of run rate. So the average
at the consol level, it will be somewhere in between the 2 numbers.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The next question is from the line of
Sonal Gupta from L&T Mutual Fund.

SONAL GUPTA, HEAD OF RESEARCH & EQUITY, L&T INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
LIMITED: So just on this -- on Oaknet, I mean like we've -- like you
mentioned, you've done INR 100 crores of revenue in 4.5 months. So
should we expect that -- and even you're almost at INR 23 crores of
EBITDA and your EBITDA margin has gone to 24% this quarter. So I mean,
like -- but you're still guiding for INR 50 crores. So is there some
one-off in this quarter? Or should we expect that there is a good
likelihood that you'll exceed the numbers?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: I think we'll have to see how the next couple
of quarters play out. I think we anchored it in the INR 50 crore number,
because when we made the acquisition, we had given a guidance of INR 50
crores in FY '24. And so -- I mean, there is more than enough line of
sight to see that INR 50 crores will happen in FY '23 itself, so that's
the reason to pick that number.

But in terms of how the next 2 quarters will pan out, as Amit said,
we've been in the business only for 4 months or so. So I think we'll be
in a better position to answer this once we are through with quarter 3.

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: Correct.

SONAL GUPTA: And on the tax rate, is there some benefit of the Oaknet
acquisition which is depressing the tax rate this quarter? Could you
just highlight?

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: No, no, tax rate -- Oaknet EBITDA has been
around INR 16 crores, INR 17 crores this quarter. But overall, if you
see the tax impact, we have taken it as around 9% on an annual basis.

SONAL GUPTA: So tax rate is 1%, right, consol?

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: 9%. 1%?

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We see here, and the consol level
is just 1% of PBT.

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: Yes. So that's what I'm asking, is that even...

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Comes to 9%.

SONAL GUPTA: So I'm asking that this 1% on a full year basis this should
revert to 9%-10%, right?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: Yes, it is 9%. So if you take H1, right,
you'll see the number to be around 9%. So there were some higher tax
provisions in the quarter 1, which we have reversed. Overall, if you see
H1, it will be 8% to 9%, and that's where it will remain.

SONAL GUPTA: And just in terms of like -- when you'd originally guided
for 30% growth for this year, you were expecting around 15% growth on an
organic basis. So I mean, given what's transpired in the first half, how
do you see that target?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: So I think it depends on how Q3 pans out,
because we've only seen 1 quarter of revival, 4 months to be precise in
the cardio-metabolic market, and that is what has led to a slight uptick
in our expectation as well, which we've outlined in our investor
presentation.

So our expectation, as I highlighted in the earlier part of this call
also, that we'll get 2 effects flowing in, in the second half. One is
the benefit of the price increases will become visible. And second is
the benefits of the new product launches will also become visible as the
products scale up today.

So yes, absolutely, it is expected that there will be some improved
traction in the second half subject to the market continuing to support.

SONAL GUPTA: And just a clarification on this price increase impact
also, right? Like, I mean, if you've taken the price increases from
April or even from June, the primary sales that we've done this quarter
should reflect that benefit, right?

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: It doesn't works out like that. It works out
from the last year-to-date. So if the last price hike was taken, say, on
a product last September, then you have to take it this September. So
that's how it works out. It doesn't follows the calendar year or a
financial year. It follows a 12-month period from the last increment
which you took. So that is why you see this lag.

SONAL GUPTA: Yes, and that I understand. So your price hikes are more
weighted towards the second half of the year, is it?

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: Correct. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The next question is from the line of
Yash Tanna from ithought PMS.

YASH TANNA;ITHOUGHT PMS;ANALYST: So my question was around
Dydrogesterone that you've launched this quarter. So I think there are 2
or 3 big players who already have a decent market share in this
molecule. And maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but there are 2 or
3 players who already have a very decent market share. And there are a
few new players also who have entered this market. So on this particular
molecule how do we see growth, and how big is the market? If you can
highlight on that part?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: So I'll just answer the market part, and then
I'll invite Amit to share his insights as well. So the Dydro market is
INR 750 crores per annum now, and it is growing -- still continues to
grow at 45%-50% per annum, which is a phenomenal market to be in.
Because that's been our thesis all along that let us participate in
high-growth markets and let us try and take a disproportionate share of
the incremental market that gets created.

So INR 750 crore market growing at 40%-50% per annum means that, what,
you have like a INR 300 crores -- INR 250 crores, INR 300 crores market
getting created every year. So that's like a new playing field for us.

In terms of what we are seeing on the ground on competitive intensity,
et cetera, I would invite Amit to share his comments.

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: Yes. So there is a little bit disadvantages we
have because the prices have crashed. Not -- crash it's not the right
word, the prices have come down in the last 3 months. And we are having
an inventory, which will last us for at least 4 more months. So that is
a small disadvantage of we not being able to participate in this price
going down, at least for the next 4 months. It's after, I think,
December, January, we will be able to do the price again. So I think we
will be missing our target. We were thinking about INR 30 crores by the
end of the year, which I think now stands at around 25%-26% in that
range.

But at the prescription level, we are doing fine. And Dydrogesterone is
something which we won't miss in the gynecology therapeutics. So that's
where we stand at this point of time.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Kunal Dhamesha from Macquarie.

KUNAL DHAMESHA: Just on the insulin franchise, so we have been in the
market for now, I think, more than 6 months, right? So what has been the
initial thought process? You kind of command 5% plus prescription share
in the overall anti-diabetic market, but is it basically going to
translate us for insulin franchise events? Any thoughts on that would be
useful.

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: Yes, Kunal. Good question, actually. We believe
that we'll end up this year at around INR 18 crores. That's what we
think we'll do INR 18 crores, INR 20 crores this year. And this has all
started from scratch. So there's no other product which is there in the
basket.

We feel that INR 18 crores to INR 20 crores is a good number for the
first year. It's all organic growth. It also applies the thesis again
that we think we will be profitable next year. Therefore, a good thing
is you can still build a good business and make it profitable in 1
years' time.

We are good with the insulin business as such, as I told you in the last
call. Now, strategically, you have to wait it out for 6 months, 9
months, so that the product becomes available. Availability in insulin
is very, very important, and units of product which is not available
across because of the kind of requirement it has from the storage point
of view.

But we are -- I'm quite happy about this. And you will see a lot of
traction building up in this business as with the launch of Glargine,
which is very contemporary. We are launching it just post Diwali. So
that means starting in November. So that will get us to the second phase
of growth in insulin. And so far, we have done well.

We will be a considerably good player in the insulin market. The quality
has been appreciated. We've been around for some time now. We have
thousands of patients on our insulins now. More than 23,000 patients are
taking our insulin. So we are working on it. I think we are on the right
track.

KUNAL DHAMESHA: Sir, just a follow-up on that. If I look at our revenue
and EBITDA on the insulin franchise, let's say, roughly on a quarterly
basis, so like making roughly INR 8 crore kind of EBITDA loss, right?
And -- but let's say, when you launch Glargine, do you see that there is
an incremental launch costs, et cetera, coming in for Glargine?

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: Yes, yes, there will be incremental cost and
there will be an incremental revenue also. So it's not that we will be
in this year coming into a positive zone at any point of time. So we
have considered both these things. We have already burnt-out almost INR
10 crores.

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: 10...

AMIT INDUBHUSHAN BAKSHI: Yes. We might burn out around INR 8 more crores
in this year, roughly, and reach an INR 18 crores to INR 20 crores of
total sales. And we are quite sure that from next year, we are not
burning any more.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We have a question from the line of
Mahesh Vyas from UTI Mutual Fund.

MAHESH VYAS;UTI MUTUAL FUND;ANALYST: Sir, just one question. What is the
payback period we are expecting for this Oaknet acquisition?

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: Yes. Mahesh, we don't look at simple payback.
We look at IRR on our investment when we go into it. So any investment
that has a more than 30% IRR, we consider it as a good investment in our
system. So I think with the Oaknet acquisition ramping up better than
expected. I think all I can say is that the IRR of the deal will be far
better than what we had expected going in.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) As there are no further questions, I
would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. V. Krishnakumar for
closing comments.

KRISHNAKUMAR VAIDYANATHAN: Thank you all for your participation on the
call. By way of summary, the Oaknet business acquired in May 22 is
emerging as a success story for us in value creation through M&A.

Through the deployment of various execution and growth levers, we see
this business delivering an EBITDA of INR 50 crores this financial year,
which is 1 full year ahead of expectation when we went into the deal.

As per AWACS, Eris has grown at 19.3% in quarter 2 versus the market
growth of 13%. For the first half of this year, Eris has grown at 13.6%
versus the market growth of 7.4%. We have entered an era where we have
clear visibility on secular growth in our Cardio-Metabolic segment and
our 3 emerging therapies over the next 3 years. We will continue
pursuing growth opportunities in these segments through multiple levers,
including new products, expansion of doctor coverage and inorganic
expansion.

Eris delivered a Q2 consolidated revenue of INR 461 crores with an
EBITDA of INR 151 crores and a PAT of INR 119 crores. For the first half
of this year, Eris delivered a consolidated revenue of INR 859 crores,
EBITDA of INR 281 crores and profit after tax of INR 212 crores.

For this financial year '23, we are targeting a consol revenue growth of
30% and a consol EBITDA growth of 16% to 17%, including Oaknet.

Thank you. I wish all of you and your loved ones are safe and Happy
Diwali.

conference. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your

Internet of Things: Exploring the Applications of IoT

Electronics For You

The Internet of Things has become a game changer in today's world and is
playing a vital role in the industrial revolution. This article explores
the uses of IoT in healthcare systems, water supply, recycling systems
and many other areas

Vinayak Ramachandra Adkoli, is BE in industrial production. He has been
a lecturer in mechanical department for ten years in three different
polytechnics. He is also a freelance writer and cartoonist

The Internet of Things (IoT) could be a game changer for India, but the
country is lagging far behind China in its adoption. Today, the IoT is
transforming industrial revolution. An IIoT factory can yield 5-12.5%
cost reduction in operation and optimisation, 10-40% cost savings in
predictive maintenance and 20-50% cost reduction in inventory
optimisation.

To boost IoT concepts, Indian technology giant Wipro announced the
launch of industrial IoT Center Of Excellence (COE) in Kochi, Kerala on
March 14, 2019. According to Wipro, this COE aims at developing
innovative solutions for customers in industrial manufacturing,
automotive, healthcare and pharmacy. COE aims at developing
customer-ready IoT solutions.

Innovations needed for IoT industries

Innovation leads, the world follows. With the rise in the Indian Startup
Ecosystem, innovation has reached its peak in the country with 45,444
patent applications filled in 2016-17 alone.

Today, a lot of IoT related startups are coming and working in India.
They are deliberately taking advantage of the Internet to enhance the
abilities of the devices. The devices may be lighting system, entry into
home, water sprinklers used for irrigation in agriculture, traffic
control system, vehicles, road lighting systems and many more. In a
smart city, electric transmission, billing and the security of various
services such as banks, ATMs, hotels, etc, are all done through
IoT-operated devices. Dealing with IoT related projects by companies and
startups is offering great challenges.

Vyuti is a visual object intelligence provider for the manipulation of
objects by robotic arms. It can pick, orient and place objects in
various locations. With adequate training, the solutions can be applied
in sectors like manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and
warehousing. Today, there are many solutions in the market for object
recognition. Funded by N.A. Gokul, Vyuti is in talks with TVS, AMS and
Sansera.

Numocity is working with the electric vehicle ecosystem. It aims in
connecting battery, charging stations, etc, via a transaction engine,
distributed ledger and an artificial intelligence (AI) based engine.
Founded by Ravikiran Annasamy, Numocity was a member of Bosch's DNA 2.0
Cohort in 2018.

Areas benefitting through IoT

While India is considered to be the fourth largest home for startups,
the failure rates are also very high here due to many factors including
difficulties in managing the ventures.

The hundred billion dollars Indian healthcare industry is set for
revolution. Big data, IoT and AI will shape the future of this new
ecosystem.

Increased entry of affordable IoT devices and rising consumer
expectations are driving the rapid growth of the IoT market. The IoT
market in India is expected to reach 15 billion dollars by 2020,
accounting for nearly five per cent of the total global market. With
nearly 120 firms offering solutions in the IoT segment today, there are
tremendous opportunities for further growth.

Smart lifestyles, embedded homes, buildings, healthcare and
manufacturing are key sectors in India for IoT startups. Investors are
now showing more interest in IoT startups with a cumulative investment
of more than sixty million dollars since 2014. The top four areas of
funding are: lifestyle/wearables, embedded computing, industrial
Internet and connected homes.

Today, various operations of the city such as traffic, electricity,
water, waste management, and much more are done on IoT platforms.
Samsung R&D Institute in Bengaluru, Nasscom, Intel and L&T together have
announced the formation of Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) India
Ecosystem Task Force to increase awareness about global IoT standards
and their benefits for the Indian IoT industry.

IoT based systems for water supply and water recycling

Increasing dependence on ground water as a reliable source of water in
rural areas of India has resulted in unlimited extraction of water.
Without considering the research of aquifers as well as other
environmental factors, ground water source may be threatened. IoT based
systems can even help to utilise waste water at malls, flats, etc. Not
less than 380,000 litres of water is recycled at Orion mall, Bengaluru
every day based on an IoT based system.

Greenvironment India is an environmental engineering company incubated
at IIT Chennai, offering smart water and waste water management
solutions for residential companies/ apartments, commercial
establishments, institutions and industries.

IoT based smart sensor solutions on the cloud can monitor pH, Flow, DO
(dissolved oxygen ), ORP (oxidation reduction potential), TDS (total
dissolved salts), level, pressure, temperature of water during water
supply. It can keep automatic records of the above parameters and send
alerts over email or SMS.

Smart water management systems in multi-specialty hospitals are helping
to reduce hundred litres/person/ head resulting in 20-30 percent water
conservation. Today, in 172 apartments of Chennai, dependency on an
external supply of water is greatly reduced by producing good-quality
recycled water for 55 percent of the communities living here using an
efficient IoT based system. This has resulted in saving of thirty
percent of overall water costs.

Effects of IoT based wearables in the healthcare system

The market size for wearables had reached 25 billion dollars by the end
of 2019. Currently, wearable technologies are considered as an integral
part of IoT based projects and include smartwatches, fitness bands, and
even AR/VR headsets. The smart contact lens is one of the most
anticipated medical IoT technologies. Pharmaceutical giant Novartis
teamed up with Google to build this revolutionary device that promises
to help patients with diabetes by measuring their glucose levels as well
as assisting those with eye problems.

The smart contact lens looks like a regular contact lens, but it comes
with a sensor that can track the blood sugar level of the user
non-invasively through the tears and correct vision in a new innovative
way. The project was initially designed by Google X.

The lens contains a tiny and ultra-slim microchip that is embedded in
one of its thin concave sides. Through its equally tiny antenna, it will
send data about glucose measurements from the user's tears to his or her
paired smartphone via installed software. This technology has got the
potential to lower the cost of managing the chronic disease and
encourage people to get involved in managing their health digitally.

To sum up

IoT is an emerging field of Internet technology. It is a field of
research and innovation concerned with increasing the abilities of
devices on the Internet scale. Ordinary rules of operating devices no
longer apply here. Basically, here the Internet leaves its classical
realm and enters a new world of control of devices mechanism.

The scientific community, policy makers, apex bodies and funding
agencies are continuously striving to progress in various areas of IoT.
In the last two decades, India has achieved many milestones in the areas
of IoT and many are yet to be achieved.

Running a company a big stress test, say founders

Bengaluru: Entrepreneurs and investors in the startup ecosystem
expressed shock and offered condolences on the death of VG Siddhartha,
the founder of Cafe Coffee Day chain, while pointing out that the
pressures and hardships attached to entrepreneurship do not get
discussed widely.The incident has made founders who've been through a
tough phase running companies talk about their struggles, failures and
challenges. Real estate site Common-Floor's cofounder Sumit Jain
admitted being under pressure while running the sale process of his
first startup as it was acquired by Quikr. "Factors like failing to
deliver as per expectations, worrying about rejections, physical, mental
or emotional fatigue, and putting the startup's growth ahead of
everything in life results in the loss of friends, hurts personal
relationships and health," he said.

Jain now runs OpenTalk, a voice-based social platform that connects
people over their topics of interest.Entrepreneurs said the pressure is
immense on a daily basis. There are hardly any discussions about this in
the industry, which results in loneliness and depression, they say. "The
stress level magnifies as a CEO, especially because you're responsible
for cash flow. It can get very lonely," said Ravish Naresh, who first
cofounded Housing.com and now runs Khatabook, which helps small
businesses in recordkeeping and accounting. Naresh has brought on board
a therapist consultant in his new venture. "Anyone in the company can
approach this person. Sometimes these initiatives can be the difference
between life and death."Experts said most startups do not have processes
to tackle such issues, while bigger companies may be better equipped.
"There is intense pressure from investors - and from oneself - to
achieve great outcomes. This drives entrepreneurs to make every second
count, reducing the time spent on rest, relaxation and on relationships,
leading to fatigue, loneliness and isolation," said Shyam Bhat,
psychiatrist and head at Mindfit.Investors have a big role in mentoring
and easing the anxiety of founders, industry observers said. According
to Revent Bhate, partner at Kstart, a seed fund initiative by Kalaari
Capital, his single-biggest objective has been to engage transparently
with founders, give them a clear picture of their best options and meet
them in person. "Face-toface meetings... are a great way to build
rapport and pick up on nonverbal signals that are hard to catch over
calls," he said.But, Rahul Chowdhri, partner at Stellaris Venture
Partners, said the Indian startup ecosystem is slowly changing and has
started to embrace failures. "Startups and investors do not shy away
from working with failed entrepreneurs anymore and even when the
pressure is high, the rewards are also high." For Reprint Rights:

How the pandemic has impacted reading habits and festivals - insights
from authors at the Bangalore Business LitFest 2021

Speakers at the Bangalore Business Literature Festival explain how the
ongoing pandemic has impacted the way books are read, purchased, and
discussed.

The seventh annual Bangalore Business Literature Festival (BBLF) will be
held entirely online this year, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As
festival media partner, see YourStory's coverage of the editions in
2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015.

See also YourStory's Book Review section with reviews of over 320
titles, and our compilation of 85 Quotes on World Book Day.

BBLF 2021 will be held on September 21-23 next week. Our earlier preview
articles addressed startup advice, failure recovery and business
resilience. In this article, authors discuss changes in reading habits
due to the lockdowns, popular categories of reading, digital shifts, and
impacts on literature festivals.

1. Categories of reading

"The pandemic has changed much about how we used to conduct our lives.
Office culture, home routine, shopping habits, eating habits, daily
routines, and of course reading habits have all undergone a change in
the last 20-odd months," explains V Raghunathan, BBLF Chair and former
Professor, IIM Ahmedabad, in a chat with YourStory.

His bestsellers include Games Indians Play, Ganesha on the Dashboard;
The Corruption Conundrum; and Locks, Mahabharata and Mathematics. He
cites evidence that books on self-help, spirituality, entrepreneurship,
history, science, and technology figured significantly on people's
reading lists during the pandemic.

"Apparently, both fiction and non-fiction revenue grew steeply at
Amazon. In 2020, for instance, English non-fiction grew about 38 percent
and fiction about 21 percent," Raghunathan adds.

"Intuitively, this is only to be expected. With much of work commuting,
outing, socialising, and vacationing virtually at a standstill, people
do have more disposable time. Reading also sensibly competes with
television - after all, one can Netflix only so much," he jokes.

2. Multiple formats

"I think the overall trend has been towards shorter, more
action-oriented content. Also, there is an increased interest in
multiple formats," observes Jessie Paul, CEO of B2B consulting firm Paul
Writer and author of No-Money Marketing: From Upstart to Big Brand on a
Frugal Budget.

Her current book has more visuals and work-notes than her previous book.
"Audio is on the rise. I had to consciously look at ways to keep the
reader engaged by asking questions and providing DIY frameworks," she
adds.

Jesse has been writing a weekly newsletter for over 10 years. "The
pandemic saw a rise in engagement, as people were looking for
interesting and useful content and had time to respond," Jesse recalls.

She is looking to further embrace the new multimedia world and launch a
podcast which will share thoughts on marketing, business strategy, and
the latest trends.

3. Physical purchase and delivery

"The pandemic did generate lot of demand from people who wanted to read
books, but logistics was a concern as books were not classified as an
essential commodity during lockdowns," says Suresh Narasimha, tech
entrepreneur and Co-founder at CoCreate Ventures.

He is also the owner of JustBooks, a library chain and platform. Founded
in 2008, it has branches and home delivery services in a range of
cities, and can source books from elsewhere if not available locally.

During the pandemic, it added online storytelling sessions and
workshops. "Our highest growth during the pandemic was in the areas of
spirituality and wellness-related genes," Suresh explains.

4. Working and watching from home

"I think the pandemic has impacted people's reading habits in a positive
manner. With the advent of work from home and frequent lockdown, people
have started focusing on personal skill development, keeping aside time
for reading and reflection," explains Dr Karthik Nagendra, CEO of
ThoughtStarters.

He is also author of The Thought Leader Way: Leading Your Business with
Thought Leadership in an Altered World. "Research shows 35 percent
people have started reading more post pandemic. This is a positive trend
for authors like me," he adds.

5. Device shift

"Physical book buying has come down, and Kindle reading has gone up -
but not to the same extent," observes R Gopalakrishnan, author of over
15 books on management, including A Biography of Innovations and Wisdom
For Startups From Grown-ups.

"Book lovers and authors have been affected by the pandemic lockdowns. I
also find that publishers' appetite to review business books has
declined," he adds.

Gopalakrishnan cautions that the economy and eudaemonia ('good spirit')
may not revive without honest and sustainable enterprise. He hopes that
respect and resources for book enterprises will receive a boost via
festivals like BBLF.

6. Recovery

"Although book sales crashed during lockdown, the industry has almost
recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Authors now have many more modes to
find new readers - from Clubhouse rooms to Instagram live sessions,"
observes Vivan Marwaha, user researcher and author of What Millennials
Want: Decoding the Largest Generation in the World.

"The pandemic has in many ways led to an increase in readership. With
people spending less time commuting and at big social events, they have
more time to read," he adds.

7. Festival impacts

Online festivals are obviously very different from their physical
counterparts, in terms of experience, reach, access, and cost.

"I think the most important aspect of any litfest is the atmosphere -
the atmosphere of care-free abandon, mild chaos, hubbub of excited
chatter, informal interactions, meeting one's favourite authors,
opportunity to interact with publishers, and such," observes V
Raghunathan, BBLF Chair.

"Sadly, much of this has been taken away from the online fests. While
most litfests have transitioned to online formats, they have had to
contend with 'Zoom fatigue'," he cautions.

Litfests were also a more interesting way of getting away from it all
and being in closer proximity to the atmosphere of books. "That has
failed to happen with the online format, which is simply reduced to some
more Zoom, cramped at home with family and pets," he laments.

There are obvious benefits, of course in terms of lower costs. "One
doesn't have to pay for the flights of the speakers, for the venues, for
the facilities and security, and such," Raghunathan explains.

"Also, those who are strictly interested only in a particular quality of
interaction involving a certain panel, and nothing else besides, may
find the online format to their taste," he adds.

One way of dealing with online fatigue is to add interesting and unique
topics to a litfest, according to Benedict Paramanand, Co-founder of
BBLF and author of CK Prahalad - The Mind of the Futurist.

Examples of such features at BBLF 2021 include a panel on New Work, New
Workplace, a deep-dive session on the history of publishing, an in-depth
look at the rise of 'deep state' and government secrecy in India, and
panels on trends like reinventing marketing as well as business
journalists venturing into writing books.

"We also noticed the emergence of literature tech platforms. We got the
founders of Pratilipi and StoryMirror to come and discuss their
adventure. JustBooks too is reinventing itself as a library platform. It
will be interesting to hear them," Benedict adds.

Foreign authors have also been roped in, as was the case with the online
edition of BBLF last year as well. This year's lineup includes Mike
Shatzkin, Mauro Guillen, David Scott, and Indian-origin American author
Rishad Tobaccowalla.

Alpha JWC Startup Series: pitching & fundraising through the lens of a
VC

Startups in Southeast Asia raised a record $25.7 billion in funding[1]
in 2021 alone; this was more than double the previous year. While this
means that investors see great potential in businesses in the region,
this also means that the competition here is fierce and it is not easy
to stand out amidst the competitive landscape.

As such, in a bustling, highly competitive startup ecosystem like
Southeast Asia's, there is one golden question that haunts all founders
and entrepreneurs. What do VCs want?

To help answer this question, we spoke with Eko Kurniadi[2], Investment
Partner at Alpha JWC — one of the leading VCs in the region. With
offices in Indonesia and Singapore, Alpha JWC has a team that brings
together some of the region's pioneer tech investors and experienced
serial entrepreneurs.

With companies like Indonesian F&B unicorn Kopi Kenangan, Singapore's
largest AI-driven used car marketplace Carro, and fintech unicorn Ajaib
in their portfolio, Alpha JWC is constantly on the lookout for companies
and entrepreneurs that have the potential to rise and make a legacy
impact.

What do VCs in Southeast Asia want?

First things first, before delving deep into Alpha JWC's unique
expectations and experiences, we first try to understand what VCs and
investors look for in companies in Southeast Asia.

Eko shares that VCs, especially international investors, generally have
a prerequisite for various forms of validation and proof points before
they make the final decision to invest in a company.

Commonly, they look for the following:

Hockey stick growth patterns (hockey stick refers to sudden and
extremely rapid growth after a long period of linear growth. The term is
often used to describe what happens when a startup business finds its
market niche and market conditions are positive). This means startups
are experiencing a positive but unprecedented market reception spurred
by unique trends that are favourable to the kind of products or services
being offered by those companies. Market leadership, which can be
evidenced through a solid historical track record in comparison to other
similar players in the space, and with a significant preference from
users and customers who choose and stick with the product/service. The
presence of reputable investors in the cap table (A cap table, or
capitalisation table, is a chart typically used by startups to show
ownership stakes in the business). Through this, investors will be able
to pinpoint which startups are entrusted by other legitimate and
reputable investors who are likely to share their values.

Eko explains that these are important checkboxes. However the above
might not be apparent in the early days, especially in the early-stage
rounds. That is where the next segment comes into play too in
identifying early-stage startups to invest in.

Fundraising 101: Alpha JWC's guide

Elaborating on what factors are crucial for Alpha JWC when selecting
founders or businesses to invest in, Eko shared that the three most
important factors that they consider when looking to invest are
founders, market and product, and the 'X-factor'.

He explains that the founder should have a vision and should be able to
execute plans to achieve that goal while having the acumen to build the
right team. 'It is important for the founder to have clarity on what
they want to build in the long term and have the fortitude to see it to
fruition,' Alpha JWC prefers founders who are capable of executing their
plans, and demonstrate great leadership qualities — reflected in their
ability to build and hire world-class teams, and are inspiring and
uplifting.

Market & product is another important element, Eko explained. The
company should be targeting a sizable market, addressing the right pain
points with the right product-market fit. Here, an important factor
worth considering is looking at proven business models in a more mature
market. Startups can always learn from the more mature and advanced
markets like China or India, to try and understand what works and what
doesn't, while being cognizant of some differences in macroeconomic
situation and customer dynamics.

And, last but definitely not least, the 'X factor' is what matters a lot
to Alpha JWC — it makes visionaries stand out. The 'X factor' can be a
significant advantage the team has, and this is not limited to things
like a strategic backer — this ranges from the founder's unique
expertise to the team's industry experience and from solid historical
traction to various monetisation channels and proprietary networks to an
innovative business approach. The X factor is what ultimately sets them
apart.

Common missteps by founders: How not to turn off VCs

Indeed, 'what do VCs want' is an important question to ponder on, but
another question worth contemplating is 'what don't VCs want'. What are
some common missteps that founders make at the time of pitching to VCs?

Eko shared that one of the most common challenges is actually a very
fundamental one: not being able to articulate the big problem they want
to solve, their clear solution, and how it is unique or different from
other players in the field, as well as the vision or end-goal of the
company.

In fact, according to a CB Insights report[4], the number one reason why
startups fail was 'no market need.' Hence, having clarity on what
problem you want to solve should be key to startups seeking funds.

One great example of founders displaying clarity of thought and
succeeding is Ajaib: an Indonesian fintech startup that allows its users
to buy and sell stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds. The founders of this
online brokerage startup were very focused on serving the underbanked
and millennials in the country. And, with a clear objective at the core
of the company, the founders were able to deliver a trading platform
that is incredibly easy to use and onboard for retail investors. They
continued to optimise and reiterate their product offerings for the
increased benefit of users. As a result, today, they are one of the
leading fintechs in the country and among the fastest to reach unicorn
status in less than three years.

adoption easy and affordable[5]

Another misstep as shared by Eko is the gap between the founders'
expected valuation and the justified fundamentals of the company at that
juncture. For example, many founders don't understand that good early
traction might not necessarily warrant a significantly high valuation.
'Getting the highest possible valuation should not be the goal for
early-stage founders. The priority should be finding the right partner
who can help you achieve unicorn or even decacorn status,' says Eko.

Finally, lack of alignment and non-targeted discussions with too many
investors is another major misstep. 'Founders need to know the
investor's landscape, appetite, and value-adds that are relevant to
their business. Talking to too many people will only create a
distraction and potentially unnecessary noise in the market, Eko
explained.

The ultimate rundown of tips for pitching and fundraising in Southeast
Asia

Eko suggests that as long as startup founders focus on planning their
cash flow and runway, layout key milestones, and hit each of those to
show their execution capabilities, they will have a higher chance of
securing funding.

He shared that founders should ask for a reasonable investment amount
that can be justified. There is enough evidence to back this — one case
in point is the infamous Quibi failure.

https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflixAnd,
finally, it is crucial to LISTEN to investors' feedback and criticisms,
address those accordingly and come out stronger in the next meetings
with them and/or other investors. This is simply because an investor
brings in more strategic thinking where founders might sometimes be
bogged down with everyday operations. An investor's unique perspective
with a more commercial inclination and the added advantage of experience
from his many other investments is always something that founders can
leverage for better decision-making.

finance[6]

For acing the pitching game, Eko recommends that founders should kick
off with a concise explanation of their mission and solution. 'These
need to be delivered with clarity and conviction,' he shared. Founders
should have a powerful elevator pitch that will make an impression on a
busy audience that hears numerous pitches on a daily basis. 'To aid in
their storytelling, founders should prepare materials to visualise key
industry statistics, commercials, and future use of proceeds', he added.

In a nutshell, fundraising and pitching don't necessarily have to be
painful and tedious. With the right approach and clear goals in mind,
startup founders can thrive in a bustling ecosystem like Southeast Asia
and eventually grow beyond international boundaries.

The Game Changers

The past decade witnessed an eye-catching development of infrastructure,
especially in the power sector. Over this period, access to power of the
citizens increased from 46% to 92%. Works are in progress for bringing
the entire nation under the coverage of power supply by 2019. The
generation capacity increased to 17,340 MW, including 1,160 MW of
imports through cross border trading. The private sector contribution is
7,149MW.

The Power System Master Plan 2016 (PSMP 2016) suggests restricting
contribution of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to 50% of the 60,000
MW targeted for 2041. Besides, there is a plan for importing 10,000 MW
from regional countries within this period. On top of these, joint
ventures are being formed with foreign companies for setting up of
imported coal and LNG-based power plants under the public sector. Most
of these are being done under G-to-G initiatives. One of these is 1,320
MW Rampal Power Plant at Bagerhat of Bangladesh India Friendship Power
Company, a JV between Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and
NTPC, India). Another one is 1,320 MW Payera Power Plant by a JV between
NWPGCL, Bangladesh and CMC, China. The construction works of the first
phase of these projects are in progress. These two projects are financed
by EXIM Banks of India and China. Besides, different state-owned
enterprises are working on three large LNG-based and 11 coal-fired power
plants.

The joint venture initiative for attractive investment and developing
efficiency have been taken up recently, but power plant development
under the IPP concept came into being in late 1990s. The development
partners, including the World Bank (WB) and Asian Development Bank
(ADB), withdrew from providing loans for power plants in Bangladesh,
suggesting structural reforms for eliminating corruption and
mismanagement of the power sector. The financing for new power plants
was completely stopped in the 1996-2001 tenure of the government.

The demand started surpassing the supply and the deficit started
widening alarmingly. The situation became diabolic in the summer of
1996. Within a month of formation of the new government, the IPP policy
was formulated. Under its coverage initiative was launched for setting
up two large gas-based baseload power plants. US Company AES Corporation
has been selected as the developer, which started working on 360 MW
plant at Haripur and 450 MW at Meghnaghat. Haripur power plant came into
operation during the tenure of the then government. But Meghnaghat power
plant started operation during the early stage of the subsequent
government.

Questions were raised during the conclusion of Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA) as to whether the government would be able to pay for the purchase
of the power. At this stage the World Bank for one project and ADB for
the other provided partial risk guarantee on top of the government
guarantee of Bangladesh to the developer. The subsequent development is
known to all. Bangladesh has already established its image as a good pay
master. The confidence of the developers of the IPPs has strengthened
since then. Now one after another IPPs are being concluded with any
partial risk guarantee or sovereign guarantee. The PPA is considered
enough for signing contracts and proceeding with the works.

The power supply deficit had created serious adverse impacts on the
industrial development as well as operation of existing industries. The
government launched additional initiatives for confronting the
situation. There was no issue with fuel supply as there was adequate gas
availability at that time. The government for encouraging industries for
setting up captive power generation plants adopted captive power policy,
providing tax relief and other fiscal incentives.

According to Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), the country
now has 2,800 MW of captive power generation capacity. However, the
present gas deficit has created impediments to captive power generation.
Consequently, no new permission is being given for such plants now.
Petrobangla stated that 17% of their total gas supply last year was
given to captive power. Though a policy was developed for supplying
surplus power of one industry to the other or to the national grid, it
is not yet working.

29,714

Net Generation (REB) 1,929 1,882

Total Net Generation including REB (Public and Private) 57,276 62,678

Another innovative approach of the government in 19962001 was to
encourage local private sector for investing in power generation. For
this keeping in view of IPPs, another policy named Small Independent
Power Producer (SIPP) was developed. Under SIPP, tender was invited for
10 small power plants for Polly Bidyut Samity (PBS) of Bangladesh Rural
Electrification Board (BREB).

A local company participated, but ultimately could not become
successful. Later, local company Summit Group, a partner of
Summit-United JV of Khulna Barge Mounted power plant implemented three
power plants each having 11 MW of capacity for the PBSs. Starting with
this small step, Summit Group developed into the largest Bangladesh
Origin private sector power company in 18 years.

The expansion of power sector gathered momentum in 1980s. One military
regime succeeded another at that time. Corruption and mismanagement in
power sector developed into a culture. Inefficient generation system was
coupled with massive system loss of 47% in the distribution system
during that period. The BPDB became hostage to corrupt syndicate of
hostile trade unions and commission agents. The government’s
contribution to generation, transmission and distribution segments at
that time was bare minimum.

The power sector was almost exclusively depended on donor financing.
Towards the end of 1980s, some works of course started under the Russian
suppliers’ credit. During this time, all donor agencies coming together
started pressing for restructuring and reforms of the power sector as
conditions for loans. They suggested unbundling the BPDB into
generation, transmission and distribution companies. Dilly dally
strategy of the then government led to donors completely washing out
their hands from Bangladesh power sector.

At this stage, following the fall of military regime of General Ershad,
another political party BNP was formed in the womb of another military
ruler came to the state power. They also were reluctant to do the
reforms.

As such, the donors’ isolation from the Bangladesh power sector
continued. Consequently, apart from two plants constructed under Russian
and Chinese assistance, the BNP government failed to construct any power
generation plant. They also failed to develop any private sector power
generation policy suggested by the donors. Analysis of BPDB information
evidences that the power demand increased by 600 MW during the period of
1991-96. But the BNP government failed to increase the generation
accordingly.

The Awami League government after winning the election and forming the
government in 1996 finalized the IPP policy, by acknowledging the
donors’ suggestion. In 2001 once again the BNP-led alliance government
returned to the state power. The immediate past government during the
later stage of their term approved about 1415 projects under IPP,
suppliers’ credit and own financing. The BNP-Jamaat government cancelled
all these and tried for new ones.

But politics prevailed over the national priority of power generation.
During their entire term, they failed to take up and implement any new
project. The situation at the early stage was under control as most of
left over works of the earlier government were completed and power
supply commenced. But failure in taking up new power projects started
creating deficit from 2004 and loadshedding started getting massive.
Incidents of protesters getting killed by police firing upon
demonstrators demanding power supply happened.

Chaotic situation was created all over the country due to power supply
crisis. Some 8-12 hours every day, people had to bear the load shedding
at that time. During this period, public-private partnership policy was
adopted for selecting developers for power generation. Initiative was
taken for setting up of a 450 MW gas-based power plant at Sirajganj
under BPDB- Summit Group JV. But the contract signing for the project
was stuck at the highest level of approval.

There were allegations that for unholy activities and interception by
“Hawa Bhavan”, implementation of power generation projects was impeded.
One state minister was removed from such conflict at the last stage of
the term. At the very last stage, initiative was taken for setting up
some small plants 50-100 MW within six months. Investors were selected
on purely political consideration and some contracts were signed. But
implementation did not start.

In 2007, a long-serving interim government took charge. During the term,
contracts could be signed with some of the already selected and some new
investors for setting up contingency power plants. Power crisis grew
ominous. Construction of oil-based contingency plants started as a
desperate option. A few of these plants came into operation during the
tenure of the interim government and the rest when the new government in
2009 took over the office. But these hardly could cater to the huge
deficit that crippled the national economy and made life and living
almost unbearable.

The government, as a strategy to arrest the deficit growing further,
suspended all new power connections for a certain period. The gas
deficit also led to suspending gas connections to industries, captive
power and domestic consumers. Now the national committee on special
consideration is giving connections to industries after lifting the
embargo. During this period, the government moving away from the master
plan went for short, medium and long-term power generation initiative
for confronting the prevailing and emerging power crisis. The installed
generation capacity at that time was 5,200 MW, but actual generation was
3,800 MW. Now for all the initiatives the government has taken resulted
in reaching an installed capacity of 17,340 MW and highest generation of
around 12,000 MW.

But for the gas crisis, the contribution of liquid fuel to power
generation significantly increased. The contribution of liquid fuel is
now over 40%. For facilitating the contingency power generation, the
Emergency Power Generation And Energy Supply Act was adopted. That act
is still in existence. Under this act, the investors are selected for
short, medium and long-term power generation through negotiation by
passing the usual tendering process.

Now most of the investors working under the IPP are local companies.
Local companies under the IPP have already constructed 50 plants and
these are in operation. Summit Group tops the list, followed by United
Group. Others are Orion Group, Bangla Track Power, Energypac, Confidence
Power, Desh Power, Max Power, Doreen and few others. Dr Shamsul Alam,
Dean of Engineering of Daffodil University while talking to the EP said
that quality investment did not come for not selecting the developers
through competition. Corruption increased due to selecting the
developers through negotiation. Political influence also impacted.

The generation cost of power increased for all these. Consumers are the
ultimate victim as they have to account for higher tariff. Director
Generation of Power Cell Engr. Mohammad Hossain disagreed, stating that
though the developers are selected through negotiation, yet contract is
signed on the basis of reasonable generation cost. The generation cost
actually increased for unavoidable situation of gas crisis. The
increased use of expensive liquid fuel mostly contributed to the higher
generation cost.

BPDB information states of 57,276 million kwh power generation in
2016-17. The public sector contributed 26,597 million kwh while import,
IPP, SIPP and rental plants contributed 28,750 million kwh. The BREB’s
net generation was 1,929 million kwh. In 2017-18, the generation of
public sector was more than the private sector. The total generation was
62,278 million kwh. The public sector generated 31,082 million kwh and
contribution of the IPP, SIPP, rental and import was 29,714 million kwh.
REB generated 1,882 million kwh.

The draft PSMP 2016 targets achieving 60,000 MW of power generation
capacity by 2041. The government plans for restricting private sector
generation to 30,000 MW. The rest would come from public sector. The
government considers power from joint venture initiatives as public
sector contribution. According to the government, the JV initiatives may
contribute up to 20,000 MW. The foreign companies would have 50%
contributions. BUET Professor Dr M Tamim said the JVs like IPP is
another instrument for foreign investment and efficient management. But
the JVs must be concluded under a specific policy.

That is still not visible yet. On the other hand, the essence of IPPs
was drawing foreign direct investment. But the local companies’ lead in
IPP turned it upside down. Apart from Summit, all other local IPPs have
stressed upon foreign currency reserves. This is uncomforting for
Bangladesh. Dr Tamim observed that the fair and win-win contract even
100% dependency on private sector for power generation would not harm
the country’s interest.

In conclusion, the government is relieved of exclusive investment burden
in power generation for the advent of local and foreign private
companies. On the other hand local due to the companies being grown into
efficient developers and operators of the power plants. But it must be
seen on how the stress is being created on foreign currency reserves for
failure of the local companies due to foreign partners. But it should be
acknowledged that the efficiency in power sector has significantly
increased for involvement of the private sector.

The government is also investing for enhancing the efficiency. Whether
it is private sector or public sector involvement in power generation,
everything must be streamlined under a comprehensive planning. The
present success in power sector has come for significant contribution to
the private sector. The role of private sector cannot be undermined or
denied.

Today's 'impossible' is tomorrow's 'easy' - 8 design tips from SAP
Startup Social 2018

Vision, frugality, persistence, and focus on local context are key
design principles for startups, as explained by a range of speakers at
this annual forum.

Designers, developers and startup founders gathered in Bengaluru
recently for SAP's annual Startup Social conference and exhibition,
along with a range of investors, corporate executives and policymakers.

The event featured a keynote on design, along with a parallel track
organised by SAP Design Talks (see our earlier coverage here). Other
upcoming events on design in Bengaluru include Design4India, DesignUp,
UX India, and YourStory's own TechSparks 2018.

Here are eight key takeaways for designers, from the wide-ranging
sessions and workshops at this annual conference.

1. Yesterday's impossible is today's easy

Mobile interfaces, service design, and entertainment have come a long
way from the SMS-era to today's smartphones, thanks to rapid innovations
in digital interfaces, social media, and network bandwidth.

Peter Vesterback, former CEO of Rovio (Angry Birds), regaled the
audience with incidents from his business career in the mobile industry
when he was told some things were "impossible" or "unnecessary," but
they became easy later and a reality today. These include the rise of
the mobile phone in the US ("payphones are everywhere"), the ringtone
economy in Austria ("it may work in Finland but never in Austria"), and
the spectacular rise of Angry Birds ("100 million downloads is
impossible").

Entrepreneurs and designers therefore need to work not just on today's
platforms but on emerging tools like AR and VR that will become more
commonplace tomorrow. As tools and platforms evolve and converge,
designers need to be prepared for lifelong learning, up-skilling and
cross-skilling.

For example, Urban Ladder is expanding its VR capabilities to develop
online stores of unlimited size. AI, ML, blockchain and IoT are other
technologies with large potential in the emerging world of voice, video
and vernacular in India.

2. Success needs persistence, not just talent

Angry Birds, one of the most successful mobile games of all time, was
not an overnight success. The company Rovio began working on mobile
multi-player games in 2003, and only six years later, after 51 games, it
found success with Angry Birds on December 11, 2009.

User expectations for good design and fast interactions are rising
across sectors, and designers must persist in their attempts to meet
such cross-industry standards, according to Narendra Ghate, Head of
Research in UX and Service Design at Tata Elxsi.

3. Design for product-market fit

One of the most common causes of startup failure is lack of
product-market fit, explained Rajib Ghosh, Principal Design Manager,
Microsoft India. Other causes are inability to pivot, poor user
experience, and lack of user friendliness.

Good product-market fit leads to quick sales, customer testimonials, and
press coverage. While early adopters may put up with basic design, the
majority of the market wants more usable and impactful products. A
human-centred approach to design, powered by empathy, can build strong
connects with customers, advised Rajib.

Designers should carefully distinguish between what customers desire,
think, communicate, and do. As examples of effective design, Rajib cited
Arogya Finance and Big Bazaar; the Product-Market Fit Canvas was also
identified as a good tool for designers. "Uncover the root cause. Focus
on value proposition and not just features. Test relentlessly and keep
iterating," he advised aspiring designers.

"Relationships are the new product offering," said Narendra of Tata
Elxsi. In a world of proliferating and even bewildering choice, design
must help users feel they are in control.

"Human-centric innovation is about unmet and unarticulated needs of
customers and end users," he explained. The role of the future UX
designer is to manage runaway expectations, teach users empathy towards
technology, and recreate the sense of wonder for technology, Narendra
advised.

4. Design is in the brand name as well

Design does not stop with the product or service, but extends all the
way to the company's name and brand. "Angry Birds" is a great name for
the game because it makes you wonder why the birds are angry, joked
Peter Verstbacka.

In its early days, PayU increased visibility for its brand by flashing
its logo between screen downloads, said Jitendra Gupta, MD, PayU. Each
of Urban Ladder's furniture designs has a product story along with the
name, explained Rajiv Srivatsa, Co-founder, Urban Ladder.

5. Ask questions about data, don't just solve problems

Startups and designers should not just be building products for
customers, but asking deeper and broader questions about customer tasks,
pain points and aspirations. In a world of data deluge, data is not just
like oil but like water, according to a panel with speakers from SAP,
Asian Paints, Myntra, Tata Technologies, and Freight Tiger.

Data needs to be clear and usable, and a good data strategy can improve
productivity or design and also help come up with new business models.
Can you design a tyre that speaks? Can you collect data from IoT-enabled
smart tyres and offer a new business model of tyre as a mobility service
rather than tyre as a commodity?

Intuition and empathy may help with design and business models in early
stages, but insights from accurate data are important in scale stage,
according to the panellists.

6. Design for the local context

While some principles of design may cut across cultures, there are local
variations that also need to be factored in, advised Urban Ladder's
Rajiv Srivatsa. The furniture rental firm focuses on design elements
such as simplicity, professionalism, and novelty.

Indian audiences need more elements related to trust, aspiration,
authenticity, and longevity of products, he added. In terms of service
design, Indian customers expect the provider to assemble the furniture
and clear away the packaging. Consumers on slow mobile connections
expect faster downloads of product images; they also want furniture that
has a blend of modernity and traditional Indian aesthetics, said Rajiv.

He cited Paper Boat's drinks as a good example of modern packaging
drawing on Indian nostalgia. Other trends emerging in India are online
browsing coupled with offline buying, which calls for a tight
integration of user experience across channels - right down to
knowledgeable staff in retail chains.

"Build a brand that the customer can trust and you will be successful,"
said PC Mustafa, CEO and Co-founder, IDFresh Food, showing how his
company's dosa and idli batters have been developed at the intersection
of innovation, ethics, customers, distribution and technology.

Social entrepreneurs also need to focus on the rural context of their
proposed innovations, advised Lakshman PS, Innovation and Design
Strategist at SAP Labs India. For example, the water drawing ritual at
village wells also serves as an occasion for community communication,
which can yield new insights for innovation and services around drinking
water.

As examples of effective local design, Lakshman cited Google Maps
India's evolution from pure distance-based to landmark-based navigation,
as well as Jaldoot e-Health Point, which provides families in rural
villages with clean drinking water, medicines, and tele-medical
services.

7. Be frugal

Elements of frugality need to be factored into all aspects of a startup
organisation, right from product and process to marketing collaterals
and brand name. "We use our own employees as models in our product
videos," joked Urban Ladder's Rajiv Srivatsa.

Binny Bansal, Co-founder of Flipkart, explained how they spent two to
three nights choosing the name of their company - it had to be cool,
eight characters long, different from other names, and the cheapest
available domain name. Frugality, fast iteration, and the right team are
essential success factors for a startup, he advised (see full article
here).

8. Think ecosystem, not just centre of excellence

It is important for cities and regions to build inter-connected
communities of designers. This includes companies, universities,
startups and civil society, for broad-based awareness and appreciation
of design.

It is popular for companies to set up centres of competency or
excellence, but a better approach may be to set up on open platform like
a bazaar, suggested Peter Vesterbacka. He had earlier set up the HP
Bazaar as a branded community for startups to engage with HP. Helsinki
was also the launchpad for the global meetup movement for mobile
startups, called MobileMonday.

Regional ecosystems take decades to build, said Peter; Silicon Valley's
foundations were laid way back in the 1930s. Industrial and sectoral
ecosystems also take long to build or transform; the education sector in
countries like India can adapt to elements of the Finnish system, which
is the focus on Peter's next startup.

All the schools in Finland are excellent; the best school is the nearest
school, he joked. "Learning how to learn is one of the most important
skills across disciplines," he said.

The road ahead

The speakers at the conference generally agreed that the startup and
design ecosystem in India is slowly maturing, with a call for more
community networking and engagement with the broader ecosystem. Better
industry-academia partnerships are needed; Germany is exemplary in such
collaboration, according to Margit Hellwig-Botte, Consul General at the
German Consulate in Bengaluru.

Wrapping up the panel on 'Vibrant Ecosystems,' Ravi Gururaj, President
of TiE Bangalore, said the components of ideas, talent, investment, and
government support are coming together in a favourable manner. "This is
a fantastic time to be an entrepreneur in India," he said. The panel
also focused on the challenges of sustainability and urban planning at
scale, with the backdrop of Bengaluru's notorious traffic jams and
pollution as a backdrop.

In sum, you can succeed in the innovation journey if you can walk on
water, joked Peter Vesterbacka; after all, in Finland's winters, all the
lakes are frozen and you can indeed walk on water!

STARTCON 2018: PH startups get a crack at $1-million pitch in Oz confab

The Manila Times

A million Australian dollars, or approximately P39 million, may be the
boost that struggling Philippine startups need - to develop their core
business, widen their market reach and launch their company into the
global arena.

While many can only dream of attracting a top-notch investor from
Silicon Valley, their chances of attaining that elusive success may be
found closer to home. StartCon, the largest startup and growth
conference Down Under, has been searching for the most promising
startups in 15 cities across the Asia-Pacific since May.

The regional finals of the conference competition are currently being
held in Singapore; Jakarta, Indonesia; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai,
China; and Chennai, India.

The Philippine regional contest, known as "Pitch $1 Million in Manila,"
will be held on October 26 at Penbrothers Sheridan.

The 600 semi-finalists who will emerge as winners in these events will
proceed to the main event on November 30 to December 1 in Sydney,
Australia, which is projecting an estimated 4,000 attendees. All
semi-finalists will be given a chance to pitch the worthiness of their
startup, its core business and its future to renowned investors and
industry leaders. The ultimate victor, who will be recognized as
Asia-Pacific's Best Startup, will receive AU$1 million in funding from
Right Click Capital, an investment firm that specializes in identifying,
investing in and supporting technology businesses across Australia, New
Zealand and Southeast Asia.

That prize money may be the game-changer that can push the startup to
the next phase it is aiming for, such as massive product expansion. It
can also be the lifeline that just might stop the fledging bootstrapping
firm from closing shop. As StartCon CEO Cheryl Mack points out, industry
standard pegs the attrition or failure rate of new startups at 90
percent. Only one out of 10 succeed - and these are the ones that
usually present a significant and marketable solution to long-standing
unaddressed needs such as unremitting traffic, inexpensive in-demand
video streaming services and affordable travel accommodations.

Mack enumerates the qualities that venture capitalists, financiers and
other moneyed investors look for in startups and founders as they look
at their term sheets. She says: "A sound business model is one of the
core things a potential investor will look at. If the startup relies
heavily on technology for its business, then it's important that the
technology can be protected. Sometimes a unique offering will set a
startup apart from the rest, but other times a startup that simply does
something better than the rest can be equally as compelling. But no
matter what, the top thing a startup needs is a good leadership team to
tie everything together and execute well."

Perhaps that's why a fulltime founder who is giving his or her total
attention and effort to the startup gets a second look. That leader and
his management team must be able to represent and clearly show the
company's mission. Progress is also another plus point. The product or
service that the founder is pitching is no longer an idea that needs
money to be realized; instead, regardless of the speed or ease of its
development, it is functioning and gaining traction. Startup founders
wanting to pitch in Manila and/or Austraslia must have a ready pitch
deck, which shows the accomplishments of the company, to date.

All kinds of startups have been showing up at StartCon since its own
launch nine years ago. Some have been turning in steady profits while
others still have to show return on investment although they have raised
millions of dollars in financing. StartCon can open more doors for them
by introducing them to venture capitalists and angel investors. Mack
clarifies that while the event organizer itself is neither of the two,
its "aim is to support startups in the region and help to find new
talent and work to support them in their efforts to go global. The
competition is open to all technology startups in any industry or
sector."

She is particularly excited about the startup ecosystems in Asia, which
she describes as "a hotbed of innovation, with places like Singapore,
Seoul, Jakarta and Manila among others acting as a breeding ground for
new startups, especially in the digital space."

Finally, Mack has this piece of advice to the Filipino startup founders
who will win the regional conference in Manila and will be flying to
Sydney by November: "Because you only have a short amount of time to
make your pitch, you should be able to convey the following things: the
problem being addressed, the solution provided by the business,
opportunity size, the business model, the competition, the marketing and
go-market strategy, the leadership team, and the traction achieved so
far."

Too Soon for 'All Clear' in D&O Insurance Market as Banks Fall

Indian Insurance News

March 21, 2023

[]

Length: 3438 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

March 21 -- D&O insurers breathed a short sigh of relief when the U.S.
government pledged to protect depositors of failed Silicon Valley Bank
last week.

But it wasn't necessarily business as usual for watchful underwriters in
the days following the March 12 announcement-whether they were focused
on providing directors and officer insurance and other management
liability coverages for financial institutions or for tech startups.

 

"I agree that the move by the Treasury, and the Fed, and the FDIC on
Sunday night [March 12] made a huge difference. Had they not done that,
we would've had a very different scenario on Monday. We could well have
seen companies fail, employees being terminated, all kinds of bad
stuff," said Kevin LaCroix, an attorney and executive vice president of
RT ProExec, a management-liability-focused division of wholesaler RT
Specialty.

"That immediate trauma was averted," LaCroix told Carrier Management
last Friday, a week after the bank was seized by U.S. regulators. "But
it's way too early to give the all-clear," he said during a phone
interview just four days after the first shareholder class action was
filed against SVB and two of its executives.

 

Earlier in the week, AM Best published a report stating that
"underwriters of directors and officers insurance for startups and
venture capitalists, as well as the financial institution insureds
supporting such entities, could have faced financial distress given that
they are operating on very thin capital" if the U.S. government had not
stepped in to make all of SVB's depositors whole. "The potential for D&O
claims for startups would have been high in the case government had
decided not to help the depositors," stated David Blades, AM Best
associate director, industry research and analytics.

"Just the subsequent events this week show that there's still a lot of
turmoil in the marketplace," LaCroix said, pointing to the fact that
European banking giant Credit Suisse needed a lifeline from the Swiss
Central bank to stay afloat. "Credit Suisse had nothing to do with what
went wrong at SVB or Signature," a second bank that collapsed recently.
"It had a whole different set of issues. But because it was a troubled
bank, investors turned. And had the Swiss Bank not stepped in and
extended the short-term lending line, Credit Suisse might have tumbled,
too," said LaCroix, also known to insurers as the author of the D&O
Diary blog. (On Sunday, UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for more than $3
billion.)

LaCroix also noted that even though 11 large U.S. banks put an
"extraordinary facility," together depositing $30 billion into a
troubled U.S. regional bank, First Republic, the move on Thursday did
little to calm down the bank's investors on Friday. (Shares fell 33
percent on Friday, and Moody's downgraded the bank's credit ratings.)

In addition, the Wall Street Journal and other financial publications
reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department
of Justice had launched separate probes of the SVB collapse.

"In 2008, the Bear Stearns [collapse] was in March. The FDIC negotiated
a buyout by JPMorgan, and everybody kind of went back to sleep. But then
Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008. That in and of itself makes me
very wary of saying that we can sound the all-clear."

"I just don't think we can say that we dodged a bullet. We dodged the
immediate problem that would've emerged on Monday, had the federal
government not taken those steps, but that didn't end the crisis. It's
still too early to say how it's going to unfold. For starters, there is
going to be a significant [D&O] loss on SVB, possibly on Signature Bank,
possibly on Credit Suisse. Even for what's already on the table, we know
there's going to be consequences. The problem is, how bad do the
consequences get?"

Reasoned LaCroix: "We dodged the first salvo, but the battle isn't over.
We could escape with relatively little damage, just the claims that are
on the table so far. But in 2008, the Bear Stearns [collapse] was in
March. The FDIC negotiated a buyout by JPMorgan, and everybody kind of
went back to sleep. But then Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008."

"That in and of itself makes me very wary of saying that we can sound
the all-clear-that we can be sure that we've dodged the worst of it,"
LaCroix said.

More Startup Troubles Ahead: CB Insights

Beyond financial institutions themselves, startups that held deposits
with SVB were spared some of the worst consequences of not being able to
access their funds, such as not being able to make payroll last week.
But financial stresses may be looming over the longer term for
venture-backed tech companies, according to a research report published
by CB Insights last week. The report's title, "SVB's challenges will
accelerate valuation down rounds, startup mortality, and layoffs"
envisions the types of financial consequences-failures and layoffs-that
could turn into D&O and employment practices liability claims, although
it doesn't specifically mention any management liability insurance
ramifications.

The main focus of the CB Insights analysis is the idea that "the tenuous
state of Silicon Valley Bank will change the accessibility of venture
debt." In short, the research firm highlights the removal of a huge
provider of these loans, SVB, as the next domino to fall, setting a
string of future startup failures and job cuts in motion.

SVB defines venture debt on its website as "a loan designed for
fast-growing investor-backed startups,...most often...secured at the
same time or soon after an equity round-and is typically used to extend
runway to the next round."

"Venture debt reduces the average cost of the capital to fund operations
when a company is scaling quickly or burning cash. It also provides
flexibility, since venture debt can be used as a cash cushion against
operational glitches, hiccups in fundraising and unforeseen capital
needs," the website says. Elsewhere on the SVB website, an article
titled "Venture Debt: How it Works" refers to venture debt as "
performance insurance" that can be used as a short-term bridge to the
next round of equity.

The CB Insights report, citing an SVB presentation published on March 8,
highlighted venture debt as a preferred fund raising tool over the past
year. "Clients continue to opt for debt over raising equity at pressured
valuations," the SVB presentation says (page 17).

This activity, CB Insights says, helps explain why private market
valuations haven't shown the same sharp declines as public market
valuations. According to CB Insights research data, while private tech
valuations in fourth-quarter 2022 fell modestly from heights recorded in
2021, they were actually up compared to 2020 across all financing
stages. In fact, for just late stages, such as Series C and Series D,
valuations climbed 20 and 30 percent.

"It's feasible that companies with momentum and metrics were the ones
raising in the more challenging climate of the past year, and so they
might still have been able to command premium valuations. But companies
that didn't have the metrics were availing themselves of debt to avoid
'pressured valuations,' as SVB noted," the CB Insights report says.
"Debt helped companies delay taking the medicine of a lower valuation,
dilution, and tough conversations with the team. In some cases, it also
helped companies avoid (or perhaps delay) layoffs or even failure
because of an inability to raise equity capital."

Without venture debt available from SVB, the CB Insights report suggests
that instead of the 20-30 percent increases in late-stage valuations,
private market valuations will fall as far, or farther, than public
market valuations. The research firm's data reveals the combined market
cap of the 50 largest tech IPOs since 2020 is down 59 percent, and that
90 percent of the top 20 tech IPOs currently trade lower than their IPO
valuations.

Bolstering its overall forecast of a financial debacle on the horizon in
startup land, CB Insights also notes that:

-   Overall dealmaking has been slowing even with venture debt available
    capital.

1.  The time between funding rounds has been lengthening as investors
    become more discerning.

1.  Startups have been burning cash. One piece of evidence-86 percent of
    unicorns increased employee headcount since first-quarter 2022.

Another View

Travis Hedge, a co-founder of Vouch, an InsurTech that specializes in
commercial insurance, including D&O, as an MGU and a reinsurer, believes
that venture debt has become less popular in recent years because of the
availability of equity financing in the market. Before co-founding Vouch
in 2018, Hedge worked as investor for SVB Capital, and before that, he
helped to build out the Nationwide Ventures team where SVB Capital was
the first investment the insurer's venture arm made.

"Venture debt has been around for the last 40 years or so. As a matter
of fact, if you go back to the 90s and early 2000s, there were dedicated
leasing functions for things like office equipment. There were debts
specifically for the capital needs of these startups," Hedge reported.

"The industry has actually evolved quite a bit. Venture debt is
important, but it's actually one of many tools available to companies
now. As all kinds of options have matured, you've seen more and more
providers come into the market. There's a lot more options out there for
companies today in terms of financing than there were 10, 15, 20 years
ago," Hedge said.

While Hedge agreed that venture debt is "absolutely an important part"
of the overall funding ecosystem, "the point that I take away there from
CB Insights is that it's not just about the venture debt. It's about the
role that SVB plays in the entire ecosystem," he said, reacting to
Carrier Management's summary of the report highlights, having not
actually seen the report. "We've already seen over the last 12 months,
it's been a more challenging funding environment as equity capital in
general has become less available, and capital, just across the board,
has become more constrained."

"It has been a more challenging fundraising environment for startups for
the last 12 months," he affirmed. "Who knows how the markets [would]
respond had we not seen the Fed action last week?"

Beyond impacts on funding availability to the startup market, SVB's
collapse, absent government intervention, could have had broader impacts
"within the startup ecosystem that might have implications on the health
of companies overall. It's arguably not very different from what we've
seen in other points of the cycle. That is just normal kind of economic
volatility," Hedge said.

Vouch Co-Founder Sam Hodges added his view that over the last year there
has been "a renormalization of venture capital activity back to more of
what it looked like in 2017, 2018."

"You have to remember, 2020 and 2021 were outlier years. There was a
tremendous amount of capital that had flooded into the space, and that
capital really started to recede 12 or 13 months ago," Hodges said. "I
think we've already seen a lot of these effects show up in the market."

From a D&O underwriting perspective, Vouch is "very plugged in with the
ecosystem and can stay ahead of these trends," he added. "In terms of
how we thought about underwriting and rating, we made sure we were
making adjustments as of a year ago."

Bottom line, "I don't think that those shifts are new," he said,
referring to changes in levels of funding activity. "They've been in the
works for some time."

Added Hedge: "Given the moves that the Fed made last week, we wouldn't
see the knock-on implications from a D&O perspective. But I think our
team was very prepared to respond if and when that became an issue."

What If?

While neither of the Vouch executives could be coaxed to imagine the
potential lawsuits and liability insurance loss scenarios that might
have played out in the event the federal government hadn't acted to
secure SVB deposits last week, LaCroix did entertain Carrier
Management's questions. In particular, we wondered about reports from
entrepreneurs suggesting there they were contractually bound to deposit
money in the bank as a condition of funding. (See, for example, "How I
Kept My Company Afloat During the Silicon Valley Bank Meltdown" on
Inc.com and "Silicon Valley Bank signed exclusive banking deals with
some clients" on cnbc.com) Could those contractual provisions have put
the bank or venture capital firms recommending SVB in the crosshairs of
plaintiffs lawyers?

"As I understood it, those kind of arrangements, where the SVB would
extend credit in exchange for an agreement by the borrower to put all of
its banking with SVB, permitted SVB to make the loan on a
non-collateralized basis," LaCroix said. In other words, "it was
attractive to the borrower. They were going to get the credit they
needed, and they needed to bank with somebody. If they just agreed to
bank with SVB, they didn't have to post collateral...It's not as
nefarious as it seems, and a lot of banks do that," he said.

Taking the question in a slightly different direction, LaCroix said that
"SVB had the advantage, because frequently they were willing to lend to
startups where perhaps others might not. Would those borrowers, because
they couldn't get access to their deposits, have a cause of action
against SVB?"

Without knowing more about the contractual relationship, LaCroix said,
"it would depend a lot on the total circumstances around the loan. It
was advantageous both ways. It wasn't just a unilaterally-advantageous
arrangement."

LaCroix continued: "The question I have is, had the Fed not stepped in,
[then for] startups that had deposits in excess of the maximum insurance
amount, if they had adverse business developments because they couldn't
get access to their funds, would shareholders have had a claim against
the executives of those institutions for their poor treasury practices
and [for] doing their banking in such a way that they exceeded the
limit?"

Admitting that he doesn't know the answer to the question, he offered,
"There would've been a lot of reasons that people would've been mad, and
there certainly would've been a lot of claims, perhaps some of them on a
novel theory..."

"In a crisis, all theories are on the table. That doesn't mean
necessarily that it would've gotten anywhere. But I think if it got bad
enough, there could well have been claims like that."

D&O Market Reaction

With one shareholder suit against SVB already filed and the potential of
more suits on the horizon, the D&O insurance market did hit the pause
button temporarily, LaCroix reported.

"Earlier this week, everybody was just a little bit on hold," he said,
referring mainly to the reactions of D&O underwriters involved in the FI
space. "I think they were just trying to get their bearings, trying to
catch their breath," he said.

While he reported hearing that at least one carrier had pulled open
quotes and was temporarily not issuing any terms, even on their own
renewals, LaCroix himself didn't experience this. "I met with the head
of one of the leading D&O markets for financial institutions [who] said
as far as they were concerned, they were still open for business. They
were still quoting business, particularly on their own renewals."

"They certainly were going to review their underwriting guidelines and
be wary of banks that had certain characteristics," he said, referring
to factors like size or narrow concentrations, like SVB or like
Signature Bank, "which rather publicly was going after crypto accounts."

"Wary is probably a good description" of the D&O market reaction, he
said.

"As the week has unfolded, I think the reactions have evolved as well."
Pointing to the Signature Bank, Credit Suisse and First Republic
situation, he said that "there's a clear indication that this could
continue to unfold. And that could continue to alter the dynamic and
alter the marketplace."

Still, LaCroix doesn't see recent events changing the overall market for
commercial D&O beyond FI. "At least for now, I think that will continue
on as it was, which was reasonably competitive, with a lot of capacity."

In the FI space, "there's no doubt the underwriting process is going to
be lengthened, [and carriers] may be hesitant to extend as much capacity
as they have. They may take action on pricing. It's all going to unfold"
as the world gets answers to the question of whether there will be more
bank failures. "If that's the case, you could see a more pronounced
reaction by the carriers in the FI space."

What about reactions by insurers providing private company management
liability?

"For now, it's going to operate as it was...A lot of banking
institutions are privately held, [and they] will have to deal with a
more cautious marketplace. But outside of that space, I think the
private company space for commercial D&O remains as it was, which is
competitive, with ample capacity, on terms that are more attractive than
they were 12 months ago."

"I don't think that's going to change unless we start to see
consequences from the banking turmoil that spills outside the banking
industry and starts to affect depositors, customers, and so on," LaCroix
concluded. "Things would have to get worse and broader. The turmoil
would have to spread."

LaCroix went on to distinguish the causes of the current turmoil for
banks to the causes fueling the global financial crisis and the S&L
crisis. In the earlier events it was bank lending operations that caused
the problems. "It was bad loans. Here, what got SVB [in trouble] was
really its treasury operations, managing its bond portfolios-really
fundamental banking."

"Do we have an industrywide vulnerability? I think we all have to just
wait and see."

He agreed that financial underwriting questions for non-bank insureds
may expand to include questions about banking practices, and also just
credit generally: "'What are your sources of credit? Have you checked in
on it? What are your alternatives if that dries up or if you exhaust
that?' There will be questions like that. There's no doubt."

LaCroix, who ran a D&O underwriting facility earlier in his career, said
that from an underwriting standpoint he would be worried about any
interest-rate-sensitive businesses, pointing to the fact that SVB's
downfall was structuring its bond portfolio with unhedged interest rate
risk, and also about companies that loaded up on debt when borrowing
costs were low.

"Now, some deficiencies in your operations and performance, which you
might have been able to mask with easy borrowing, you might not be able
to paper over anymore," he said, suggesting that he would change his
underwriting guidelines for debt-sensitive and debt-heavy businesses.
Asked what sectors fall in these categories, LaCroix offered retail and
transportation businesses among those where operational costs are high.

At Vouch, where the focus is the same high-growth entrepreneurial
companies that banked at SVB, Hodges said, "This past week has been a
bit of a tabletop exercise in risk management for everyone who's been in
the space," when asked about lessons for insureds beyond keeping bank
deposits below the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit.

"Counterparty risk and business continuity risk always should be on the
list of things you are thinking about when you build and run a company,"
he said.

"Part of our role at Vouch is to help entrepreneurs manage their most
important risks. We historically have offered risk reports and thoughts
on market trends that we're aware of. We certainly think that there's
some really interesting lessons here, particularly for companies in the
treasury management and counterparty management space. The conversations
I've been having with entrepreneurs and investors over the past week, to
me, indicate that a lot of folks are really taking those to heart."

Asked about the tenor of the D&O market generally, Hedge said it was
hard to comment on how carriers across the broad market are reacting.
"It has been a volatile market in the D&O world for the last few years.
I think we, as well as many others, are actually just very closely
monitoring this situation right now."

Added Hodges, "D&O, like many other liability lines, is a dynamic space.
If you are providing coverage or underwriting in that space, you need to
be responsive to risk trend and risk development, make sure you're
getting coverage underwriting and rating done properly. I think everyone
takes that to heart. Certainly, when there are risk events in the market
at a high level, you always take a step back and think about what might
you want to do a little bit differently as you adjust your go-forward
plan."

How an MBA in Entrepreneurship can make you a future leader

Body

Almost, if not every, English language dictionary defines an
entrepreneur as a person who sets up a business at their own risk, with
the view of making a profit. Definitions have a tendency to highlight
the cold logic of a word, rather than capture its essence - casting
aside the drive, the passion, the epiphanies, the solution-finding and
the 'dreaming it big' elements, which lie at the heart of the most
entrepreneurial spirit. Moreover, not every entrepreneur is necessarily
seeking profit; however, what is essential to the definition of an
entrepreneur, is the risk taken to achieve his or her ambition.

Risk is, of course, something that needs to be assessed very carefully,
and most business people will do their utmost to try and diminish it.
This is where an MBA qualification can present itself as a
knowledge-enhancing, risk-reducing tool.

In the same breath, it is very important to consider the nature of the
business being launched. It may be that the outlay of a business setup
is low, say the invention is an innovative new phone app, and there's a
chance a similar app could enter the market - this is an instance where
an MBA qualification may not present itself as the best option. However,
for those budding entrepreneurs who have a longer-term goal, an MBA in
entrepreneurship can help give a project its best chance of success.
Here are three benefits to taking the qualification.

1. Building solid foundations through an MBA in entrepreneurship

Top business schools offering an MBA in entrepreneurship draw on
specialised resources aimed at setting their students and their business
projects on the right trajectory. Candidates learn from professors with
an in-depth knowledge of the processes and workings of entrepreneurial
activity, much of which they will have developed through targeted
research or through their own experience as entrepreneurs.

Under 'faculty', Harvard Business School, for example, lists its
academics, and immediately beneath, all of its entrepreneurs in
residence - each one of whom is a member of the school's entrepreneurial
management team. Not only are professors and faculty helping their
students plan for or launch their prospective businesses, they also aim
to impart the tools and know-how to best help new ventures succeed
beyond the 'intrepid startup' stage.

Courses such as 'opportunity identification and evaluation', 'venture
capital', 'innovation and design experience', and 'entrepreneurial
finance and equity' are the sort of topics you can expect to find
covered in an MBA-level entrepreneurship curriculum.

It's also worth noting that entrepreneurship training at top business
schools doesn't limit you to setting up your own business. An MBA in
entrepreneurship can prepare graduates to work across a variety of
career paths and in areas which include (but are not limited to)
corporate innovation and business development; emerging/expanding
companies; entrepreneurship through small business acquisition;
consulting, social entrepreneurship and venture capital/private equity.

Learn about diverse MBA programs available at the#QSMBATOUR. Sign up
herefor your opportunity to meet with admissions directors from top
business schools.

2. Top business schools and their love affair with innovation hubs and
labs

While there are many career avenues open to those with an MBA in
entrepreneurship, the crux of the matter is that approximately 30
percent of applicants choose an MBA qualification because they are
interested in setting up their own business.

Rather than take a direct plunge, they expect (rightly) that business
schools will better equip them to succeed. No budding entrepreneur wants
to fail in their startup venture, and while failure is often extremely
formative, it can come at a high cost. Top business schools, therefore,
aim to offer their MBA candidates a means to test-drive ideas by giving
them a semi-controlled and stable environment to work in. If scientists
can do it, why not business people?

Today, there are more innovation centers, startup labs/incubators and
enterprise hubs than ever before. Business schools appear to be on a
quest to shepherd pioneering minds, converging them in one place where
they can bat ideas and let innovation mushroom. Proposals are evaluated
by faculty and peers, some will be put into action and a project might
come into fruition, or it may fall at the final few hurdles. For the
instances in which things do go wrong, there is a friendly team that can
help isolate shortcomings allowing the next business model and future
projects to be further refined.

Some of the better-known startup facilities include the Columbia Startup
Lab, Harvard Innovation Lab, Stanford Venture Studio, Tuck School of
Business' DEN Innovation Center and the Imperial College Enterprise Lab.
This list is in no way exclusive, but provides an example of the sort of
environments that are open to those who study an MBA in
entrepreneurship, both during the program and, once they graduate, as
alumni.

3. MBA networking expands entrepreneurship opportunities

Like-minded people with similar goals pooling ideas and sharing their
existing knowledge - this is the sort of experience an MBA in
entrepreneurship at one of the world's top business schools can offer.
It's one which is likely to give candidates with an MBA qualification a
distinct advantage over their peers.

MBA networking and relationship building is one of the main reasons many
students opt for business schools. Not only are students engaging with
their cohort, but they also have opportunities to work with new partners
beyond campus confines. Business schools have the capacity to put their
students in touch with venture capitalists and angel investors, and MBA
candidates are themselves often enticed by the lure of investment. At
Wharton, for example, students have the opportunity to become investment
associates with Wharton Impact Investing Partners, and at Harvard
Business School, students can join Rock Venture Partners, to learn about
investing in startups.

MBA networking may begin at enrollment (and sometimes even a little
before!), but access to a global network is there for an entire
lifetime. Harvard Business School's Rock Accelerator program, for
example, brings together MBA student founders to work on "high-potential
early-stage startups." Not only are cohorts studying together, but they
are also taking their business ventures forward as teams, meaning
longer-term commitment and working relationships that bloom in the
months and years ahead, if all goes well.

Many top business schools offer a vast array of programs, competitions,
and resources dedicated to the needs of their student entrepreneurs. The
opportunities for engagement and MBA networking are plentiful if you
choose to participate.

Engage with the best global business schools

The #QSMBATOUR gives you an opportunity to meet and network with leading
international and Indian business schools like Sydney Business School,
SMU, Rotterdam, IE, Durham, Henley, Newcastle, Hult, IIM-B, ISB,
York-Schulich, Thunderbird and many more across India from May 19-26,
2019.

Five 'Dead Startups' from Juicero to Coolest Cooler parodied as toys

July 14 -- For its latest drop, internet collective MSCHF is releasing
five famous startup failures as miniature toys for $40 each, or $160 for
a set. The Dead Startup Toys drop is comprised of the Juicero juicer,
the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) rugged laptop, Theranos miniLab, Jibo
social robot, and the Coolest Cooler, which MSCHF calls the "poster
child for the pitfalls of crowdfunding."

"This is not a memorialization," MSCHF says, "but perhaps they are a
form of necromancy: we celebrate their pale shadows, deprived of their
original context." Describing the toys as the equivalent to "a line of
heads on stakes," MSCHF invites us to "behold these beautiful mutants,
hoisted on petards of their own solid-aluminum-unibody construction."

The failures range from the overly ambitious and misguided One Laptop
Per Child project - which attempted to build an open-source $100 laptop
for use by children in the developing world - to the Juicero juicer,
which squeezed proprietary bags of pre-prepared juice roughly as well as
a pair of human hands. Then there's the Coolest Cooler, a do-too-much
cooler that went through a chaotically mismanaged crowdfunding campaign.
Rounding out the collection are toys based on the Jibo social robot
(which had "little to no practical functionality," according to MSCHF)
and the Theranos miniLab, a printer-sized blood-testing machine that the
company fraudulently claimed would diagnose a range of illnesses.

 

Many of MSCHF's previous projects have raised the ire of the companies
they've parodied. It recently initiated a "voluntary recall" of its run
of unofficially modified Satan-themed sneakers in response to a
trademark dispute from Nike. It also received pushback from Boston
Dynamics after it strapped a paintball gun to the back of one of the
company's Spot robot dogs and let members of the public control it in an
art gallery. "We condemn the portrayal of our technology in any way that
promotes violence, harm, or intimidation," Boston Dynamics said at the
time.

In our wrap-up article on PDF 2019, we provide a broad overview ofdesign
metaphors, partnerships, education, and emerging trends.

Organised by the Association of Designers of India (ADI), the 13th
annual Pune Design Festival (PDF) provided a number of inspiring and
actionable takeaways for design professionals and communities beyond.
Previous themes of PDF were Re.gen.e.rate (2012), Unlimited (2014),
Design X (2016), trans.form (2017), and Designism (2018).

This year's theme was COLLAB, derived from the word 'collaborative.' The
stimulating two-day event was packed with insights, debates, workshops,
movie screenings, exhibitions, networking breaks, and evening musical
performances.

For designers and the broader creative community, here are my top 16
takeaways from PDF 2019, on design metaphors, practice, partnerships,
purpose, traditions, education, and emerging trends.

Check out our &lt;em>d-Zen&lt;/em> (   https://yourstory.com/tag/d-zen)
('design Zen') section for in-depth book reviews, interviews, and expert
pieces as well.

1. Design language: descriptors and metaphors

A number of creative metaphors were offered for collaborative design,
such as trapeze (team PDF) and jugalbandi (Pavitra Rajaram). But
unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a word for design in Indian
languages, according to Ashoke Chatterjee, former director of NID.

"Design is the ability to see the world through other people's eyes," he
said. But without a values-based foundation, the profession in India
will "climb up the stairs backwards", he cautioned.

Kedar Nimkar, Design Head at BookMyShow and Founder of Audiogyan, has
documented design attributes from a range of experts, such as
sensitivity, patience, perseverance, empathy and rebelliousness.
Creativity thrives under conditions of freedom as well as constraints,
and design is a combination of push and pull factors.

"Design is a network builder, driver of collaborative creativity, and
voice of the company to the customer," said Kevin Gilboe, Head of
Design, Asia-Pacific, 3M. Designers can also act as 'internal
intrapreneurs' in their organisations. "Design is a leadership
function," he added.

2. Accept criticism and even rudeness

Collaboration in creative projects calls for free-ranging opinions,
positions and debate. Musician Vasu Dixit shared a number of
collaborative video projects, including one with Shubha Mudgal where the
musicians emphasised that rudeness has a place right alongside
politeness in effective collaboration.

Friction, disagreement and arguments lead to good ideas, and should not
be discouraged. Pankaj Jhunja, Head of Mobility Services at Tata Motors,
joked that French people may seem worse than Indians when having
arguments - but they only take it professionally, unlike Indians who
take criticism personally.

3. Designers as innovation partners

Design helps generate insights that power opportunities for innovation,
according to Michael Foley, Founder of Foley Designs. Design firms can
be piloting vehicles for innovation, he said, showing examples of his
designs for cooling devices in helmets, developed by a Pune startup.

Designers can create experiential touchpoints, and enable arms-reach
innovation. Design helps products become intuitive, with short learning
curves and easy adoption, he added. It can also help innovations have an
impact that is instant, long-term, and scalable.

4. Design inspired by nature

"Humans create experiences. Nature is experience," said Maggie MacNab,
author of the books Design by Nature and Decoding Design, and the video
Designing Effective Logos. She has also served as President of the
Communication Artists of New Mexico.

Maggie explored the relationships between nature, art, mathematics and
design, such as the Fibonacci series in sunflower floret patterns.
Patterns store, distribute and connect energy in interesting ways, she
explained. Everyday patterns of curves and lines can connect with brand
and logo designs in diverse ways. For example, angles reflect stability
and are used in logos of banks.

5. Traditions and contradictions in India

The expression of modernity in India is different from the Western model
of organised and clean cities, joked Santosh Desai, CEO of Future
Brands, and author of the Times of India column City City Bang Bang. His
book, Mother Pious Lady - Making Sense of Everyday India examines the
daily life of middle-class India.

India is a bundle of design contradictions, with cities like Bengaluru
being both a global hi-tech hub as well as a messy jumble of traffic and
pollution, Santosh observed. "We are blind to many absurdities," he
said, regaling the audience with photographs of couples using umbrellas
to create semi-private zones in parks, and ads on rickshaws.

Management is a pseudo-discipline with limited ecological understanding,
Santosh said. He urged designers to handle MBAs on their team as if they
were a "design problem".

6. Conceptual design

New frontiers were presented from seemingly traditional fields such as
puppetry and book publishing. Dadi Pudumjee, Founder of the Ishara
Puppet Theatre Trust and President of UNIMA (International Union of
Puppeteers), showed how puppets can reflect traditional folklore while
also being re-designed for contemporary settings and themes. New designs
have even included internal lights and international collaboration.

Photographer, author and artist Dayanita Singh showed how photographs
can actually be raw material for other works of art such as foldable
"book objects", mobile museums, and catalogues. She showed how her
photographs can be curated, sequenced, and displayed in a wide range of
settings, but giving her full control of the final display. With
creative collaborators, she has ventured into new poetic and narrative
domains, as seen in her books such as Myself, Mona Ahmed.

7. Digital frontiers

Art forms like photography have easily gone digital, observed Dayanita
Singh. "Photography takes you where there are no words or languages,"
she explained. There is so much photography now in the online world that
it forces photographers to do even more to stand out, she added.
"Photography starts now," she evocatively said.

Parveez Nasyam, CEO of Xenium Digital, shared examples of experiential
marketing using AR for clients like Grohe. Immersive media can help
brands communicate more effectively with the user.

The rise of streaming media is transforming the music, TV and movie
industry. Audiences are also being roped in as collaborators in
experimental and interactive movies, though purists may claim that this
distorts the integrity of the story.

While digital media open up new opportunities for personal productivity
and global connections, they also throw up a host of challenges for
designers with respect to IP, privacy, security, safety, addiction, and
fake news.

8. Become a 'designpreneur'

Panellists from Tie Pune, Globant, The Label Life, and Moonshine Meadery
shared insights on the startup opportunity for designers, and the scope
for collaboration between designers and entrepreneurs (see panel
coverage here (/2019/01/design-entrepreneurs-collaborate/)). No field is
off-limits for an entrepreneur, and designers can become trend-setters
rather than trend-followers.

The failure rate of startups and creative projects like Bollywood movies
is estimated at over 80 percent. Entrepreneurship calls for resilience
and being able to withstand challenges and bounce back from failure.
Moonshine Meadery almost shut down five times during its journey but has
survived. The founders are committed to seeing the brand thrive in the
long run, even if they may not own it.

9. Connect to a higher purpose

Designers have made notable contributions to livelihood, endangered
crafts, and environmental sustainability, such as Commitment to Kashmir
(Shruti Jagota Mittal), Bambu Studio (A.G. Rao), Good Earth (Pavitra
Rajaram), Anandwan Smart Village (Gautam Karajgi) and PMNCH (Anthony
Lopez).

Service, dignity, and love should be the watchwords for designs today,
urged Ashoke Chatterjee, former Director of the National Institute of
Design (Ahmedabad), and Advisor, Centre for Heritage Management.
Empowerment, inclusion, and transformation can become a higher purpose
for designers (see earlier article here
(/2019/01/empowerment-inclusion-pune-design-festival/)).

10. Policies and education

"Recognition at the policy level that design is a game-changer remains
the biggest hurdle. Though we have a National Design Policy and India
Design Council, the field receives scant attention. Make in India will
not succeed unless we prefix it with design," cautioned ADI President
Ashish Deshpande.

"Design education needs to be made robust and relevant. With a
burgeoning education scenario unfolding, it becomes important to have a
good faculty development program and focus on its quality," Ashish
added.

He recommended that the India Design Council release the Design
Education Quality Mark framework. "Good quality in design education is
essential to develop a strong and innovative platform of professionals
serving the industry," he advised. There should also be a promotion of
skills and programmes to the masses.

Debates during the discussion sessions at the conference focused on the
'messiness' of needing government support for design but without
politicisation and bureaucracy, the need for permanent faculty in design
schools but not without a commitment to innovation, and having 'world
class' design education but without being a copy of Western models.

11. The dark side: censorship

Design also plays a large role in the movie industry. However, Bollywood
screenwriter Anjum Rajabali (Ghulam, The Legend of Bhagat Singh,
Raajneeti), cautioned that the issue of creative freedom has opened up
fissures in society, with prejudices and hate being drummed up for
political reasons.

Extra-constitutional moral police are being unleashed on artists, and
self-censorship is spreading. "There is a wave of anxiety and
nervousness," lamented Anjum, who is also a senior activist of the
Screenwriters Association.

12. Collaboration: industry and international

A number of speakers called for design collaborations between companies,
industries and countries. Urban designer William Harald-Wong from
Malaysia founded the Design Alliance Asia (tDA Asia) in 2000, a
collaborative network represented in 14 Asian countries. "Asia is where
the future of design will be," he said.

ADI has a number of collaborations with Nasscom, IIID, World Design
Organisation, and India Design Council. ADI is a pan-India body,
registered as a society. It has five city chapters and one student
chapter. There are special events organised on the occasion of World
Design Day, World Industrial Design Day, Design Mixers and Bangalore
Design Week, said ADI president Ashish Deshpande.

13. Show, don't just tell

In addition to the two-day conference, PDF featured the third annual
Design Expo (/2019/01/design-expo-pune-design-festival/) showcasing the
work of participants from the design ecosystem: product firms,
educational institutes, material vendors, and service providers. There
was also an Open House option for conference attendees to visit design
establishments in Pune (Elephant Design, Ka-Sha, Ticket Design, Dominix,
Lemon Design, Studio Mars, Setu, Tifa, Innofy).

Such exhibitions and site visits help put a 'face' to design and go
beyond the conceptual discussions and case study presentations of
conference tracks. They are more interactive and make for better
networking as well.

14. Award design excellence

It is important for professional communities to recognise and award
excellence through rigorous and objective criteria. They advance the
field and also serve as a chronicle of a country's design journey. PDF
2019 featured memorial lectures, citation awards for educators, and two
sets of excellence awards: Lexus Design Awards India and Battle of the
Student Projects.

The Lexus awards showcase the company's international passion for design
and innovation beyond aesthetics, and recognise social impact and
inclusion as well. Award categories include furniture, traditional
items, lifestyle accessories, packaging, public utility, textiles, and
business impact.

15. Connect to the next generation

PDF also featured mentoring sessions and a programme called Gen-D
(Generation Design Programme) for students and aspiring entrepreneurs.
Panels addressed issues like career options, and there were
opportunities for new designers to connect with industry experts and
academics.

Student tickets were discounted, and students asked a number of
questions in the conference track as well. There was also a competition
called Battle of the Student Projects,
(http://www.adiawards.org/battle-of-projects-2019-shortlisted-entries/)
with awards given in categories such as UI, graphic, industrial,
transportation, experiential space, craft and lifestyle design.

16. Nurture design hubs

The community of Pune-based designers has helped make the city a hub for
design; the first PDF was held in 2006, and now has ADI's Pune chapter
as the key driver. "We celebrate work from India as well as abroad,"
said Balkrishna Mahajan, President of ADI's Pune chapter and Founder of
Ticket Design.

There are open opportunities for other cities, towns, and even villages
in India to position themselves as design hubs for a range of sectors
and competency areas. "We need numerous India Design Centres to pop up
at metro, city, and taluka level to reach out to the people," summed up
ADI's Ashish Deshpande. May a million designers bloom!

[Matrix Moments] Go-to-market helps with the goal of reaching the
product-market fit, says Avnish Bajaj of Matrix Partners India

In this episode of #MatrixMoments, Avnish Bajaj, Founder and Managing
Director, Matrix Partners India, talks about the difference between
Product-Market Fit (PMF) and Go-to-Market (GTM), and what works best
when.

With the current coronavirus pandemic, several sectors have been
negatively impacted. For startups, what matters now is how do they go to
the market after the lockdown, and how will it work.

In this episode of Matrix Moments, Avnish Bajaj, Founder and Managing
Director, Matrix Partners India, talks about both product-market fit
(PMF) and go-to-market, and what works best when.

Avnish says, "While PMF determines the success or failure of a startup,
the GTM is your risk management strategy towards PMF. Businesses have
started to get PMF. You are trying to attack a certain market. You
believe there is a gap in that market and are building a product to
address that gap. That is the PMF. But it's far harder than it appears."

He goes on to explains, "First you have to develop the product, and then
you have to aim it at the right place in the market, which is the GTM.
And then hopefully the fit happens. Essentially, in a sports analogy,
PMF is your goal, and GTM is that entire play to get to that goal. Who
is passing the ball where, and offence, defence, where you are, how are
you passing the ball between various phases of the businesses."

How does GTM help?

Avnish says, many entrepreneurs do not think through GTM enough. But if
you think through your GTM correctly, it can accelerate the PMF or can
also give you warning signals early on. Thus, GTM helps you with your
goal of reaching the PMF.

GTM is the marketing approach and it is the internet world's way of
defining the 4Ps - price, placement, promotion, and product. How are you
positioning your product in the market? The pricing decisions, and how
are you promoting the product.

"Analyse your customers or consumers' pain points and then think about
how best to position. Therefore, that is the outside-in approach," says
Avnish.

Is it important for an entrepreneur to think of their GTM strategy
differently for an enterprise and software company? Avnish explains,
while strategically speaking no, tactically speaking it is yes.

Ultimately, the purpose of GTM for enterprise and consumer businesses
are the same, but tactically it becomes apples and oranges. Typically,
in enterprise, it's more B2B, and more sales led. And in consumer, it is
more marketing led.

Therefore, you will have inside sales or sales people-driven GTM, and
you will have more of the consumer driven.

"The beauty of the last five to 10 years is these things are converging.
So, there is something called the consumerisation of the enterprise.
This is largely led because everything is becoming digital, says Avnish.

Getting the best of both worlds

Avnish explains that in today's world, one can combine the best
practices of the enterprise side into a consumer company, and the best
practices of consumer into an enterprise company.

Citing an example of PayPal as a company with best GTM, Avnish says,
PayPal in 1999 said you can pay each other, and the company would give
you $5 to send money to another person, and they would get an email
saying, ABC has sent you $5, click on this link to receive it. "Who
wouldn't do it? It was the ultimate viral product probably of the last
two to three decades. Just caught fire," says Avnish. He adds that it
was a go-to-market strategy and not product market fit.

"The product market fit that PayPal had was to pay each other and pay on
the internet, which was a massive value addition. So, you had this
outstanding go-to-market strategy sitting on top of an outstanding
product market fit, you have a winning strategy. They had these two
viral things firing and it became a very valuable company very early,"
adds Avnish.

All this comes from the traditional consumer product companies like Coco
Cola and Pepsi that would give trail packages. This is the internet view
of a trip package.

"Excellent GTM cannot solve for a bad PMF. An excellent GTM or a good
GTM can explode an excellent PMF or a good PMF. So, they have a great
product," says Avnish.

Body

An aspiring entrepreneur or someone who has met with startup failure in
the past will agree that starting a business on your own can be
intimidating. Not all of us have the financial means or courage to quit
our jobs and get started on our dream ventures right away. Adding to the
self-doubt are the well-documented risks in entrepreneurship, the
stories of startups that crashed and burned, and elusive success stories

The question then we often find asking ourselves is - How can I
translate my brilliant ideas into a successful early stage startup?

Well, there is no easy answer. There is no one way.

But, the fact is you need to prepare, launch and grow a business. For
this, you need to develop entrepreneurial skills and expertise. You need
to learn the necessary startup tools and frameworks. You need to
articulate the vision for the startup. All of which will help you take
the first step with confidence and greater chances of finding success.

The Entrepreneurial Edge programme by London Business School has been
designed to help aspiring or first-time entrepreneurs.

An intensive 12-week venture development journey with mentoring and
support, The Entrepreneurial Edge helps prospective entrepreneurs
kickstart successful early stage ventures. As part of the programme,
participants build and launch business ideas, learn tools and
frameworks, evaluate market opportunities, create a viable business
model and financial plan. The programme also helps you ask and get
answers to the important financial questions that you need to know to
write a business plan and win over investors.

Interestingly, the programme not only helps aspiring entrepreneurs
create their first startup, but also aims to help serial entrepreneurs
refine their techniques, as well as corporate professionals reinvigorate
their career with entrepreneurial thinking.

10 key reasons why this online programme is like no other

An experiential learning programme

The programme design enables participants to adopt a practical weekly
regiment of activities week after week. The process is as follows

1. Learn: Intensive faculty-led-online masterclasses, Industry expert
online interviews & Founder's insights

2. Discuss: Interactive sessions with your course director

3. Apply: Prepare one pitch deck slide

4. Pitch: Share individual submissions and pitch to your mentor

5. Refine: Evolve the idea based on feedback from your mentor and
support group

A programme where the course director plays a key role

Adam Davies, the Programme Lead of the View Entrepreneurship course at
University of Oxford, who is also the visitor professor for
entrepreneurship at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad and Programme
Lead at Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, Spark Accelerator, heads The
Entrepreneurial Edge programme as the course director and lead mentor.
Each week Adam will take the participants step-by-step, through the key
concepts, including live online sessions, before opening access to a
wide range of exclusive insights and support.

Weekly feedback from expert mentors

The London Business School's Entrepreneurship Edge provides participants
with weekly feedback from experienced mentors. The programme offers 12
weekly live interactions with the mentor and support group for feedback
and guidance. The mentor guides, motivates, supports, encourages and
holds you accountable for ongoing progress towards your stated goals.
The mentors hold the weekly online sessions in small groups (maximum
five participants) to go through the week's learnings, provide feedback
on slide decks and other assignments, and answer participants'
questions.

Founder's insights, Live mentoring and learnings from industry experts

The programme offers 12 weekly, 75 minute interactive online classroom
sessions and 200 exclusive videos from leading experts. Eight startup
founders from across various stages will also share their in-depth
insights and learnings, bringing a real-life context to the theories and
academic research, and respond to detailed interview questions. Startup
advisors will also share their experience, learnings, and tips to
simplify tricky areas such as investment, intellectual property, and
legal structuring.

Weekly pitch practice

If there's one thing that is a key challenge for most aspiring
entrepreneurs, it is to create a winning investor pitch deck. With
everyone having a different perspective of what should go into it,
creating this deck can be a Herculean task for first-time entrepreneurs.
That's why the programme has been consciously designed to include an
iterative pitching process, wherein the teams evolve their business
ideas, launch strategy and venture's structure. Mentors will provide
feedback on participants' slides and their developing pitch decks.
Participants will also have the opportunity to provide and receive
constructive criticism to/from their support group each week, and even
work together on preparing slides, in some instances.* * *

Pitch to global investors

The programme culminates in a 'Pitch-Day' where selected teams are given
the opportunity to present their venture to an Investors' Committee
consisting of active venture capitalists, founders and angel investors
who invest in new ventures from around the world.

Strong cohort culture

Participants work in virtual groups with other founders, providing
feedback and support, and help with weekly assignments. This enables a
strong cohort culture with a network of peers, who often remain lifelong
friends.

A well-designed weekly module

The weekly modules have been designed to help the participants identify
legitimate business opportunities, gauge market demand and size of the
opportunity, define the business model, build an early stage management
team, identify an appropriate business plan, create a robust set of
financial projections, prepare a go to market strategy, acquire initial
customers and pitch for, and negotiate investment. The modules not only
introduces foundational frameworks and techniques on market research,
revenue models and cost structures but also covers concepts such as
opportunity costs for entrepreneurs, alternative financing methods,
including convertibles, crowd-funding and ICOs, among others

Seasoned mentors

Richard Branson, business magnate and Founder, Virgin Group, once said,
"If you ask any successful business person, they will always have had a
great mentor at some point along the road." This quote resonates with
many entrepreneurs. That's why London Business School's The
Entrepreneurial Edge programme ensures that participants have access to
stalwart mentors. This includes the leading authority on owner-managed
entrepreneurial businesses, Rupert Merson is the programme director and
lead faculty. Rupert is also the Adjunct Professor of Strategy and
Entrepreneurship BA and MA at Oxford University. The other key mentors
include David Arnold, Adjunct Professor of Marketing and a well-known
academician who is also the author of a number of books including The
Handbook of Brand Management; John Bates, the founder and a director of
Sussex Place Ventures Ltd and manager of London Business School's
in-house venture capital fund, and Julian Birkinshaw, Professor of
Strategy and Entrepreneurship and the Academic Director of the Institute
of Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

Commitment that is practical

One of the key reasons why so many people fail to complete online
programmes is because of the extensive commitment it requires from
participants. Often, participants have to spend many hours each day
doing coursework and reading. This is where the Edge programme stands
apart. Understanding the challenges of working professionals, the course
demands about five to eight hours of commitment every week. Most of the
learning happens within this time frame. If you were to break it down,
it doesn't require participants to spend more than an hour each day,
making it feasible for working professionals.

Lead by the world's learning company

The Entrepreneurial Edge programme by London Business School is being
brought to you by Pearson Professional Programs (PPP), one of the
world's leading learning company. PPP is recognised world over for
partnering with leading global educational institutions, faculty and
providers to help working professionals update their skills and progress
in their careers.

As with the Edge programme, Pearson is known for deploying cutting-edge
learning technology, classroom infrastructure and pedagogical methods
and each programme is carefully contextualised to speak to local
business realities.

With courses tailored to factor in the time that working professionals
can realistically commit towards learning, accompanied by byte-size
content, a high-touch learning experience, and experience, PPP scores
high on completion rate. In fact, its success has been high on this
front, with a 94.31 percent completion rate.

What IAMAI wants from Budget 2018: no angel tax, lower GST on digital
services

Yourstory.in

January 31, 2018 Wednesday 6:30 AM EST

Industry body IAMAI urges government to allow single GST registration
for digital services, seeks a level playing field for ecommerce
retailers.

With the Union Budget announcement round the corner, the Internet and
Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) highlighted five key tax-related
challenges that the digital sector expects to be addressed.

Angel tax: The valuation of startups is a critical factor, given the
intellectual property and other intangibles involved at the startup
stage. Most technology startups raise money before monetisation and
there is no underlying actual cash flow analysis available for
traditional valuation methods. Most startups are almost always asset
light and do not have assets in their books to justify their intrinsic
value.

Section 56[2] of the Finance Act 2012 (colloquially referred to as angel
tax) has resulted in numerous startups facing income tax notices
claiming a lion's share of the investments they raise as tax
liabilities, with a reported 53 percent drop in year-on-year private
angel investments and 80 percent drop in new startup incorporations in
the year 2017 as compared to 2016.

The main issue of contention is the valuation of the company or
calculating Fair Market Value (FMV) under Section 56(2). The valuation
is based on valuation certificate by a valuer recognised by the
government. Valuers in India look at traditional methods of valuation,
which apply to mature companies with regular cash flows.

The association stated that while the digital sector is not averse to
paying taxes, taxation should be on actualised gains and not notional
gains. Given the high rate of failure of startups, this is a critical
aspect of taxing the fast evolving tech sector, or we "run the risk of
killing the goose even before it lays a golden egg"!

Taxation of ESOPs: For digital startups initiating at an uncertain
stage, ESOPs are the most common and popular incentive offered to
employees at the stage of scaling up of business. From the employees'
perspective, in the context of liquidity of their stock, there is an
expectation that the company may go public or may be acquired by a
bigger player. This allows companies to attract the best talent, who are
also willing to take the risk of joining a startup.

Typically, most ESOPs have a vesting period (during which the employee
should continue to be in the employment of the company) and after
completion of the vesting period, the employee may exercise his option
to acquire shares by paying an exercise price. Under present provisions,
at the time of such exercise of options and grant of shares, the
difference between the FMV (Fair Market Value) of the shares and the
exercise price paid is taxed in the hands of the employee. The employer
is subject to withholding tax obligations on the same.

Unfortunately, when stock is issued under an ESOP scheme in startups,
there is no certainty on how much value/benefit may be realised when the
employee actually is able to sell the stock, or whether the employee
will at all be able to sell it, given that in most cases these are
unlisted stocks!

Thus, taxation of stock issued under an ESOP scheme is purely on a
notional basis, and in cases the taxable amount may be way higher than
the salary payable to the employees! Currently, employers either (a)
withhold from the monetary payments made to the employees (b) ask the
employees to furnish a cheque for the required amount, or in worst case
scenario (c) bear the tax cost themselves.

The association stated that ESOPs are an efficient way to remunerate and
incentivise employees to join startups and share the risk with the
founders. Keeping this in mind the high-risk scenario in which both
founders and employees work in a startup, the withholding tax should be
done away with and shares should only be taxed on realisation.

Multiple registration and filing under GST: Like all service sectors,
the digital sector is plagued by the challenge of state-wise multiple
registrations and filing burdens. What makes matters worse for the
digital sector is the fact that most Indian companies are startups that
simply do not have the bandwidth to undertake such exercises. IAMAI has
urged authorities to take note of this factor and allow single
registration for digital services, as has supposedly been proposed for
banking and financial services.

Anomaly in GST rates: Internet services digitalise conventional
services. For example, edutech provides education via digital platforms;
healthtech allows online doctor consultancy and ordering medicines, etc.
However, under GST, while education and health are tax-free, all digital
services are taxed at 18 percent. Even telecom services like internet
access are taxed at 18 percent, which is higher than the tax one pays
for a meal in a restaurant. IAMAI wants the GST rates to be
lowered/rationalised for digital services to be at par with offline
counterparts for such services to be more affordable. This will help
popularise these services in rural areas.

Unfair playing field for ecommerce: The onerous burden of Tax Collected
at Source (TCS) imposed on online marketplaces seems to be
step-brotherly treatment to one of the most popular and fast-developing
digital services. TCS forces marketplaces to pay taxes on behalf of
sellers, a responsibility that their offline counterparts do not have to
bear. The fact that ecommerce facilitates inter-state transactions mean
that these platforms have to bear the additional burden of multiple
registrations and filing on behalf of the sellers as well!

The additional problem with TCS is that small-scale sellers whose annual
revenues are lower than the taxable threshold too will have to register
under GSTN and will have 1 percent of their revenues deducted as tax for
every transaction conducted online. This alone is a big disincentive for
small-scale sellers to conduct businesses online. This runs contrary to
the vision of USD1 Tn Digital economy that envisages ecommerce to reach
market size of $150 Billion by 2024.

Book Publishing Startups in the U.S. 2022

Publisher's Weekly

November 18, 2022

Section: FEATURES; Pg. 18; Vol. 269; No. 48

Length: 7480 words

Byline: By Thad McIlroy

Body

Editor's Note: In 2014, Publishers Weekly published an article looking
back on how 30 book publishing startups that had sprung up during the
first years of the digital revolution had fared. Shortly after that ran,
I saw Thad McIlroy's report that featured 600 companies. Eight years
later, PW is happy to team up with Thad to publish his newest report,
which includes more than 1,300 companies. The partnership marks an
expansion of PW's coverage of the innovation that is still occurring in
the book publishing space. -Jim Milliot

This report provides an overview of the English-language book publishing
startup scene in the United States and around the world as of fall 2022.
To the extent that startups capture the innovative spirit of an
industry, this report is about publishing innovation.

There are three audiences for the report: the publishing startups
themselves, service organizations that support the startup community,
and the broad authoring, reading, and publishing communities that follow
publishing startups to get insights into the future of publishing.

At the center of this effort is a spreadsheet of some 1,300 companies,
almost all founded since Amazon launched the Kindle in 2007. The
spreadsheet is a live document, constantly updated, and hosted online by
Publishers Weekly at publishersweekly.com/startups. For the next few
months, readers of the report can access the spreadsheet and perform a
variety of sorts and searches to drill down on the data and extract
insights far beyond what is documented here.

The listings are labeled "book publishing startups." Some readers may
assume that they cover, for example, new book publishing companies or
their imprints. But really they are new ventures looking to help
readers, authors, and, to a lesser extent, publishers themselves find
innovative ways to operate and grow their businesses.

While the majority of these startups (more than 60%) are U.S. based, the
study also reveals a great deal of international publishing industry
innovation.

Some of the categories are unsurprising: self-publishing, e-commerce for
books, subscription services, and fan fiction-but the spreadsheet also
captures activity in audio, comics, crowdfunding, AI, and NFTs.

The report evaluates the sectors supporting the startup universe:
financial, legal, mentoring, and more. It also provides insights into
how the Big Five publishers view startup opportunities, based on
interviews with senior publishing executives, including their mergers
and acquisitions teams.

The importance of intellectual property is discussed, noting the failure
of many startups to embrace and monetize their IP assets.

The "addressable market opportunities" are defined and quantified, based
on available data and estimates.

The spreadsheet contains key financial data on the startups-investments
raised and dollars earned on exits. This data is analyzed in summary
form. The spreadsheet identifies the markets that each startup serves,
at four levels of specificity, and this data is also quantified and
analyzed.

Notable acquisitions are cataloged and trends and opportunities are
identified.

The publication of the report is part of a broader effort by Publishers
Weekly to increase its coverage of startups and publishing innovation.

Introduction

High-profile startups are everywhere, corralling the attention of
entrepreneurs and investors and captivating the public with the energy
and intrigue of startup culture. Think Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak
tinkering in a Los Altos, Calif., garage. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg
dropping out of Harvard. Millions of customers, but no revenue. Billion-
and even trillion-dollar evaluations. It's difficult not to feel the
allure.

Of course, the publishing community has joined the startup party,
attracting innovators and disruptors to this well-established industry.
These entrepreneurs' range of approaches is broad, from author services
to online marketing, from reading clubs to fan communities, with some of
their endeavors extending books into other media, or digital formats
seeking to replace the "bookish object."

As the saying goes: on the internet nobody knows you're a dog. To that
end, it's sometimes hard to tell what's behind the curtain of some of
these web startups. Some are one-person efforts, with a lonely dream of
remaking how books are made, discovered, or sold. Others are
multimillion-dollar companies with hundreds of employees. Success varies
widely. Many of the startups fail in short order, while others have sold
for hundreds of millions of dollars.

What makes each of the more than 1,300 listings in the spreadsheet
particularly valuable is that it includes the following:

A brief mission statement and a description of the type of product or
service provided, classified by category

The amount of declared funding received since founding

Whether the startup is still in business or has merged, been acquired,
or is publicly listed

Just as important, the report also includes summary data that serves to
define the scope of the book startup community, including the parameters
below:

Total funds raised by all startups

Average (and median) funds raised per company

The percentage of startups with declared funding as well as exits via
acquisition, merger, IPO, or having ceased business entirely

This provides a measure of the extent of startup activity within the
larger book publishing industry, and across the broader startup scene in
the United States.

spreadsheet here.

Tracking down publishing startups

I began compiling this list in early 2012 after participating in a panel
at the Tools of Change conference discussing where publishing startups
were headed. At the time, Michael Bashkar had posted online a list of
some 300 companies, covering "writing, publishing, bookselling,
blogging, agency work, and people tangentially related to the industry."
It was a great starting point. In January 2014, I published the first
version of my spreadsheet, including 600 companies. The second edition,
published online in January 2017, featured 900 entries, with much more
data about each company. This third edition catalogs roughly 1,300
startups. (I've omitted 100-plus companies that don't include the U.S.
in their customer focus.) All of the earlier listings have been
rechecked and updated with their current status.

I want to call the list authoritative-I would be surprised if I'm
missing more than a couple dozen smaller companies. But the pace of
startup creation continues, and I continue to track new company
formation.

How do I discover startups? Usually there's an article in one of the
publishing industry magazines or blogs, or, frequently, in a general
interest magazine or newspaper-people never tire of reading insider
stories about the publishing industry ("Company X Seeks to Reinvent Book
Publishing" is a common headline). The article will often suggest a new
category of startups, with NFTs being a recent example. And then my
online searching begins, leading me to startup websites and funding
databases.

At that point, working with a researcher (who has both a library science
degree and an MBA!), I track down the specifics: the company website,
product offerings, money raised, operational status, and so on.

The current status of many of these startups can be fiendishly difficult
to ascertain. All it takes to look like a startup company is a
half-decent website. The company may already be long gone-the founder
forlornly renewing the annual website registration, just in case. And so
we turn also to secondary sources. Most companies sign up for Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social media, and we can find their last
tweet or post. The Internet Archive reveals previous iterations of
company websites. If we can track down the founder/CEO (usually via
LinkedIn) we can ask them for info, but their answers are not always
straightforward. As a matter of policy, I err on the side of assuming a
going concern, rather than prematurely issuing a death certificate to
the startup. I'm always grateful to be able to post corrections to the
online spreadsheet.

Definitions

I define these listings as "book publishing startups." I want to break
down both parts of that equation: book publishing and startup. I'll also
explore how a minority of these startups target book publishing
companies; their markets are more often writers and readers.

Book publishing is often described as a single industry, but it's in
fact far more diverse. I find this broad definition by Bill Kasdorf,
principal at Kasdorf & Associates, to be helpful: trade publishers
publish mainly fiction and nonfiction books, including children's
titles, sold through retail channels. Scholarly publishers publish the
results of research in books and journals provided mainly to libraries,
scholars, and researchers by aggregators and hosting services.
Educational publishers publish content, typically as textbooks augmented
and enhanced by platforms, for teaching in schools, colleges, and
universities. I focused primarily on general trade publishing in
compiling this list.

The children's book side of trade publishing was relatively easy to sort
out: included are those companies that are explicit about rethinking
children's print books and about providing book-like information and
entertainment to children in digital formats.

Scholarly publishing was a challenge, because most of the startups in
that category are providing new tools and services that go beyond book
publishing rather than replacing the existing publishing element. Some
solely target journal publishing, not books (called monographs by many
of these publishers). Only a small number of companies on my list have a
scholarly publishing focus-though there are many other startups in the
space. There is also an ever-increasing number of organizations, mostly
nonprofit, supporting open source publishing. With a few exceptions,
nonprofits are not included in the spreadsheet.

Educational publishing also posed a dilemma. Most of the startups in the
field of education are not intrinsically "publishing startups". Rather
than bringing new types of digital publications to education they are
mostly devoted to moving well beyond the textbook. And so the
educational companies listed here generally have a more traditional view
of educational/textbook publishing.

Startupedness

What is a startup? In theory, of course, it's a new business of any
sort. But I also recognize a kind of existential notion of a startup
versus just a new business (startupedness?). For example, dozens of new
indie bookstores opened in 2022, but they're not included on this list.
Nor are new publishing companies or imprints. Startups tend to see
themselves as a new type of business, with new approaches to existing
challenges. The definition can be loose.

An essential aspect of startups is technology that can scale. Think of
it this way: an editorial services company is hands-on. Each new author
and each new manuscript requires personal care. One editor might tackle
two or three projects at a time, but if more projects arrive then more
editors need to be hired. Meanwhile, a tool like Grammarly can process
several thousand raw manuscripts simultaneously, with roughly the same
number of staff. That's scalability.

I specifically use the example of Grammarly to make another point about
these listings. Grammarly is not included on this list. While the tool
is used by many writers and editors, that's not the primary audience for
the product-it mostly targets students and businesses. And so I left it
out.

On the other hand, Scrivener is included, as it's a tool specifically
targeted to authors (and hence to editors and publishers). Scrivener
illustrates another characteristic of the list. There is no company
called Scrivener-the product, introduced in 2007, is provided by the
U.K. startup Literature and Latte. However, most people seeking
information on Scrivener would simply search "Scrivener" in the
spreadsheet, and so the product name receives an entry here, with a
reference to Literature and Latte as the main listing.

I wasn't sure what to do with the big tech companies-such as Adobe,
Google, Microsoft, and Sony-that have played in the publishing space and
have provided impetus and/or enabling technologies. But they don't fit
beside small independent startups, and so they're not represented here.
On the other hand, Amazon is on the list, because it began as an online
book retailer.

More than 60% of these startups are based in the U.S. The rest are
grouped into two categories of international startups. First there's the
large group (more than 200) from other English countries, mostly
Australia, Canada, and the U.K. Second is the international startups,
which include support for English-language users in the United States,
marketing their offerings beyond their home country. Both India and
China are well represented on this list. (Also included is a small group
of startups targeting Spanish-language readers in the U.S.)

I have used 2007 as the nominal date for inclusion in this report, the
year both the iPhone and the Kindle were introduced, but some of the
companies were founded before that date and are included because they
are former startups that continue to be relevant in their competitive
space.

Audiobooks and podcasts

Audiobooks have been a consistent source of growth for the publishing
industry for the better part of a decade. That growth is flattening, but
it's still up 12.8% in the past year. The last annual report from the
Association of American Publishers clocked audiobook sales at $1.75
billion (versus e-books' $1.97 billion). Amid this, podcasting has
blossomed.

It's easy to categorize audiobook companies as publishing startups, but
what about podcasters? Not so much; few are listed here. Audio as a
broader category is also a fine line-does an audio production company
that, in part, enables audiobook narration count? I think not. And so
I've drawn another (fuzzy) line across this category.

Comics, graphic novels, manga (and anime)

This is another remarkable publishing growth segment-sales of comics and
graphic novels grew by more than 60% in 2021-and another segment with
blurred lines in this report. It's easy to exclude purely print
publishers from a tech-focused listing. But this format is increasingly
digital-and anime, when adapted from manga, seems close enough to
"publishing" to merit its inclusion.

Here's a telling example: the Japanese manga The Prince of Tennis
morphed into an anime series, and then to live action films and TV,
stage musicals, radio programs, and video games. When did it cease being
about "publishing"? I'll consider the media blur further below.

Self-publishing, independent publishing, and hybrid publishing

While self-publishing first came to prominence through the tireless
evangelizing of Dan Poynter (his Self-Publishing Manual was published
back in 1979), the industry didn't really blossom until the Kindle
brought e-books to the masses. While there is no official data
available, self-published book sales now account for billions of dollars
(Amazon's Kindle Unlimited program alone distributes more than $500
million per year in author royalties to independent authors, clearly
representing a multibillion-dollar "department" within Amazon's much
larger e-book sales efforts.)

Self-publishing is now often-and better-categorized as "independent
publishing," but I've stayed with the more familiar term here. It was a
challenge deciding whether each new author service provider should be
included in this listing. There are hundreds. Self-publishing, and
hybrid publishing, described below, are in themselves innovative, but
the companies are mainly copycats of one another, and not particularly
innovative beyond the core model. And so I've listed those organizations
that operate at scale, with more than a couple of employees and a few
dozen authors, and/or include some proprietary technology as part of
their service offering.

Into this mix comes the hybrid publisher. As the name suggests, hybrid
publishers are a cross between self-publishing practitioners and the
traditional publishing model. The hybrid industry has been beset by
controversy, where the worst players most closely resemble the infamous
first vanity press, Vantage Publishing (founded in 1949)-a business
model that could be summed up as "you give us thousands of dollars and
we'll pretend to professionally publish your book." The Independent Book
Publishers Association has been diligent in trying to bring order to
this sector, and now offers Hybrid Publisher Criteria, an unambiguous
set of guidelines for professional hybrid publishing. Only companies
that adhere to that standard are represented here, but again with an eye
to those that have scaled their operations.

Media Convergence

"Today print is merely one way to experience storytelling. Describing
our era as the 'late age of print,' as some have done, expresses the
book's waning influence within a crowded media ecology. Stories now
migrate across different channels, only one of which is books. In
addition, the high degree of media convergence characteristic of today's
marketplace makes it difficult to separate books, audiobooks, and other
media as neatly as we once did. Even the divide between reading a book
and watching a film is less antagonistic than it was for previous
generations. Literature and the mass media are viewed by many as
co-conspirators, not mortal enemies, in today's literary culture." -from
The Untold Story of the Talking Book by Matthew Rubery

As I continue my focus on startups recognizable to someone who works
with bookish authors, I also embrace the truth contained in the
quotation above. While currently most obvious in the comics and graphic
novels space, publishing media is constantly morphing, and the "book
publishing industry" can be seen also as a media industry, a cultural
industry, or an entertainment industry. The implications will continue
to play out against my definitions of book publishing startups.

Important startups that aren't publishing startups

While Kickstarter has raised millions for publishing projects, it wasn't
established with publishing as its core focus. (In Kickstarter's early
messaging, it appealed to "artists, designers, filmmakers, musicians,
journalists, inventors, explorers.") BookTok is currently the hottest
medium for book promotion, but is part of TikTok, "the world's leading
destination for short-form mobile videos." Each of these have more
influence on the publishing industry than many of the startups profiled
here, but, for the sake of rigor, do not appear in the startup listings.

Worth noting also are several multifaceted startups that defy easy
categorization, mainly the e-commerce players that are also author
publishing platforms. Take Amazon: it provides a dedicated hardware
e-reader, e-reading apps, book and e-book retail, and e-book
subscriptions, as well as the leading self-publishing platform-all in
addition to being a publisher itself. These products and services were
launched within Amazon in a manner somewhat akin to startups, but
because they aren't separate companies-all of these programs and
services appear on the Amazon platform-there's just a single listing for
Amazon in the spreadsheet. (Audible has its own entry, as it's still
operated as a standalone company.)

So what about the Nook? Barnes & Noble isn't a startup, and the Nook was
developed internally. I've included it because it would otherwise feel
like an omission. Apple's iBooks (now called Apple Books)-an app, online
bookstore, and an authoring application (discontinued in 2020)-appears
for the same reason.

Investors, lawyers, and advisers

Startups require extensive support in many forms-including financial,
legal, and general business counsel-at all stages of their development,
and I'll be compiling a separate spreadsheet of these "supporters" of
the publishing startup sector.

When researching the investors who have backed publishing startups, few
patterns emerge. Most of them seem to have been drawn to a single pitch
rather than to the publishing sector itself (which some besmirch as a
no-growth industry).

Lawyers who can help publishing startups specialize across the startup
practice area, not within a single sector. Firms like Cooley, Fenwick &
West, and Wilson Sonsini are some prominent examples. There are numerous
individual attorneys serving the publishing community who are not
tightly focused on startups per se.

There are also a cadre of advisers who have coached one or more
publishing startups. We could use more.

Patents and intellectual property

Intellectual property spans trademarks, copyrights, patents, and more.
For startups, much of the value resides in patents. Amazon, Apple, and
Google have a slew of them related to publishing. Most startups do not.
Scribd has a 2014 patent for an "integrated document viewer." Kobo has a
2015 patent for "content-based similarity detection." Storyfit's 2021
patent covers "predictive analytics diagnostic system and results on
market viability and audience metrics for scripted media." Touchpress,
the onetime developer of innovative bookish apps, held a patent-since
abandoned-for an interactive "story development tool." There are no
doubt others.

A 2016 study showed that "patent approvals have a substantial and long
lasting impact on startups: firms whose first patent application is
approved create more jobs, enjoy faster sales growth, innovate more, and
are more likely to go public or be acquired."

Patents are expensive and time-consuming to document and register, and
so startups are remiss when they fail to at least consider trademarks,
which are less onerous to establish. As attorney Lloyd Jassin pointed
out to me in an interview, "having a trademark attached to a startup is
a real asset; it builds goodwill."

I've not uncovered many registered trademarks at the startups studied
here. Jassin suggests that the similarity of the names of several of the
startups indicate that trademark registration may have been overlooked,
and further, that some of these firms could be inviting litigation.

Publishers' approaches to startups

There was a flurry of startup activity when e-commerce became
increasingly dominant in book retail, e-books took hold in the market,
and self-publishing blossomed. Each of the Big Five publishers got their
feet wet in the startup pond-some through internal startup gestation,
others through external investment. Some of the publishers were burned
when their investments went astray.

In preparing this report, I sought insights from within those companies,
and several were generous with their time, in particular if their
remarks could remain anonymous. I felt that understanding how the
companies approach startup innovation was far more important than
putting anyone on the spot.

One executive referenced a frequent and perhaps accurate criticism of
the publishing industry: it is neither agile nor innovative. Publishing
can move at a glacial pace, and publishers are not early adopters.

Another executive observed that there have been bursts of enthusiasm for
startups over the last dozen years, but when an investment didn't work
out, it was perceived as a failure, not as a learning opportunity.
Cynicism follows failure.

Often remarked was that the larger publishers feel that process
innovation should be developed internally, not acquired from an outside
startup. Why pay a premium for a tool that they should be building
in-house? At the same time, a publisher doesn't have to own a startup to
license its technology.

But it's not that these publishers aren't paying attention to what's
going on in the startup community. Each of the large publishers has
executives charged with evaluating acquisitions (though most frequently
of other publishing companies and their backlists).

Clayton Christensen's classic The Innovator's Dilemma: When New
Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail is one of the cornerstones for
understanding the importance of reinvention within established
industries. Christensen studied companies that either collapsed or lost
significant market share through their failure to embrace external
innovation that was essential to their growth. The impact of Amazon on
department stores and book retail is an obvious example.

Do the startups cataloged here threaten to disrupt the existing order of
the publishing industry? Have they already done so? Publisher Ken Whyte,
analyzing the transcripts of the recent Penguin Random House-Simon &
Schuster trial, points to how hard self-publishing has hit PRH's bottom
line: its income from fantasy, mystery, romance, and science fiction
titles fell from $349.2 million to $86.9 million between 2011 and 2019,
"big chunks of which migrated to the self-publishing universe." That's
disruption.

Hybrid publishers attract an increasing number of high-profile public
figures with offers of better royalty splits and greater publishing
control, siphoning off bestsellers that would ordinarily have landed
with the larger trade publishers.

The subscription model, which is kryptonite to trade publishers,
continues to gain ground at Amazon, Scribd, Sweden's Storytel
(internationally), and at a host of smaller startups in this spreadsheet
that are building their businesses on the subscription model.

Are NFTs disruptive? Is AI? The metaverse? Where will the next
disruption come from?

Vulnerabilities

One in five of the startups in this spreadsheet has declared funding;
the companies are mostly bootstrapped. Many of these publishing startups
are not just lean, they're emaciated. In numerous cases there is no
startup, per se-just a website and some good intentions. The marketing
and promotion are scant.

Too many of these startups are trying to fix a problem that doesn't
exist. "Room for innovation" is quite different from "ripe for
disruption." While few of the startups aim to disrupt the entire
publishing business, several make claims to disrupting the editor's
role, the agent's role, or the balance of power between writers and
publishers or publishers and resellers. We shall see.

As Elizabeth Spiers puts it, too many startups "think incumbent
companies are using broken models because they're idiots and not because
the problems are not easily solved." Startups might better seek to
innovate, not re-create.

Book publishing has never been a technology-adept industry, rather it is
historically technology-averse. This is a challenge for the (minority
of) tech-focused startups targeting existing publishing operations.
Selling technology to publishing companies demands lots of costly
hand-holding. Authors, too, are notoriously clumsy around technology,
and there are limits to the complexity of products and services that can
be directed their way. The availability and quality of customer support
becomes a competitive advantage.

Market size

Part of the investor pitch for every startup is the total addressable
market opportunity. The three principal markets these startups target
are publishers, authors, and readers.

I'll focus on some key data for the U.S. market, not the global
opportunity-though many of these startups attract international
customers and revenue. Sizing the U.S. book market leads to various
estimates from varying sources. My interest here is largely trade
publishing.

The Association of American Publishers recorded 2021 sales of $15.4
billion, up 12.2% from 2020. This is based on their reporting
publishers: the association then models the overall industry as roughly
65% larger than their core data, to some $25.4 billion. Total modeled
trade sales were reported at $8.8 billion, up 11.9% from 2020.

NPD reports unit sales of print books at retail (it estimates that its
BookScan captures 85% of trade print sales). Sales were 825.7 million
units in 2021, up from 757.9 million in 2020.

The U.S. Census Bureau reported bookstore sales at $9.03 billion in
2021, essentially flat against 2019 (2020 being an outlier because of
Covid). With most stores also selling ancillary products, books of all
types make up roughly 70% of the reported sales, and textbooks represent
about 40% of book sales. The bureau separately noted that sales for
"book publishers" in 2020 were $25.6 billion (not far off the AAP
model), without detail of the individual publishing sectors.

Bookstat is the go-to source for "below-the-radar" book sales,
estimating that existing industry data misses 37% of e-book and
audiobook sales and 60% of books purchased online ("untracked sales
worth $1.25 billion a year"). The company, recently acquired by Podium
Audio, doesn't release its data to nonsubscribers, so the value is
limited here, other than as a reminder that U.S. book industry sales
data is never canonical.

The pandemic proved to be a boon, sales-wise, for publishing companies,
and while some of the gains have been lost in 2022, sales are generally
higher than they were pre-Covid. But the pandemic has also led to supply
chain problems, which, along with paper shortages, are driving up costs
for publishers everywhere.

How many book publishers are there in the U.S.? If one defines book
publishing broadly-including, for example, associations and governmental
organizations, where publishing is but one activity-the number is in the
tens of thousands. A Book Industry Study Group presentation at BookExpo
2008 estimated that there were 102,634 U.S. publishing entities at that
time (based on active ISBNs), while its 2005 "Under the Radar" report
estimated that there were approximately 63,000 publishers then.

But most analysts suggest a far lower number, closer to around 3,000.
More to the point is the number of publishers that would buy specialized
technology from an outside vendor. I don't know how to pin that down
with any precision, but it's certainly closer to 3,000 than 100,000.

The stats on the global publishing market are spotty, but several
estimates rank U.S. book sales at about 25% of the world total. The
total number of book publishing companies worldwide might follow from
that.

How many authors are active in English-language publishing? The U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics identified 143,200 full-time "writers and
authors" in 2020, but few of those were writers of books. And relatively
few self-published authors rely on writing as their main source of
income. But surely the active author pool must be closer to 500,000 than
150,000. It could be much higher-a million new books are published each
year on Amazon. It's fair to say that most authors recognize that they
need at least some help with editing, publishing, and marketing their
books. But how much are they willing to pay for the assistance? Many of
the startups profiled here are learning answers to that question.

And how many readers are there? In 2021, Pew estimated that 77% of
Americans read at least one book the previous year (Gallup pegs the
number at 83%). While most of those books were not purchased new, that's
still a huge market. Add to that the readers of English-language books
residing in other countries (over a billion people speak English as a
second language), most of whom can be reached online.

Beyond total industry sales figures, there's not a lot of data on how
much consumers actually spend on books. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
estimates that each American spent $92 on "reading" in 2019 (down from
$118 in 2016)-presumably that includes periodicals.

The summary data

Here are a few observations about the summary data collected for this
report. There are more than 40% more listings in 2022 than in the 2017
edition, and many more countries are represented.

The total funds raised by all the startups is more than $3.4 billion,
over three-and-a-half times more than what had been raised five years
ago. (The actual total is larger, but not all of the investments have
been disclosed.) A significant portion of the investment went to a dozen
or so companies-Wattpad garnered $118 million; Inkitt, a competitor, has
raised $80 million; and Scribd now boasts over $100 million in outside
funding. The average investment for all funded companies is $12.9
million. The median is $2.3 million.

If counting just the smaller investments-those at $10 million or
less-some $425 million has been committed (up from $218 million in
2017), an average of just above $2 million per company. The median
investment for those companies is $1.2 million, a 20% increase from
previous reporting. Nearly 21% of companies have received at least some
funding, up from 15% in 2017.

Of the companies listed here, 37% are no longer in business, up from 31%
in 2017. That's an increase, but given that this is a much larger
spreadsheet, it does not indicate a trend line.

Nearly 10% of the companies have managed an exit of some sort, be it via
merger, acquisition, or being listed on a stock exchange (6.1% had
exited in 2017).

There have been four IPOs: Chegg, Digimarc, Wowio, and, of course,
Amazon. Within the past year (to mid-November, 2022), amid a broader
market decline, Digimarc's shares are down by 53% and Amazon's by nearly
50%. Chegg's shares are up slightly. Wowio pivoted out of publishing in
2017 and was delisted in 2018.

Legible came to market in Toronto in December 2021 (and then in
Frankfurt in 2022), via a reverse takeover, at a price of C$1 per share,
reached a high of C$1.40 per share, but as of mid-November is trading
for about C$0.10 per share.

College bookstore operator Barnes & Noble Education was spun out from
Barnes & Noble in 2015, and so doesn't qualify as a startup. It has had
a rocky financial road and trades at 20% of its initial listed share
price.

Where acquisition price data is available, an analysis of the ROI for
investments in companies that went on to be acquired shows a 12.3 times
return on invested dollars.

Notable acquisitions

Last year was by far the most active year for large-scale acquisitions
of publishing startups. Wattpad's purchase by South Korea's Naver in
January 2021 was the biggest earner, at $600 million.

In response, in May 2021, Kakao Entertainment, also from South Korea,
bought online comic app Tapas and serialized fiction app Radish, for
$510 million and $440 million, respectively. By all accounts, Naver and
Kakao are fierce competitors in the international online cartoon,
serialized fiction, and e-book markets; there's nothing like competition
for goosing acquisition target pricing.

In July 2021, Epic, a digital reading platform for kids, was acquired by
India's Byju's, an educational technology company, for $500 million in
cash and stock. (Byju's has recently announced companywide layoffs.)

OverDrive has had the honor of being purchased twice, each time with a
hefty price tag. Acquired first by Rakuten for $410 million in 2015, it
was passed along to KKR for $775 million in 2019. (KKR is one of few
players with multiple publishing-related investments, including Inkling
and RBMedia-not to mention its multibillion-dollar acquisition of
no-longer-dependent-on-legacy-print-media publishing company Axel
Springer.)

Kobo was an early venture-backed success; Rakuten acquired the company
in 2012 for $315 million, providing investors with a 4.5x return on
their investment. The company seemed initially to land as an albatross
at Rakuten (in 2015, Rakuten reported a $68 million impairment charge
for Kobo), but the Japanese e-commerce superstar now reports that Kobo
"is close to profitability."

Latest trends and opportunities

In the past two years, the most successful startup categories have been
serialized/fan fiction reader communities. Wattpad, Inkitt, and Radish
have proven that short serial fiction from mostly young novice writers
works extremely well on mobile devices and can drive huge audiences.
Readers have direct input regarding what gets promoted. Authors are
earning real dollars.

Between comics, graphic novels, and manga, narrative is also becoming
more of a visual medium, driving the success of Tapas and others.

The extraordinary growth of audiobooks and podcasts continues to augur
an industry surrounded by sound. Spotify's $123 million purchase of
Findaway, completed in 2022, reaffirms this.

Children's books startups are always hot, whether the intention is
entertainment or education; the $500 million Epic sale, mentioned above,
being the latest example.

Book clubs and book discovery remain very active sectors. Tertulia
garnered the most press attention this year, although it has dozens of
competitors.

In the past few years, two technologies have become prominent that
appear transformative: AI and blockchain/NFTs. The extent of their
disruptive power isn't yet clear; the startups in these sectors are
still small companies. The usage of AI-generated text (GPT-3) and images
(DALL-E) is exploding-what this will mean to publishing startups is not
yet known. NFT startups Creatokia and Book.io, profiled in Publishers
Weekly in October, are early successes in the blockchain/NFT space,
though our spreadsheet lists more than 30 potential competitors.

Target markets

While updating the spreadsheet for republication, we made a substantial
effort to drill down deeper into the target audiences for these
startups. I had questions about whether the startups saw a greater
opportunity in selling tools to authors or in selling services to
readers. And what types of tools and services provided such
opportunities? I've now got some preliminary insights.

Startups target readers more often than authors, though both are well
served. As anticipated, most startups don't see publishing companies as
the largest market opportunity, but publishers are the focus for about
15% of these ventures.

There are more services on offer than tech-based tools, by a significant
margin. I wonder whether most of the outside investment has gone toward
one more than the other-that's the sort of question one can answer by
sorting through the online spreadsheet.

I broke down the tools and services into some 23 subcategories to better
understand where the startups see their greatest opportunities.

Self-publishing and retail/e-commerce are the largest categories, but
there's substantial focus in other product types, including business
systems, marketing tools, and original content. Some categories appear
more crowded than the total market opportunity might warrant, including
discovery, fan fiction, and blockchain/NFTs.

Conclusions

This is a report about publishing innovation. Startups embody
innovation-if a new idea, grounded in technology, is sufficiently
innovative, it can drive a new business.

It's easy to get caught up in the numbers in the startups spreadsheet:
markets targeted, products offered, and dollars raised. But what's the
larger picture?

After a decade watching book publishing startups, I can attempt to draw
some conclusions.

It's instructive to compare book publishing to other media industries,
specifically music, motion pictures (including film and TV), and gaming.
The first two have essentially eschewed their "physicality"-while one
can still buy CDs, LPs, and DVDs, these are for an ever-decreasing
minority of purchasers. The gaming industry has lagged in full-digital
adoption but is not far behind the others. And consumers increasingly
interact with the content from these industries via subscription
services.

If all books could be accessed by cost-effective Spotify- or
Netflix-style subscriptions, would print sales be damaged? Surely.
Eradicated? Certainly not. As long as print books make up a significant
percentage of overall book sales, the bricks-and-mortar retail and
distribution infrastructure needs to be maintained. That means, at least
in part, retaining the existing industry dynamics. Most readers still
connect with their favorite authors via ink on paper. Invariably this
has an impact on the type of opportunities presented to book publishing
startups, for better and for worse.

Self-publishing is the only part of the trade publishing industry that
is nearly all digital-print makes up only a small percentage of sales
for most independent writers. Not coincidentally, a significant portion
of those sales come from subscription platforms, mostly via Amazon
Kindle Unlimited and Prime Reading, and via Audible for their
audiobooks. (Scribd, meanwhile, had annual revenues of $100 million as
of 2019, a small fraction of Amazon's.)

Self-publishing sales growth has slowed from the heady early days, but
thousands of new authors continue to join the ranks each year. Authors
generally face greater challenges than readers, mostly surrounding
discovery, providing a wide range of opportunities for startups.

There has been a modest decline in reading in the last decade, but the
numbers are still huge. Reading, once a solitary activity, is now
increasingly social, as most recently evidenced by BookTok and a host of
startups here.

If a startup wants to target book publishers, it faces the challenge of
B2B sales and marketing, which generally requires more investment and
infrastructure than B2C.

Additional observations

Alongside tech-sector layoffs, the threat of a recession has dampened
investor enthusiasm in late 2022.

Innovation has its peaks and valleys. Amazon engendered a host of
innovation and then things slowed down. Enhanced e-books and bookish
apps failed to gain traction. The broader publishing industry stalled.
But, since Covid, there's new energy in publishing, and that's reflected
in the startup activity.

As with many publishing companies and bookstores, people invest in
publishing startups because publishing is an industry that they love.
More pragmatically, they understand the dynamics of the industry, and
even if the financial opportunity is modest, they at least understand
the startup's potential and the challenges it might face.

Many book publishing startups are so small that they don't really factor
into the overall picture, other than as an entry in a spreadsheet. Their
chance of raising investment dollars is essentially nil, even smaller
than their market opportunity. There were times when I would look at a
particularly half-hearted effort and think of dear Ebenezer Scrooge: "If
they would rather die, they'd better do it, and decrease the surplus
population."

It's important not to be misled by the failed efforts. The bulk of the
companies in the spreadsheet are viable small businesses. Many have
exited via merger or acquisition. Launching a startup within the book
publishing ecosystem is a viable business endeavor.

But this is a marketplace begging for consolidation. Some offerings,
like discovery and author services, are besieged with players with
little product differentiation.

The real competition

When I think about disruption and opportunity in publishing-related
ventures, I often return to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings's incisive
evocation of his competition: "if you think about your past 30 days, and
analyze the evenings you did not watch Netflix, you can understand how
broad our competition really is. Whether you played video games; surfed
the web; watched a DVD, TVOD, or linear TV; wandered through YouTube;
read a book; streamed Hulu or Amazon; or pirated content (hopefully
not), you can see the market for relaxation time and disposable income
is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea."

In this same vast sea sail the 1,300 book publishing startups analyzed
in this study. Their challenges go far beyond the dynamics of books and
reading, but so too do their opportunities.

I hope this report will stimulate some ideas, some conversation, and
even some new investment. If it can help sharpen a few business plans or
plant a seed for another startup, I'll feel fully rewarded for the
effort.

back on how 30 book publishing startups that had sprung up during the
first years of the digital revolution had fared. Shortly after that ran,
I saw Thad McIlroy's report that featured 600 companies. Eight years
later, PW is happy to team up with Thad to publish his newest report,
which includes more than 1,300 companies. The partnership marks an
expansion of PW's coverage of the innovation that is still occurring in
the book publishing space. -Jim Milliot

This report provides an overview of the English-language book publishing
startup scene in the United States and around the world as of fall 2022.
To the extent that startups capture the innovative spirit of an
industry, this report is about publishing innovation.

There are three audiences for the report: the publishing startups
themselves, service organizations that support the startup community,
and the broad authoring, reading, and publishing communities that follow
publishing startups to get insights into the future of publishing.

At the center of this effort is a spreadsheet of some 1,300 companies,
almost all founded since Amazon launched the Kindle in 2007. The
spreadsheet is a live document, constantly updated, and hosted online by
Publishers Weekly at publishersweekly.com/startups. For the next few
months, readers of the report can access the spreadsheet and perform a
variety of sorts and searches to drill down on the data and extract
insights far beyond what is documented here.

The listings are labeled "book publishing startups." Some readers may
assume that they cover, for example, new book publishing companies or
their imprints. But really they are new ventures looking to help
readers, authors, and, to a lesser extent, publishers themselves find
innovative ways to operate and grow their businesses.

While the majority of these startups (more than 60%) are U.S. based, the
study also reveals a great deal of international publishing industry
innovation.

Some of the categories are unsurprising: self-publishing, e-commerce for
books, subscription services, and fan fiction-but the spreadsheet also
captures activity in audio, comics, crowdfunding, AI, and NFTs.

The report evaluates the sectors supporting the startup universe:
financial, legal, mentoring, and more. It also provides insights into
how the Big Five publishers view startup opportunities, based on
interviews with senior publishing executives, including their mergers
and acquisitions teams.

The importance of intellectual property is discussed, noting the failure
of many startups to embrace and monetize their IP assets.

The "addressable market opportunities" are defined and quantified, based
on available data and estimates.

The spreadsheet contains key financial data on the startups-investments
raised and dollars earned on exits. This data is analyzed in summary
form. The spreadsheet identifies the markets that each startup serves,
at four levels of specificity, and this data is also quantified and
analyzed.

Notable acquisitions are cataloged and trends and opportunities are
identified.

The publication of the report is part of a broader effort by Publishers
Weekly to increase its coverage of startups and publishing innovation.

Introduction

High-profile startups are everywhere, corralling the attention of
entrepreneurs and investors and captivating the public with the energy
and intrigue of startup culture. Think Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak
tinkering in a Los Altos, Calif., garage. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg
dropping out of Harvard. Millions of customers, but no revenue. Billion-
and even trillion-dollar evaluations. It's difficult not to feel the
allure.

Of course, the publishing community has joined the startup party,
attracting innovators and disruptors to this well-established industry.
These entrepreneurs' range of approaches is broad, from author services
to online marketing, from reading clubs to fan communities, with some of
their endeavors extending books into other media, or digital formats
seeking to replace the "bookish object."

As the saying goes: on the internet nobody knows you're a dog. To that
end, it's sometimes hard to tell what's behind the curtain of some of
these web startups. Some are one-person efforts, with a lonely dream of
remaking how books are made, discovered, or sold. Others are
multimillion-dollar companies with hundreds of employees. Success varies
widely. Many of the startups fail in short order, while others have sold
for hundreds of millions of dollars.

What makes each of the more than 1,300 listings in the spreadsheet
particularly valuable is that it includes the following:

A brief mission statement and a description of the type of product or
service provided, classified by category

The amount of declared funding received since founding

Whether the startup is still in business or has merged, been acquired,
or is publicly listed

Just as important, the report also includes summary data that serves to
define the scope of the book startup community, including the parameters
below:

Total funds raised by all startups

Average (and median) funds raised per company

The percentage of startups with declared funding as well as exits via
acquisition, merger, IPO, or having ceased business entirely

This provides a measure of the extent of startup activity within the
larger book publishing industry, and across the broader startup scene in
the United States.

Tracking down publishing startups

I began compiling this list in early 2012 after participating in a panel
at the Tools of Change conference discussing where publishing startups
were headed. At the time, Michael Bashkar had posted online a list of
some 300 companies, covering "writing, publishing, bookselling,
blogging, agency work, and people tangentially related to the industry."
It was a great starting point. In January 2014, I published the first
version of my spreadsheet, including 600 companies. The second edition,
published online in January 2017, featured 900 entries, with much more
data about each company. This third edition catalogs roughly 1,300
startups. (I've omitted 100-plus companies that don't include the U.S.
in their customer focus.) All of the earlier listings have been
rechecked and updated with their current status.

I want to call the list authoritative-I would be surprised if I'm
missing more than a couple dozen smaller companies. But the pace of
startup creation continues, and I continue to track new company
formation.

How do I discover startups? Usually there's an article in one of the
publishing industry magazines or blogs, or, frequently, in a general
interest magazine or newspaper-people never tire of reading insider
stories about the publishing industry ("Company X Seeks to Reinvent Book
Publishing" is a common headline). The article will often suggest a new
category of startups, with NFTs being a recent example. And then my
online searching begins, leading me to startup websites and funding
databases.

At that point, working with a researcher (who has both a library science
degree and an MBA!), I track down the specifics: the company website,
product offerings, money raised, operational status, and so on.

The current status of many of these startups can be fiendishly difficult
to ascertain. All it takes to look like a startup company is a
half-decent website. The company may already be long gone-the founder
forlornly renewing the annual website registration, just in case. And so
we turn also to secondary sources. Most companies sign up for Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social media, and we can find their last
tweet or post. The Internet Archive reveals previous iterations of
company websites. If we can track down the founder/CEO (usually via
LinkedIn) we can ask them for info, but their answers are not always
straightforward. As a matter of policy, I err on the side of assuming a
going concern, rather than prematurely issuing a death certificate to
the startup. I'm always grateful to be able to post corrections to the
online spreadsheet.

Definitions

I define these listings as "book publishing startups." I want to break
down both parts of that equation: book publishing and startup. I'll also
explore how a minority of these startups target book publishing
companies; their markets are more often writers and readers.

Book publishing is often described as a single industry, but it's in
fact far more diverse. I find this broad definition by Bill Kasdorf,
principal at Kasdorf & Associates, to be helpful: trade publishers
publish mainly fiction and nonfiction books, including children's
titles, sold through retail channels. Scholarly publishers publish the
results of research in books and journals provided mainly to libraries,
scholars, and researchers by aggregators and hosting services.
Educational publishers publish content, typically as textbooks augmented
and enhanced by platforms, for teaching in schools, colleges, and
universities. I focused primarily on general trade publishing in
compiling this list.

The children's book side of trade publishing was relatively easy to sort
out: included are those companies that are explicit about rethinking
children's print books and about providing book-like information and
entertainment to children in digital formats.

Scholarly publishing was a challenge, because most of the startups in
that category are providing new tools and services that go beyond book
publishing rather than replacing the existing publishing element. Some
solely target journal publishing, not books (called monographs by many
of these publishers). Only a small number of companies on my list have a
scholarly publishing focus-though there are many other startups in the
space. There is also an ever-increasing number of organizations, mostly
nonprofit, supporting open source publishing. With a few exceptions,
nonprofits are not included in the spreadsheet.

Educational publishing also posed a dilemma. Most of the startups in the
field of education are not intrinsically "publishing startups". Rather
than bringing new types of digital publications to education they are
mostly devoted to moving well beyond the textbook. And so the
educational companies listed here generally have a more traditional view
of educational/textbook publishing.

Startupedness

What is a startup? In theory, of course, it's a new business of any
sort. But I also recognize a kind of existential notion of a startup
versus just a new business (startupedness?). For example, dozens of new
indie bookstores opened in 2022, but they're not included on this list.
Nor are new publishing companies or imprints. Startups tend to see
themselves as a new type of business, with new approaches to existing
challenges. The definition can be loose.

An essential aspect of startups is technology that can scale. Think of
it this way: an editorial services company is hands-on. Each new author
and each new manuscript requires personal care. One editor might tackle
two or three projects at a time, but if more projects arrive then more
editors need to be hired. Meanwhile, a tool like Grammarly can process
several thousand raw manuscripts simultaneously, with roughly the same
number of staff. That's scalability.

I specifically use the example of Grammarly to make another point about
these listings. Grammarly is not included on this list. While the tool
is used by many writers and editors, that's not the primary audience for
the product-it mostly targets students and businesses. And so I left it
out.

On the other hand, Scrivener is included, as it's a tool specifically
targeted to authors (and hence to editors and publishers). Scrivener
illustrates another characteristic of the list. There is no company
called Scrivener-the product, introduced in 2007, is provided by the
U.K. startup Literature and Latte. However, most people seeking
information on Scrivener would simply search "Scrivener" in the
spreadsheet, and so the product name receives an entry here, with a
reference to Literature and Latte as the main listing.

I wasn't sure what to do with the big tech companies-such as Adobe,
Google, Microsoft, and Sony-that have played in the publishing space and
have provided impetus and/or enabling technologies. But they don't fit
beside small independent startups, and so they're not represented here.
On the other hand, Amazon is on the list, because it began as an online
book retailer.

More than 60% of these startups are based in the U.S. The rest are
grouped into two categories of international startups. First there's the
large group (more than 200) from other English countries, mostly
Australia, Canada, and the U.K. Second is the international startups,
which include support for English-language users in the United States,
marketing their offerings beyond their home country. Both India and
China are well represented on this list. (Also included is a small group
of startups targeting Spanish-language readers in the U.S.)

I have used 2007 as the nominal date for inclusion in this report, the
year both the iPhone and the Kindle were introduced, but some of the
companies were founded before that date and are included because they
are former startups that continue to be relevant in their competitive
space.

Audiobooks and podcasts

Audiobooks have been a consistent source of growth for the publishing
industry for the better part of a decade. That growth is flattening, but
it's still up 12.8% in the past year. The last annual report from the
Association of American Publishers clocked audiobook sales at $1.75
billion (versus e-books' $1.97 billion). Amid this, podcasting has
blossomed.

It's easy to categorize audiobook companies as publishing startups, but
what about podcasters? Not so much; few are listed here. Audio as a
broader category is also a fine line-does an audio production company
that, in part, enables audiobook narration count? I think not. And so
I've drawn another (fuzzy) line across this category.

Comics, graphic novels, manga (and anime)

This is another remarkable publishing growth segment-sales of comics and
graphic novels grew by more than 60% in 2021-and another segment with
blurred lines in this report. It's easy to exclude purely print
publishers from a tech-focused listing. But this format is increasingly
digital-and anime, when adapted from manga, seems close enough to
"publishing" to merit its inclusion.

Here's a telling example: the Japanese manga The Prince of Tennis
morphed into an anime series, and then to live action films and TV,
stage musicals, radio programs, and video games. When did it cease being
about "publishing"? I'll consider the media blur further below.

Self-publishing, independent publishing, and hybrid publishing

While self-publishing first came to prominence through the tireless
evangelizing of Dan Poynter (his Self-Publishing Manual was published
back in 1979), the industry didn't really blossom until the Kindle
brought e-books to the masses. While there is no official data
available, self-published book sales now account for billions of dollars
(Amazon's Kindle Unlimited program alone distributes more than $500
million per year in author royalties to independent authors, clearly
representing a multibillion-dollar "department" within Amazon's much
larger e-book sales efforts.)

Self-publishing is now often-and better-categorized as "independent
publishing," but I've stayed with the more familiar term here. It was a
challenge deciding whether each new author service provider should be
included in this listing. There are hundreds. Self-publishing, and
hybrid publishing, described below, are in themselves innovative, but
the companies are mainly copycats of one another, and not particularly
innovative beyond the core model. And so I've listed those organizations
that operate at scale, with more than a couple of employees and a few
dozen authors, and/or include some proprietary technology as part of
their service offering.

Into this mix comes the hybrid publisher. As the name suggests, hybrid
publishers are a cross between self-publishing practitioners and the
traditional publishing model. The hybrid industry has been beset by
controversy, where the worst players most closely resemble the infamous
first vanity press, Vantage Publishing (founded in 1949)-a business
model that could be summed up as "you give us thousands of dollars and
we'll pretend to professionally publish your book." The Independent Book
Publishers Association has been diligent in trying to bring order to
this sector, and now offers Hybrid Publisher Criteria, an unambiguous
set of guidelines for professional hybrid publishing. Only companies
that adhere to that standard are represented here, but again with an eye
to those that have scaled their operations.

Media Convergence

"Today print is merely one way to experience storytelling. Describing
our era as the 'late age of print,' as some have done, expresses the
book's waning influence within a crowded media ecology. Stories now
migrate across different channels, only one of which is books. In
addition, the high degree of media convergence characteristic of today's
marketplace makes it difficult to separate books, audiobooks, and other
media as neatly as we once did. Even the divide between reading a book
and watching a film is less antagonistic than it was for previous
generations. Literature and the mass media are viewed by many as
co-conspirators, not mortal enemies, in today's literary culture." -from
The Untold Story of the Talking Book by Matthew Rubery

As I continue my focus on startups recognizable to someone who works
with bookish authors, I also embrace the truth contained in the
quotation above. While currently most obvious in the comics and graphic
novels space, publishing media is constantly morphing, and the "book
publishing industry" can be seen also as a media industry, a cultural
industry, or an entertainment industry. The implications will continue
to play out against my definitions of book publishing startups.

Important startups that aren't publishing startups

While Kickstarter has raised millions for publishing projects, it wasn't
established with publishing as its core focus. (In Kickstarter's early
messaging, it appealed to "artists, designers, filmmakers, musicians,
journalists, inventors, explorers.") BookTok is currently the hottest
medium for book promotion, but is part of TikTok, "the world's leading
destination for short-form mobile videos." Each of these have more
influence on the publishing industry than many of the startups profiled
here, but, for the sake of rigor, do not appear in the startup listings.

Worth noting also are several multifaceted startups that defy easy
categorization, mainly the e-commerce players that are also author
publishing platforms. Take Amazon: it provides a dedicated hardware
e-reader, e-reading apps, book and e-book retail, and e-book
subscriptions, as well as the leading self-publishing platform-all in
addition to being a publisher itself. These products and services were
launched within Amazon in a manner somewhat akin to startups, but
because they aren't separate companies-all of these programs and
services appear on the Amazon platform-there's just a single listing for
Amazon in the spreadsheet. (Audible has its own entry, as it's still
operated as a standalone company.)

So what about the Nook? Barnes & Noble isn't a startup, and the Nook was
developed internally. I've included it because it would otherwise feel
like an omission. Apple's iBooks (now called Apple Books)-an app, online
bookstore, and an authoring application (discontinued in 2020)-appears
for the same reason.

Investors, lawyers, and advisers

Startups require extensive support in many forms-including financial,
legal, and general business counsel-at all stages of their development,
and I'll be compiling a separate spreadsheet of these "supporters" of
the publishing startup sector.

When researching the investors who have backed publishing startups, few
patterns emerge. Most of them seem to have been drawn to a single pitch
rather than to the publishing sector itself (which some besmirch as a
no-growth industry).

Lawyers who can help publishing startups specialize across the startup
practice area, not within a single sector. Firms like Cooley, Fenwick &
West, and Wilson Sonsini are some prominent examples. There are numerous
individual attorneys serving the publishing community who are not
tightly focused on startups per se.

There are also a cadre of advisers who have coached one or more
publishing startups. We could use more.

Patents and intellectual property

Intellectual property spans trademarks, copyrights, patents, and more.
For startups, much of the value resides in patents. Amazon, Apple, and
Google have a slew of them related to publishing. Most startups do not.
Scribd has a 2014 patent for an "integrated document viewer." Kobo has a
2015 patent for "content-based similarity detection." Storyfit's 2021
patent covers "predictive analytics diagnostic system and results on
market viability and audience metrics for scripted media." Touchpress,
the onetime developer of innovative bookish apps, held a patent-since
abandoned-for an interactive "story development tool." There are no
doubt others.

A 2016 study showed that "patent approvals have a substantial and long
lasting impact on startups: firms whose first patent application is
approved create more jobs, enjoy faster sales growth, innovate more, and
are more likely to go public or be acquired."

Patents are expensive and time-consuming to document and register, and
so startups are remiss when they fail to at least consider trademarks,
which are less onerous to establish. As attorney Lloyd Jassin pointed
out to me in an interview, "having a trademark attached to a startup is
a real asset; it builds goodwill."

I've not uncovered many registered trademarks at the startups studied
here. Jassin suggests that the similarity of the names of several of the
startups indicate that trademark registration may have been overlooked,
and further, that some of these firms could be inviting litigation.

Publishers' approaches to startups

There was a flurry of startup activity when e-commerce became
increasingly dominant in book retail, e-books took hold in the market,
and self-publishing blossomed. Each of the Big Five publishers got their
feet wet in the startup pond-some through internal startup gestation,
others through external investment. Some of the publishers were burned
when their investments went astray.

In preparing this report, I sought insights from within those companies,
and several were generous with their time, in particular if their
remarks could remain anonymous. I felt that understanding how the
companies approach startup innovation was far more important than
putting anyone on the spot.

One executive referenced a frequent and perhaps accurate criticism of
the publishing industry: it is neither agile nor innovative. Publishing
can move at a glacial pace, and publishers are not early adopters.

Another executive observed that there have been bursts of enthusiasm for
startups over the last dozen years, but when an investment didn't work
out, it was perceived as a failure, not as a learning opportunity.
Cynicism follows failure.

Often remarked was that the larger publishers feel that process
innovation should be developed internally, not acquired from an outside
startup. Why pay a premium for a tool that they should be building
in-house? At the same time, a publisher doesn't have to own a startup to
license its technology.

But it's not that these publishers aren't paying attention to what's
going on in the startup community. Each of the large publishers has
executives charged with evaluating acquisitions (though most frequently
of other publishing companies and their backlists).

Clayton Christensen's classic The Innovator's Dilemma: When New
Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail is one of the cornerstones for
understanding the importance of reinvention within established
industries. Christensen studied companies that either collapsed or lost
significant market share through their failure to embrace external
innovation that was essential to their growth. The impact of Amazon on
department stores and book retail is an obvious example.

Do the startups cataloged here threaten to disrupt the existing order of
the publishing industry? Have they already done so? Publisher Ken Whyte,
analyzing the transcripts of the recent Penguin Random House-Simon &
Schuster trial, points to how hard self-publishing has hit PRH's bottom
line: its income from fantasy, mystery, romance, and science fiction
titles fell from $349.2 million to $86.9 million between 2011 and 2019,
"big chunks of which migrated to the self-publishing universe." That's
disruption.

Hybrid publishers attract an increasing number of high-profile public
figures with offers of better royalty splits and greater publishing
control, siphoning off bestsellers that would ordinarily have landed
with the larger trade publishers.

The subscription model, which is kryptonite to trade publishers,
continues to gain ground at Amazon, Scribd, Sweden's Storytel
(internationally), and at a host of smaller startups in this spreadsheet
that are building their businesses on the subscription model.

Are NFTs disruptive? Is AI? The metaverse? Where will the next
disruption come from?

Vulnerabilities

One in five of the startups in this spreadsheet has declared funding;
the companies are mostly bootstrapped. Many of these publishing startups
are not just lean, they're emaciated. In numerous cases there is no
startup, per se-just a website and some good intentions. The marketing
and promotion are scant.

Too many of these startups are trying to fix a problem that doesn't
exist. "Room for innovation" is quite different from "ripe for
disruption." While few of the startups aim to disrupt the entire
publishing business, several make claims to disrupting the editor's
role, the agent's role, or the balance of power between writers and
publishers or publishers and resellers. We shall see.

As Elizabeth Spiers puts it, too many startups "think incumbent
companies are using broken models because they're idiots and not because
the problems are not easily solved." Startups might better seek to
innovate, not re-create.

Book publishing has never been a technology-adept industry, rather it is
historically technology-averse. This is a challenge for the (minority
of) tech-focused startups targeting existing publishing operations.
Selling technology to publishing companies demands lots of costly
hand-holding. Authors, too, are notoriously clumsy around technology,
and there are limits to the complexity of products and services that can
be directed their way. The availability and quality of customer support
becomes a competitive advantage.

Market size

Part of the investor pitch for every startup is the total addressable
market opportunity. The three principal markets these startups target
are publishers, authors, and readers.

I'll focus on some key data for the U.S. market, not the global
opportunity-though many of these startups attract international
customers and revenue. Sizing the U.S. book market leads to various
estimates from varying sources. My interest here is largely trade
publishing.

The Association of American Publishers recorded 2021 sales of $15.4
billion, up 12.2% from 2020. This is based on their reporting
publishers: the association then models the overall industry as roughly
65% larger than their core data, to some $25.4 billion. Total modeled
trade sales were reported at $8.8 billion, up 11.9% from 2020.

NPD reports unit sales of print books at retail (it estimates that its
BookScan captures 85% of trade print sales). Sales were 825.7 million
units in 2021, up from 757.9 million in 2020.

The U.S. Census Bureau reported bookstore sales at $9.03 billion in
2021, essentially flat against 2019 (2020 being an outlier because of
Covid). With most stores also selling ancillary products, books of all
types make up roughly 70% of the reported sales, and textbooks represent
about 40% of book sales. The bureau separately noted that sales for
"book publishers" in 2020 were $25.6 billion (not far off the AAP
model), without detail of the individual publishing sectors.

Bookstat is the go-to source for "below-the-radar" book sales,
estimating that existing industry data misses 37% of e-book and
audiobook sales and 60% of books purchased online ("untracked sales
worth $1.25 billion a year"). The company, recently acquired by Podium
Audio, doesn't release its data to nonsubscribers, so the value is
limited here, other than as a reminder that U.S. book industry sales
data is never canonical.

The pandemic proved to be a boon, sales-wise, for publishing companies,
and while some of the gains have been lost in 2022, sales are generally
higher than they were pre-Covid. But the pandemic has also led to supply
chain problems, which, along with paper shortages, are driving up costs
for publishers everywhere.

How many book publishers are there in the U.S.? If one defines book
publishing broadly-including, for example, associations and governmental
organizations, where publishing is but one activity-the number is in the
tens of thousands. A Book Industry Study Group presentation at BookExpo
2008 estimated that there were 102,634 U.S. publishing entities at that
time (based on active ISBNs), while its 2005 "Under the Radar" report
estimated that there were approximately 63,000 publishers then.

But most analysts suggest a far lower number, closer to around 3,000.
More to the point is the number of publishers that would buy specialized
technology from an outside vendor. I don't know how to pin that down
with any precision, but it's certainly closer to 3,000 than 100,000.

The stats on the global publishing market are spotty, but several
estimates rank U.S. book sales at about 25% of the world total. The
total number of book publishing companies worldwide might follow from
that.

How many authors are active in English-language publishing? The U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics identified 143,200 full-time "writers and
authors" in 2020, but few of those were writers of books. And relatively
few self-published authors rely on writing as their main source of
income. But surely the active author pool must be closer to 500,000 than
150,000. It could be much higher-a million new books are published each
year on Amazon. It's fair to say that most authors recognize that they
need at least some help with editing, publishing, and marketing their
books. But how much are they willing to pay for the assistance? Many of
the startups profiled here are learning answers to that question.

And how many readers are there? In 2021, Pew estimated that 77% of
Americans read at least one book the previous year (Gallup pegs the
number at 83%). While most of those books were not purchased new, that's
still a huge market. Add to that the readers of English-language books
residing in other countries (over a billion people speak English as a
second language), most of whom can be reached online.

Beyond total industry sales figures, there's not a lot of data on how
much consumers actually spend on books. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
estimates that each American spent $92 on "reading" in 2019 (down from
$118 in 2016)-presumably that includes periodicals.

The summary data

Here are a few observations about the summary data collected for this
report. There are more than 40% more listings in 2022 than in the 2017
edition, and many more countries are represented.

The total funds raised by all the startups is more than $3.4 billion,
over three-and-a-half times more than what had been raised five years
ago. (The actual total is larger, but not all of the investments have
been disclosed.) A significant portion of the investment went to a dozen
or so companies-Wattpad garnered $118 million; Inkitt, a competitor, has
raised $80 million; and Scribd now boasts over $100 million in outside
funding. The average investment for all funded companies is $12.9
million. The median is $2.3 million.

If counting just the smaller investments-those at $10 million or
less-some $425 million has been committed (up from $218 million in
2017), an average of just above $2 million per company. The median
investment for those companies is $1.2 million, a 20% increase from
previous reporting. Nearly 21% of companies have received at least some
funding, up from 15% in 2017.

Of the companies listed here, 37% are no longer in business, up from 31%
in 2017. That's an increase, but given that this is a much larger
spreadsheet, it does not indicate a trend line.

Nearly 10% of the companies have managed an exit of some sort, be it via
merger, acquisition, or being listed on a stock exchange (6.1% had
exited in 2017).

There have been four IPOs: Chegg, Digimarc, Wowio, and, of course,
Amazon. Within the past year (to mid-November, 2022), amid a broader
market decline, Digimarc's shares are down by 53% and Amazon's by nearly
50%. Chegg's shares are up slightly. Wowio pivoted out of publishing in
2017 and was delisted in 2018.

Legible came to market in Toronto in December 2021 (and then in
Frankfurt in 2022), via a reverse takeover, at a price of C$1 per share,
reached a high of C$1.40 per share, but as of mid-November is trading
for about C$0.10 per share.

College bookstore operator Barnes & Noble Education was spun out from
Barnes & Noble in 2015, and so doesn't qualify as a startup. It has had
a rocky financial road and trades at 20% of its initial listed share
price.

Where acquisition price data is available, an analysis of the ROI for
investments in companies that went on to be acquired shows a 12.3 times
return on invested dollars.

Notable acquisitions

Last year was by far the most active year for large-scale acquisitions
of publishing startups. Wattpad's purchase by South Korea's Naver in
January 2021 was the biggest earner, at $600 million.

In response, in May 2021, Kakao Entertainment, also from South Korea,
bought online comic app Tapas and serialized fiction app Radish, for
$510 million and $440 million, respectively. By all accounts, Naver and
Kakao are fierce competitors in the international online cartoon,
serialized fiction, and e-book markets; there's nothing like competition
for goosing acquisition target pricing.

In July 2021, Epic, a digital reading platform for kids, was acquired by
India's Byju's, an educational technology company, for $500 million in
cash and stock. (Byju's has recently announced companywide layoffs.)

OverDrive has had the honor of being purchased twice, each time with a
hefty price tag. Acquired first by Rakuten for $410 million in 2015, it
was passed along to KKR for $775 million in 2019. (KKR is one of few
players with multiple publishing-related investments, including Inkling
and RBMedia-not to mention its multibillion-dollar acquisition of
no-longer-dependent-on-legacy-print-media publishing company Axel
Springer.)

Kobo was an early venture-backed success; Rakuten acquired the company
in 2012 for $315 million, providing investors with a 4.5x return on
their investment. The company seemed initially to land as an albatross
at Rakuten (in 2015, Rakuten reported a $68 million impairment charge
for Kobo), but the Japanese e-commerce superstar now reports that Kobo
"is close to profitability."

Latest trends and opportunities

In the past two years, the most successful startup categories have been
serialized/fan fiction reader communities. Wattpad, Inkitt, and Radish
have proven that short serial fiction from mostly young novice writers
works extremely well on mobile devices and can drive huge audiences.
Readers have direct input regarding what gets promoted. Authors are
earning real dollars.

Between comics, graphic novels, and manga, narrative is also becoming
more of a visual medium, driving the success of Tapas and others.

The extraordinary growth of audiobooks and podcasts continues to augur
an industry surrounded by sound. Spotify's $123 million purchase of
Findaway, completed in 2022, reaffirms this.

Children's books startups are always hot, whether the intention is
entertainment or education; the $500 million Epic sale, mentioned above,
being the latest example.

Book clubs and book discovery remain very active sectors. Tertulia
garnered the most press attention this year, although it has dozens of
competitors.

In the past few years, two technologies have become prominent that
appear transformative: AI and blockchain/NFTs. The extent of their
disruptive power isn't yet clear; the startups in these sectors are
still small companies. The usage of AI-generated text (GPT-3) and images
(DALL-E) is exploding-what this will mean to publishing startups is not
yet known. NFT startups Creatokia and Book.io, profiled in Publishers
Weekly in October, are early successes in the blockchain/NFT space,
though our spreadsheet lists more than 30 potential competitors.

Target markets

While updating the spreadsheet for republication, we made a substantial
effort to drill down deeper into the target audiences for these
startups. I had questions about whether the startups saw a greater
opportunity in selling tools to authors or in selling services to
readers. And what types of tools and services provided such
opportunities? I've now got some preliminary insights.

Startups target readers more often than authors, though both are well
served. As anticipated, most startups don't see publishing companies as
the largest market opportunity, but publishers are the focus for about
15% of these ventures.

There are more services on offer than tech-based tools, by a significant
margin. I wonder whether most of the outside investment has gone toward
one more than the other-that's the sort of question one can answer by
sorting through the online spreadsheet.

I broke down the tools and services into some 23 subcategories to better
understand where the startups see their greatest opportunities.

Self-publishing and retail/e-commerce are the largest categories, but
there's substantial focus in other product types, including business
systems, marketing tools, and original content. Some categories appear
more crowded than the total market opportunity might warrant, including
discovery, fan fiction, and blockchain/NFTs.

Conclusions

This is a report about publishing innovation. Startups embody
innovation-if a new idea, grounded in technology, is sufficiently
innovative, it can drive a new business.

It's easy to get caught up in the numbers in the startups spreadsheet:
markets targeted, products offered, and dollars raised. But what's the
larger picture?

After a decade watching book publishing startups, I can attempt to draw
some conclusions.

It's instructive to compare book publishing to other media industries,
specifically music, motion pictures (including film and TV), and gaming.
The first two have essentially eschewed their "physicality"-while one
can still buy CDs, LPs, and DVDs, these are for an ever-decreasing
minority of purchasers. The gaming industry has lagged in full-digital
adoption but is not far behind the others. And consumers increasingly
interact with the content from these industries via subscription
services.

If all books could be accessed by cost-effective Spotify- or
Netflix-style subscriptions, would print sales be damaged? Surely.
Eradicated? Certainly not. As long as print books make up a significant
percentage of overall book sales, the bricks-and-mortar retail and
distribution infrastructure needs to be maintained. That means, at least
in part, retaining the existing industry dynamics. Most readers still
connect with their favorite authors via ink on paper. Invariably this
has an impact on the type of opportunities presented to book publishing
startups, for better and for worse.

Self-publishing is the only part of the trade publishing industry that
is nearly all digital-print makes up only a small percentage of sales
for most independent writers. Not coincidentally, a significant portion
of those sales come from subscription platforms, mostly via Amazon
Kindle Unlimited and Prime Reading, and via Audible for their
audiobooks. (Scribd, meanwhile, had annual revenues of $100 million as
of 2019, a small fraction of Amazon's.)

Self-publishing sales growth has slowed from the heady early days, but
thousands of new authors continue to join the ranks each year. Authors
generally face greater challenges than readers, mostly surrounding
discovery, providing a wide range of opportunities for startups.

There has been a modest decline in reading in the last decade, but the
numbers are still huge. Reading, once a solitary activity, is now
increasingly social, as most recently evidenced by BookTok and a host of
startups here.

If a startup wants to target book publishers, it faces the challenge of
B2B sales and marketing, which generally requires more investment and
infrastructure than B2C.

Additional observations

Alongside tech-sector layoffs, the threat of a recession has dampened
investor enthusiasm in late 2022.

Innovation has its peaks and valleys. Amazon engendered a host of
innovation and then things slowed down. Enhanced e-books and bookish
apps failed to gain traction. The broader publishing industry stalled.
But, since Covid, there's new energy in publishing, and that's reflected
in the startup activity.

As with many publishing companies and bookstores, people invest in
publishing startups because publishing is an industry that they love.
More pragmatically, they understand the dynamics of the industry, and
even if the financial opportunity is modest, they at least understand
the startup's potential and the challenges it might face.

Many book publishing startups are so small that they don't really factor
into the overall picture, other than as an entry in a spreadsheet. Their
chance of raising investment dollars is essentially nil, even smaller
than their market opportunity. There were times when I would look at a
particularly half-hearted effort and think of dear Ebenezer Scrooge: "If
they would rather die, they'd better do it, and decrease the surplus
population."

It's important not to be misled by the failed efforts. The bulk of the
companies in the spreadsheet are viable small businesses. Many have
exited via merger or acquisition. Launching a startup within the book
publishing ecosystem is a viable business endeavor.

But this is a marketplace begging for consolidation. Some offerings,
like discovery and author services, are besieged with players with
little product differentiation.

The real competition

When I think about disruption and opportunity in publishing-related
ventures, I often return to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings's incisive
evocation of his competition: "if you think about your past 30 days, and
analyze the evenings you did not watch Netflix, you can understand how
broad our competition really is. Whether you played video games; surfed
the web; watched a DVD, TVOD, or linear TV; wandered through YouTube;
read a book; streamed Hulu or Amazon; or pirated content (hopefully
not), you can see the market for relaxation time and disposable income
is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea."

In this same vast sea sail the 1,300 book publishing startups analyzed
in this study. Their challenges go far beyond the dynamics of books and
reading, but so too do their opportunities.

I hope this report will stimulate some ideas, some conversation, and
even some new investment. If it can help sharpen a few business plans or
plant a seed for another startup, I'll feel fully rewarded for the
effort.

AND STRATEGIES FOR STARTUPS IN PAKISTAN

I. INTRODUCTION

This paper is aimed at exploring factors that drive the creation and the
subsequent expansion of small and young firms. Knowledge spillover and
urbanization in conjunction with entrepreneurship, particularly firm
entry and consequent expansion of small and young firms, is key to job
creation, innovation and productivity improvement. An understanding of
how to enhance creation and expansion of small and young firms can be
helpful for entrepreneurs, policy makers and the academic community.
Entrepreneurship remains an under-researched area in the field of urban
economics (Glaeser, Rosenthal and Strange, 2010). This may partially be
attributed to the dynamic nature of the entrepreneurship phenomenon. The
knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (KSTE) argues that the
ability of knowledge intensive environments to foster new ideas can
create entrepreneurial opportunities and their commercialization,
leading to urban success (Audretsch, Belitski and Korosteleva, 2019).

Urban environments are particularly conducive to entrepreneurial
activities, innovation and growth because of agglomeration economies
(Jacobs 1969). Different competencies and nancial resources are more
accessible in cities, allowing for denser information flows and market
proximity (Acs et al. 2009). Hence, literature finds a two-way
relationship between cities and knowledge-driven entrepreneurship. While
urbanization has vast potential for social and economic development, the
urbanization process also poses serious challenges (Glaeser 2012). Some
of these challenges include traffic congestion, higher crime rates,
pressure on urban services, and the spread of disease. The twenty first
century will witness the movement of 5 billion people into cities-more
than half of which will be in Asia. So, it becomes important to
investigate how cities can support or hinder entrepreneurship.

The growth rate of employment creation by small and young firms is
higher as compared to large corporations (Decker et al. 2015).
Identification of factors that influence creation and expansion of small
and young firms can be useful for employment generation and improving
the quality of life in urban centers (Glaeser. et al. 2010, Backman and
Loof, 2015). Building on Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship
(Acs et al. 2009, Audretsch and Keilbach, 2007, Audretsch and Lehmann
2005), this paper attempts to contribute to the discourse on
entrepreneurship through qualitative insights by analyzing perspectives
of entrepreneurs about the role of various sources of knowledge
spillover and constraints being faced by them.

This paper specifically attempts to analyze the entrepreneurial process
of young firms (3 to 5 years) in the information technology (IT)sector
of the two largest cities of Pakistan, namely Karachi and Lahore. It
also sheds light on the strategies that may help startups in scale up
and how cities can promote entrepreneurship.

The remaining study is organized as follows: Section II presents a
literature review; Section III outlines the research design employed for
the study; Section IV discusses the key characteristics of focus groups
and select cities; Section V describes the findings and analysis of
focus groups; and Section VI concludes.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW

Traditionally, research and theory in entrepreneurship were built using
quantitative analysis, which may sometimes not capture the real-world
interplay of knowledge spillover and other related issues relevant to
entrepreneurship. Considering the role of tacit knowledge, quantitative
data has limitations and forges aggregation biases in capturing
knowledge spillover. Suddaby, Bruton, and Si (2015) explain that while
the quantitative approach has helped in accumulating knowledge, it also
undermines many subjective and reflexive aspects in the theoretical
process leading to missing elements within the endogenous
entrepreneurship theory. Peters and Waterman (1982), for example, have
inspired research that fills this gap by compiling an account of
successful American corporations.

Their study was based on extensive interactions with different levels of
management and front desk employees of various corporations. The study
found how customer care, autonomy of front-desk officials, and eagerness
for experimentation led to success of those companies. The unique
individualistic narratives of success of those corporations could not
have been captured in quantitative data or financial indices. Simpeh
(2011) has compiled an outline of different dimensions of
entrepreneurship theories including sociological and psychological
aspects among others, which highlights the need for qualitative and
interdisciplinary research in entrepreneurship.

Compared to developed countries, governments and firms in developing
countries do not invest much in knowledge creation. Property rights are
also not very strong in the latter. In this context, the incentives and
factors affecting entrepreneurship may be different in the developing
world. Leff (1979) explains that a key function of entrepreneurship in
developing countries is to mobilize factors such as capital and skilled
labor which might otherwise not be supplied or allocated to the
activities where their highest productivity is unleashed. In this
context, the necessity of well-functioning markets to facilitate the
entrepreneurial process has been recognized in many countries, and
governments have worked substantially on improving markets and removing
barriers to entrepreneurship and other market failures. It is
imperative, however, that urban policy be designed to ensure that
positive externalities (knowledge, network and demonstration) flourish
and assist in the growth of entrepreneurship.

Young incumbent firms grow more rapidly and undertake risks that often
lead to more innovation (Wadho, Goedhuys and Chaudhry, 2019). Thus, it
becomes important to understand the perspectives of entrepreneurs
running small and young firms. There has been relatively little focus in
research on qualitative techniques to understand entrepreneurship;
insights through such techniques can bring forward important
perspectives and many aspects which remain hidden through a country or
city level analysis of quantitative data. Williams, Shahid and Martinez
(2016) surveyed 300 informal enterprises in Lahore and shared how the
motivations for informality display heterogeneity and instead of
compliance cost, informality is driven by the nature of entrepreneurs
and enterprises. Considering a sizeable informal economy in Pakistan,
this was an important finding as this result counters the traditional
view that the informal economy is a direct result of high regulatory
compliance costs.

The initial years of a startup or business firm are important to raise
investment and gain customers. A study conducted by the World Bank has
found “the early stage capital gap”, in which entrepreneurs highlighted
the challenges posed by limited financing due to a lack of venture
funding. The same study has also reported: “the stakeholders interviewed
for this study unanimously highlighted the unfriendliness of the current
policy and regulatory environment” (World Bank, 2019).

However, the study mainly analyses such regulatory barriers in the case
of investors and venture funds. There was also no discussion on urban
policy and governance issues that directly affect startups and IT firms
in any city. The current study attempts to further unravel the
influences of urban policies and governance on starting and expanding a
firm.

There is substantive literature on drivers of entrepreneurship in
Pakistan that highlights the importance of research and development
expenditures, and government stability (Rasool, Gulzar and Naseer,
2012). Sector, city and cluster level studies provide important insights
about entrepreneurship, innovation and expansion of firms (e.g. for
textile sector innovation: Wadho and Chaudhary, 2016). Many city level
dynamics are active in Pakistan such as presence of skilled and creative
workforce, education level and urbanization trends (Iftikhar, Ahmad and
Audretsch, 2020). Agglomeration and urbanization also play an important
role; firms prefer to start their operations where there is
concentration of similar or diverse firms. This may be helpful for firms
to gain from knowledge spillovers and business-to-business (B2B)
contracts (Haroon and Chaudhary, 2014). Personal perspectives of
entrepreneurs can lead to a deeper understanding of the dynamics
associated with entrepreneurship.

Nishat and Nadeem (2016) have found that personal contact with
successful entrepreneurs reduces the risk of failure among potential
entrepreneurs. However, the study had limitations as it only pointed out
that direct contact reduces the fear of failure but could not explain
whether such personal contacts could lead to knowledge spillover from
incumbent entrepreneur to potential entrepreneurs.

A strand of literature also explores entrepreneurial intentions and
entrepreneurial education (Ahmed, Chnadran and Klobas, 2017). Pakistan
has witnessed a rise of public and private national incubation centers
recently. It is important to understand perspectives of entrepreneurs
about how they have gained knowledge and mentoring from such programs by
university based and other entrepreneurial education programs. Such
incubation centers may also help in developing social capital of
entrepreneurs. Social capital has been found to be an important
contributor of entrepreneurial success (Khan, 2020).

Haque (2007) examined entrepreneurship in Pakistan and used focus groups
with businessmen to collect their perspectives about the challenges they
face. The study found that many of the businesses in Pakistan lack
innovation and are being operated as inherited property. The businessmen
also shared constraints such as unfavorable legal framework, corruption,
lack of financing and unfriendly city management. The focus groups were
conducted in four cities of Punjab and participants were selected from
various industries without any constraint with regards to the age of the
firm in question. The current study differs in two ways; one, it is
concerned with young firms and two, it considers specifically the IT
sector.

There is not much literature in Pakistan that attempts to understand the
motivations of entrepreneurs, especially in the IT sector. There is an
understanding that entrepreneurial intentions play an important role in
the entrepreneurial journey. However, the motivations that trigger
someone to pursue entrepreneurship remains a scarcely explored dimension
in the literature. Similarly, there is room to further investigate the
formal and informal sources of knowledge for Pakistani entrepreneurs.
Secondly, urban policy and governance have not gained traction as
important contributors to varying performance of entrepreneurs across
different cities of Pakistan. Third, there is a high rate of failure
amongst IT startups in Pakistan and in general; this warrants an
exploration into why some small firms and startups perform better than
others.

Existing literature revolves around regulatory constraints, but we
rarely come across discussion on management practices, which can be
helpful at an early stage of a firm. What are the motivations, personal
perspectives and experiences of entrepreneurs? What are the city level
dynamics that might explain their success or failure? Insight to such
questions can contribute to the scholarship on entrepreneurship and may
inform public policy.

III. RESEARCH DESIGN

The key research question is: What drives firm creation and expansion in
major cities of Pakistan? Focus group interviews for this study were
conducted with IT sector entrepreneurs, based in the two largest cities
of Pakistan namely Karachi and Lahore. The IT sector was selected due
its emerging presence in Pakistan. There has been much debate in
academic as well as policy circles about the rise of this sector as well
its domestic growth and export potential. However, there have been many
cases of failure; moreover, many IT startups opt to leave Pakistan and
set up shop in other countries in search of favorable and promising
business environments. Lahore and Karachi are the main hubs of IT
activity. These cities are selected due to the ease in identifying IT
sector firms and due to a stronger presence of IT sector entrepreneurs.
Respondents were chosen through Pakistan Software Houses Association
(P@SHA).

Such organizations play the role of gatekeeper in research regarding
identification of respondents for interviews and FGDs. Focus groups are
effective in understanding collective perspectives of participants
through discussions on motivations, priorities, experiences, and
reflexivity. FGDs were chosen as the method of information in this study
as they help to gain an understanding of perspectives through
interaction amongst similar participants which may not be obtained
through individual interviews. FGDs have the advantage that they allow
participants to explore and clarify ideas with each other, which
provides checks and balances on various perceptions and opinions. They
allow for an in-depth exploration of cultural norms, attitudes and
opinions, and help bring out shared values. The participants influence
each other through their ideas and experiences and the moderation also
helps to stimulate conversation required on key questions (Freitas,
Oliveira, Jenkins and Popjoy, 1998).

The key advantage of FGDs is the interaction amongst participants of
focus groups and the role of the moderator. Literature also discusses
pros and cons of the level of engagement of the moderator e.g. active or
passive. Morgan (1996) explains three essential components of focus
groups: (1) its purpose i.e. data collection (2) interaction amongst the
group as a source of data, and (3) the researcher's active role in
facilitating the group discussion. He also highlights other additional
dimensions and forms of focus groups, but the three components measured
above hold a key position in this regard. The process of focus groups
was conducted in four phases: (a) planning for participant selection and
elaboration of key questions, (b) organizing and conducting focus group
sessions, (c) transcription of sessions, and (d) analysis.

Semi-structured focus groups were conducted in order to explore
perspectives of entrepreneurs beyond a priori expectations. A priori
codes have been identified in the Appendix. A few broad questions and
probes for focus groups are described below.

How (and where) do entrepreneurs acquire ideas and knowledge about
starting and growing a business?

Discussion in the focus group started with this broad question and was
followed by supplementary questions: Did you come up with the idea about
the business and firm creation while working in another organization?
Did anyone help you identify a business idea and then expand it? Have
you ever registered or reviewed a patent document relating to your
business concern? Was there any research by any other organization
(public or private) that you found helpful? What kind of support did you
get from family members, friends, colleagues and employees for starting
a business and then learning new ideas to expand the business?

The aforementioned and following questions were posed to the
participants since the purpose was to shed light on research regarding
the role and sources of knowledge required to start a business.

What are the key factors and practices that helped in the survival and
growth of the businesses/startups?

Many businesses fail in their initial years. If you have succeeded, what
about your approach made you successful? What are some of the managerial
or business practices which have helped you? Where did you learn those
practices and ideas? Should the government focus more on research for
your business area or should it strive to fulfill infrastructure
requirements such as energy and roads among others?

What is the role of urban policies and design on firm performance?

Why have you set up your business in this city? What are the advantages
and disadvantages of doing business in this city? How effective is this
city in inspiring business ideas and how has it facilitated you in
finding resources to work on your business ideas? Have you ever
considered shifting your business to another city? Why or why not?

The replies of the entrepreneurs to this particular question were useful
in explaining whether urbanization and city dynamics play a moderating
role for knowledge spillovers.

What urban policy changes can be conducive for business?

Should this city focus more on urban transport or housing? How do these
issues affect your businesses? What do you think about internet
facilities in this city? Are there enough places and forums where
businessmen meet with each other and professionals to discuss business
issues? How can the city government enhance learning opportunities which
will be helpful to you and to your employees?

This question was posed to the participants in order to understand their
perspectives regarding key policy changes required to promote
entrepreneurship.

IV. KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF FOCUS GROUPS AND THE TWO CITIES

Three focus group interviews were conducted in each city in year 2018.
6-12 entrepreneurs participated in each group and a total of 55
entrepreneurs were interviewed in this process. Each focus group
interview lasted for 60 minutes. Owners of domestic small and medium
enterprises in the IT sector were invited to participate. As a token of
appreciation, a small gift was given to participants and they were
apprised in advance, through invitation letters, about this study,
expectations of the researcher, and potential benefit for entrepreneurs
in the form of collective learning. Members of the focus groups were
selected based on the criterion that they have a small business that has
survived for at least three to five years. The approval for research
with human subjects was obtained from the University of Delaware 1.

Table 1 shows similarities and contrasts between the socio-economic
profiles of the two cities.

It may not be possible to generalize the findings of focus groups in
this study due to limited representation. However, a few important
dimensions of outcomes of focus groups may contribute to the analysis in
five ways. First, focus groups provide contextual and personal
narratives about entrepreneurial activity. Second, they capture the
collective perspective about sources of knowledge including urban design
and policies. Third, most entrepreneurship studies focus on constraints
to entrepreneurship, however little is known about how small businesses
grow and survive. This aspect has been discussed in focus groups and
effort has been made to identify the defining factors for growth of
small business following Peters and Waterman(1982) who highlighted
successful business practices in US firms. Fifth, the literature
identifies tacit sources of entrepreneurial knowledge in agglomeration
economies which have been explored through focus groups.

Chen, Zou, and Wang (2009) have also highlighted how soft skills and
networks nurture growth in small ventures. So the findings of this paper
may be helpful for academics, policymakers and entrepreneurs.

V. FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS OF FOCUS GROUPS

This section discusses the data obtained through six focus groups, 3
each in Lahore and Karachi. These two cities are the most populated and
industrialized cities of Pakistan. They are under different provincial
jurisdictions and are the pioneering grounds for IT based
entrepreneurship in the country. The same set of questions was posed to
all focus groups in both cities. This section is divided into four
subsections based on the four primary questions and topics discussed in
the focus groups. Names of entrepreneurs are not mentioned in the
analysis and each entrepreneur was given a code. Entrepreneurs occupied
numbered seats for the focus group discussions. The first letter denotes
city (L for Lahore and K for Karachi), the first digit represents the
sequence of the focus groups (there were 3 groups in each city), and the
last digit represents the seat number that an entrepreneur occupied
during the focus group discussion.

Thus, if an entrepreneur participated in the second focus group in
Lahore and was sitting on the fourth seat, he/she was assigned the
identifier L.2.4. If an entrepreneur in Karachi participated in the
third focus group and was sitting on the seventh seat, he/she was
assigned the identifier K.3.7.

IDEAS, KNOWLEDGE AND INSPIRATION TO START A BUSINESS

This section explores perspectives and insights into how (and where)
entrepreneurs acquire ideas and knowledge about starting a business and
the operational and decision-making process of starting a business.
Literature reports that educational achievements and patents may be
considered as sources of knowledge for starting a business. Discussion
in the focus groups, however, revealed that patents may not hold much
significance as a source of knowledge. Similarly, there was no mention
of the role that research and development by the public or private
sector might play in encouraging startups. However, they reported other
sources of knowledge and ideas that contributed to their process of
starting a business.

In contrast to the a priori codes, most entrepreneurs narrated how their
business idea was inspired by a problem or issue in their surroundings.
They confronted a problem either by themselves, with people around them
or during an interaction in the market. A scholar may call it a gap in
the market that entrepreneurs identify. However, entrepreneurs
considered it as a problem to be solved through their business ideas. An
entrepreneur (K.3.9) who started an e-commerce platform for trading
fabrics described, “The basic problem in the online business of fabrics
was customer frustration”. His response to this problem took the shape
of firm creation as he decided to resolve this issue in the market.
Another entrepreneur (K.3.2) who established an online platform for
matching businesses and freelancing workers said, “The idea generated
when I outsourced my own work to somebody”.

He encountered a problem in dealing with his supplier and it motivated
him to address this issue by matching clients and outsourcing industry
according to their mutual requirements. Similarly, an entrepreneur
(K.3.3.) said, “Ideas are derived from needs. When an entrepreneur finds
that there is a need for a product or service in their surroundings,
he/she starts working on it”.

Many entrepreneurs reported a similar personal experience of observing a
problem and then trying to solve it. An entrepreneur (K.3.4.) who is
involved in banking and financial solutions said:

“I think ideas are based on experiences that you gain through travel and
meeting people. Ideas arise when one comes up with alternate means of
performing a task. Ideas usually come from experiences. They may arise
when you work with someone, they may arise when you go out with the kids
at the shopping mall or the park. You find ideas from what is happening
around you.”

The above statement highlights the importance of confronting a problem
or challenge and a subsequent response to addressing the problem in
question. However, it also shows the spillovers of working in other
organizations or setups as people get ideas from their jobs and then try
to exploit them by forming their own businesses. This aspect also
appeared as a consistent theme in all focus groups. An entrepreneur
(L.2.5.) said, “My previous job enabled me to acquire the right skill
set which geared me up to start a business and groomed me to confront
the challenges that I faced when running the business”. An entrepreneur
(L.3.2.) shared that when he decided to start the business, he talked to
his ex-employer and proposed a B2B relationship. Thus, it shows that
existing work and job experience feeds the potential entrepreneur.

But it is clear from the analysis of the focus group data that there is
indeed diversity in motivation, reasons, and ideas to start a business.
An entrepreneur (L.2.2), for example, said that he entered into business
immediately after graduation and the motivation was that he wanted to
venture into something different.

As mentioned earlier, problem solving was a consistent theme. An
entrepreneur (L.2.3) shared that he came up with the idea to improve
Kidney Dialysis Machines after his Aunt and Uncle died. He shared:

“I watched my Aunt and Uncle suffer many diseases due to unsafe kidney
dialysis machines in Pakistan. That is when I realized patients in
Pakistan requiring dialysis were exposed to health risks due to poor
quality of kidney dialysis machines. I observed that there were no
alternatives. I was working in a similar industry in the US and knew
that the technology used in dialysis machines in the US was decades
ahead of the obsolete and cheap technology Pakistan was relying on.
After my Aunt and Uncle died, I moved back to Pakistan and decided to
develop technology to introduce state of the art dialysis machines in
Pakistan at an affordable price for a developing country.”

Thus, in this particular case, confronting the problem was not enough
and there was still a need for knowledge stock and ideas which came from
his work experience in the US. Many entrepreneurs also said that they
look around the world especially the US market and observe the latest
occurrences and activities there. Then they try to replicate or build on
the same idea. However, this may only be true for sectors like IT and it
may have limited generalizability to other sectors. An entrepreneur
(L.1.7) said that her nephew's blindness led her to develop new gadgets
for the blind. After observing the problem, she confronted it by
discussing it with people with special needs to gauge their requirements
and design solutions for them. This shows that the entrepreneur in this
case was sensitive to what was happening around her and it led her to
set a business to provide entertainment and learning opportunities to
blind children.

Given that IT is one of the most knowledge-intensive sectors, it was
expected that the entrepreneurs would be drawing knowledge from
research-oriented initiatives and universities, however, this only
applied to a few cases. An entrepreneur (L.2.5.) said: “LUMS (Lahore
University of Management Sciences) taught us business development and
many of the lessons and insights I gained during those classes have
proven to be of core value in running my business”. One of the
entrepreneurs (L.3.2.) shared that they found research papers of a
professor from Washington DC who was working on the same idea that they
wanted to commercialize. They approached the professor with a request to
explain the paper in detail as they had difficulty in understanding it.
In this case they found the relevant work but had to resort to
interaction for a deeper understanding.

Similarly, an entrepreneur (L.2.5.) who was working on virtual reality
said that at some stage he was stuck and could not find a solution to
the problem he was confronting. He then approached his former teacher
who informed him about a paper by a Stanford professor. That paper
indeed helped the entrepreneur to develop his idea further. This
highlights the process of knowledge spillover. It is important to
understand that in this case a personal connection played an important
role in helping the entrepreneur reach the required information and
knowledge. Thus, human to human interactions are essential for knowledge
spillover. It is widely understood that uncodified knowledge is
transferred through personal connections. In this case, even codified
knowledge was transferred through both personal and digital connections.

A few entrepreneurs also acknowledge the role played by friends. An
entrepreneur (L.3.5.) said, “I think the fact that we started this
initiative with friends is an important aspect behind the success of our
business. Moreover, support from family is common for startups
especially at the early stage.” Pakistani society is structured around
families and personal connections, which carry weight for starting a
business. A study by Qidwai et al. (2017) pointed out that “…in a joint
family, the family has been more dependent on the decision-making powers
of the elderly members of the family as compared to the ones who are
living separate from their parents and almost all the areas of their
lives have been contributed to by them”. Many entrepreneurs reported
that they discussed ideas with friends and family members to refine them
and to get new knowledge.

Regarding the process of starting a business, only a few complained
about hurdles in the business registration process. Starting a business
is considered an important indicator in World Bank's Ease of Doing
Business Report and governments have been focusing on reforms in this
area. But its impact on entrepreneurship is debatable. One entrepreneur
(K.2.1.) opined, “The barrier to entry is very weak in Pakistan”. Some
entrepreneurs however did talk about other regulatory problems
(discussed later) but it was clear that once they have an idea, they
observe their surroundings and try to test it before starting a
business. Some of them discussed with peers and colleagues while others
focused on market research. This finding was in line with the Austrian
school of economics which postulates that entrepreneurs learn from
interactions with the market.

An entrepreneur (K.2.2.) who started a portal for e-books said: “We
conducted market research to gauge the demand for an e-book portal. It
was very useful since we came across a couple of good opportunities.
Eventually we pitched the idea to some investors and were successful.”

One entrepreneur (L.3.2.) got the idea to turn his hobby into a
business. He was a motorcyclist in California and decided to start a
motorcycle business in Pakistan. These diverse perspectives were
interesting as they showed that it is not possible to generalize the
sources of knowledge or the process of starting a business. The
diversity in experiences of entrepreneurs makes a strong case for
qualitative research in entrepreneurship. Another entrepreneur (K.1.4.)
started a business because he felt that he could not utilize his
creativity fully at his previous job.

A survey conducted by the Social Innovation Lab (SIL) in 2018 reports
the following results based on responses by 200 startups from sixteen
cities of Pakistan:

Figure 1 corroborates the results of the focus groups conducted in this
study. It shows the popularity of the various reasons or motivating
factors that inspired entrepreneurs to start their businesses. A
majority of entrepreneurs reported “desire to solve a problem” as their
motivation to establish a startup. However, the second most common
motivation is the entrepreneur striking “an innovative idea”. If we
combine categories of “an innovative idea” and “academic training in
startups”, it reaches 29% in the above pie chart.

Thus personal interactions, previous jobs, and personal motivations play
a role in driving entrepreneurship. However, the dominant theme in these
focus groups was that in Pakistan many entrepreneurs recognized a
problem and tried to provide the solution. Many people may come across
the same dilemma but may not think of starting a business to solve it.
An entrepreneur when confronting the same problem would create a
business solution. This points to an important dimension of
entrepreneurship which is the unique personality of the entrepreneur.
This also highlights the importance of understanding behavioral aspects
of decision-making by entrepreneurs and what makes them different. This
is beyond the scope of this study, but some experimentation and research
can enhance the body of knowledge further.

KEY FACTORS AND PRACTICES FOR FIRM SURVIVAL AND GROWTH

The endogenous growth theory highlights the role of knowledge spillovers
among incumbent firms that lead to the expansion of firms and ultimately
enhance economic growth in a society. This section explores answers to
the questions: What helps businesses in expanding and flourishing? What
are the key factors and practices which support firms in growing during
initial years of their establishment?

Other than a priori code, an emerging theme in the discussion was
centered on client/customer care or need. Many entrepreneurs reported
that the key to their survival and growth can largely be attributed to
client care. An entrepreneur (K1.1.) said; “In my opinion the most
important factor is the value you give to the customer”. Another
entrepreneur (K.3.8.) said: “Keep a good relationship with them
(clients)”. Hence the entrepreneurs discussed various aspects of dealing
with and managing clients in order to survive and succeed in the
business. An entrepreneur (K.1.1.) highlighted that working with large
businesses really helps young firms. He said, “If you are working with
an established brand and providing quality services within a given time,
it multiplies your business”. It seems like a good strategic choice and
it points to the diversity of factors that shape the growth of a firm.

After client-related practices, the second most discussed factor for the
survival and growth of a business was patience and persistence.
Entrepreneurs shared stories of the hard times they faced during the
initial years of business. They expressed how patience and commitment
proved vital for their survival. An entrepreneur (K.2.4.) opined: “The
passion needed to run a business is what helped us survive”. Failure
also played an important role as learning key lessons helped
entrepreneurs make better decisions in subsequent ventures.

The third most discussed factor was financial management. Many
entrepreneurs mentioned that prudence in spending was a major factor in
survival and growth. Some entrepreneurs said that they did not have any
finances when they started commercializing their ideas. The fact that
they had to raise everything from scratch taught them valuable lessons
in financial planning and this proved to be a crucial ingredient for
their success. An entrepreneur (K.2.1.) said: “We focused on
strategically minimizing costs and this proved to be a highly beneficial
approach. Better financial management helped in the long term”. However,
it is difficult to ascertain whether too much focus on prudence is a
good practice. Sometimes it may lead to avoiding essential expenses on
human resources, research as well as marketing. Thus, a
one-size-fits-all financial management practice is not good for
businesses and the best financial management practice is often figured
out while in operation.

A few participants considered that a good team is vital for business
survival and growth. An entrepreneur (K1.2.) said: “In hard times, the
most important support comes from your team and not from finances”. An
entrepreneur (L.2.5.) said: “The team factor is vital for business
development”. It may be interpreted that the teams are not only good for
implementing ideas but may contribute to new ideas as well. This is an
area that needs further exploration.

Some entrepreneurs mentioned that support of family members is a crucial
element behind their success during hard times. On the other hand, some
expressed their exasperation over excessive and unwelcome intervention
from their family, as many Pakistanis continue to live with their
parents during their adulthood, a lifestyle which is also prevalent in
the rest of Asia to some extent. Such influences of family systems on
economic progress and political mobility have been researched. Alesina
and Giuliano (2014) found that “strong family ties may interfere with
activities leading to faster growth, but they may provide relief from
stress, support to family members and increased wellbeing.” However, one
of the entrepreneurs (K.3.5.) said; “It is indeed a dual edge. On one
hand, joint families put pressure on you to avoid failures and on the
other hand they support you in case you fall.” However, personal network
was considered a key factor in business survival and growth.

Members of the younger generation may take over the family business and
introduce latest management and operational techniques; however, such
innovation in the family business is not always appreciated by the
family elders. An entrepreneur (K.3.1.) said:

“I brought the family business towards technological innovation and have
transformed it into a more innovative business solution; we reshaped the
process to reach the end customer instead of sharing profits with
retailers and middlemen. At first, I faced resistance from my family,
but insisted on running the business according to modern and
contemporary business strategies. It worked out well in the end”.

However, another entrepreneur (K.3.5) had different views and he said:
“Family supports you, yes. But friends and family do not help much.
Frankly speaking, they disturb you a lot as well”. Thus, opinions
regarding the role of family and friends vary across entrepreneurs, but
most entrepreneurs considered family support a positive factor in the
survival and growth of their businesses. An entrepreneur (L.3.2.)
specifically mentioned the dominant role played by a friend who helped
him grow his business.

In terms of sources of ideas, an entrepreneur (K.3.9.) reported that he
watched movies to understand coding and business ideas. He said: “I
watched the movie Social Network (a movie about coding on Facebook), and
decided to do something along these lines. Then I started coding and a
year and a half later, I established my startup”. An entrepreneur
(L.2.5.) said: “We watched movies/seasons and Steve Jobs' interviews to
improve business development”. Thus, it is important to know that
research and development in the form of research papers and patents are
not the only sources of knowledge that entrepreneurs draw on. They
extensively explore various other sources of information and ideas to
start and grow their businesses. Only a few entrepreneurs mentioned it
as a source of ideas and knowledge, but it does point to the role of
such avenues for ideas. Robert Shiller, the Nobel Prize Winner in
Economics, emphasized the role of narratives to change the course of
development in a society (Shiller, 2017).

However, there may be many people who have watched such movies but did
not aspire to become entrepreneurs. Thus, the uniqueness of being an
entrepreneur is reiterated through this finding. An entrepreneur
(L.2.2.) said: “We do business with clients in the US and most of our
ideas come from that market”. This again points to the diversity in
sources of knowledge spillovers for entrepreneurs in developing
economies.

An entrepreneur (L.1.1.) emphasized that there is a need to synchronize
your ideas with client needs. He said: “If our services, ideas and end
customers are on the same page, business will grow. There are three
recipes for disaster when running a business: 1) running out of cash, 2)
undesirable products and services, and 3) time consuming business
processes.” An entrepreneur (L.2.5.) was of the view that “A businessman
should have good planning and startup investment”. In terms of knowledge
spillovers, an entrepreneur (L.2.3.) mentioned: “Mentorship and hired
consultants are helpful in gaining new ideas and knowledge when planning
to expand a business”. Similarly, an entrepreneur (L.2.1.) said: “I meet
CEOs of various companies for techniques, ideas, and learning how to
attract customers”. An entrepreneur (L.2.4.) while discussing business
growth said: “In my field, core technical knowledge gained from my
engineering education and relevant work experience helped me”.

Thus, knowledge spillovers do play a role in the growth of a firm but
almost nobody mentioned the role of any government research or any such
project that may have served to create new knowledge relating to their
business.

IMPACT OF URBAN QUALITY AND CITY DYNAMICS

The focus groups were held in the two largest and most industrialized
cities of Pakistan. They host majority of the IT companies and startups
operating in the country. However, both cities fall under separate
provincial jurisdiction and differ significantly in terms of city
dynamics. So, while there were many similarities, some contrasts also
emerged in the data obtained through focus groups. The role and dynamics
of each city were discussed with regards to promoting entrepreneurship.

Most entrepreneurs shared that they started the business in a particular
city because they were already living there. This is in line with the
argument presented by Glaeser (2011), who holds the opinion that
entrepreneurs first choose where to live and then decide where to
establish their business. An entrepreneur (K.2.3.) said: “I was born and
raised in Karachi. That was a major factor that kept me on track…In the
business of e-distribution, all our connections are based in Karachi”.
An entrepreneur (K.2.4.) shared “I was brought up in Karachi and started
the business at a very early age. Karachi seems to be the hub of all
kinds of products.”

Many entrepreneurs reported that they preferred a particular city
because they had strong family and professional connections there which
were helpful at the early stage of their business. However, an
entrepreneur (K.3.5.) said that if he had to move his business, he would
move to Lahore or Islamabad because, “these cities have a stronger
community of entrepreneurs”. It highlights the role of connections and
bonding among like-minded professionals that help them start and grow a
business. An entrepreneur (K.2.3.) said; “The support system of the
family was of much benefit in everything from recruitment to office
space to opening up a bank account. This is the advantage of being in
your home ground”. Another entrepreneur (L.2.4) shared his story of the
resistance he faced from his family when venturing into
entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurs discussed that they preferred cities like Karachi and
Lahore because they had higher literacy levels and a large market. An
entrepreneur (L.1.6.) started a marketing business in Lahore because he
thought a higher literacy level was essential for such a business to be
popular. He said, “Our startups depend on the education levels of
people. The more aware and enlightened they are, the more we sell”.
Similarly, an entrepreneur (L.1.2.) said: “People choose Lahore to start
their business because of higher education and awareness levels in
Lahore as compared to other cities. The marketing cost is low in Lahore
because of educated people in this city”. Education levels affect both
the supply and demand side of entrepreneurship. Moreover, many
entrepreneurs pointed to relatively better access to internet and
broadband services in these cities. This finding shows that urban
quality (including access to infrastructure such as broadband services)
contributes to higher entrepreneurship.

Although Karachi has the largest share in the GDP of Pakistan and is
also the most industrialized city, entrepreneurs shared that Lahore
seemed more conducive to startups and early stage IT companies.
Entrepreneurs attributed this to the proactive role of the provincial
government of Punjab in Lahore as compared to provincial Government of
Sindh operating in Karachi. The federally administered legal and
regulatory arrangements are the same in both cities, but the
sub-national policies have a strong impact on the entrepreneurial
environment. An entrepreneur (L.1.5) said: “The establishment of an IT
park called Arfa Kareem Tower and a government-run incubator inside this
park has helped Lahore promote startups”. However, an entrepreneur
(K.2.5.) from Karachi said: “I appreciate Karachi for its mature
business environment especially in the IT sector. The market in Karachi
is diverse and extensive, making it suitable for business”.

It seemed that there was some bias in considering the other city better
than theirs. However, there is still a lack of research on in-depth
comparison between these cities to make a conclusive argument. An
entrepreneur (K.3.6) for example said: “Government support is much
better in Lahore as compared to Karachi. Sindh Government is not doing a
lot for entrepreneurs”.

The focus groups revealed that more participants in Lahore had moved to
the city from other smaller cities. The entrepreneurs talked about
talented professionals who were based in other cities but ended up
working in Lahore. This was not the case in Karachi. Most entrepreneurs
were born in Karachi and were hiring staff only from Karachi. This is in
line with Pakistan's recent Census 2017 according to which Lahore has
grown by 116% in population from 1998-2017 while Karachi has grown by
60% during the same period. An entrepreneur (L.1.1.) said: “I belong to
Sialkot, a small city and could not find appropriate staff and
opportunities there and thus decided to shift to Lahore”. Similarly, an
entrepreneur (L.1.3.) said: “I am from Mandi Baha Uddin and pursued my
education from Lahore”. There were not many entrepreneurs in Karachi who
had migrated from other cities as compared to Lahore where many
entrepreneurs had moved from smaller cities and rural areas.

There is a lack of concrete evidence, but it appears that more talent is
now moving more towards Lahore than Karachi. Further research is needed
to substantiate this claim. It is an important area for enhancing
further understanding about the entrepreneurship process. As pointed out
by Hamguchi and Kondo (2016), turn-over of knowledge is more significant
for entrepreneurship and innovation as compared to knowledge stock.
Turn-over in their study was referred to as the movement of
knowledge/talented workers to and from a city. An entrepreneur (K.3.3.)
shared: “Punjab Government's incubation center in Lahore has made an
impact on the entrepreneurship culture and has promoted startups.

However, I personally feel that Karachi is a multicultural society and
suffers less from social ills such as class segmentation as compared to
the rest of Pakistan, and also offers a huge market. That is the
strength of Karachi.” However, in terms of governance, the public
transport system may have made a difference. Lahore started a public bus
transit system which was appreciated by many entrepreneurs who
participated in the focus groups. No such system exists in Karachi.
Entrepreneurs pointed to the lack of a public transit system in Karachi
which makes it difficult for workers to commute smoothly. In this case
entrepreneurs preferred to hire workers who lived closer to their office
which restricts their choice to recruit workers from a diverse pool. An
entrepreneur (K.1.5.) said: “General infrastructure as well as property
is too expensive. If an employer wants to hire someone who lives far
away from the business site, it becomes an issue.

Karachi is a huge city, so if one wants to find the best talent it is a
challenge because the natural preference is to hire only those who live
nearby due to transport constraints. By doing so the talent aspect is
constantly undermined. So efficient and safe public transport systems
will allow men and women to work freely anywhere in Karachi”. This is an
important point to appreciate the role of public transport in promoting
entrepreneurship and facilitating knowledge spillovers.

In terms of constraints and regulatory barriers, entrepreneurs pointed
towards the negative role played by the informal economy. Entrepreneurs
working in the formal sector comply with all taxation and regulatory
requirements while informal businesses substantially reduce costs by
avoiding taxes and other regulatory compliances. This type of situation
in any sector makes it difficult for formal entrepreneurs to compete
with informal businesses. An entrepreneur (K.3.4.) said: “As far as
weaknesses are concerned, there is an issue of the lack of proper
documentation of all businesses operating in the city which leads to the
growth of the informal economy”. It was also pointed out in the focus
groups that Karachi had faced a law and order situation in the past
which has contributed to relatively suboptimal performance of
entrepreneurs.

An entrepreneur (K.3.5.) said: “The worst aspect of Karachi is its law
and order situation”, while another (K.3.10.) shared: “The situation of
security is much better in Lahore and Islamabad as compared to Karachi.
It explains why there are more startups in those cities…I think it
impacts your thinking power…You would go to the safest place”.

An interesting contrast became evident during the discussions. Karachi
hosts big corporate conglomerates which are considered to create an
unfavorable environment for startups and entrepreneurs. This situation
is partially analogous to the comparison between Pittsburg and New York
carried out by Chinitz (1961). He points to large agglomerates in
Pittsburg which were not conducive to small entrepreneurs as compared to
the culture of diverse and relatively small enterprises based in New
York. Karachi also has the presence of a huge number of small and medium
enterprises, but the presence of large corporate agglomerates has
probably made a difference as they generally prefer to do business with
more established firms instead of young companies and startups. However,
entrepreneurs expressed that one positive aspect of Karachi is the
presence of banks and financial institutions; one entrepreneur (K.3.8.)
said: “We work with financial insurance companies.

All banks are operating from here…Similarly headquarters of major
insurance companies are based in Karachi. It is an added advantage as we
do not have to travel to other cities.” Similarly, an entrepreneur
(K.1.1.) said: “The advantage of doing business in Karachi is that B2B
relationships can start easily”. On the other hand, an entrepreneur
(K.1.3.) believed: “Karachi is a highly saturated and very competitive
market”. Hence profit margins are also thin in the city. Contrary to
this perspective, another entrepreneur (K2.3.) said: “Operating cost is
cheaper in Karachi”. Thus, population density, as pointed out by Glaeser
(2012) poses both negative and positive externalities for economic
activity. Effective urban policies and governance can help a city to
maximize positive externalities and minimize negative externalities.

PERSPECTIVES ON POTENTIAL URBAN AND PUBLIC POLICY REFORMS

This section discusses the ideas and proposal public policies in
promoting or hindering entrepreneurship. It was not astonishing that
most entrepreneurs highlighted the role of tax policies and their
enforcement as the biggest constraint to the entrepreneurial process.
Many entrepreneurs mentioned that the presence of multiple tax regimes
and agencies hinder business growth. Pakistan has recently allowed
provincial governments to collect General Sales Tax (GST) on services.
Earlier the federal government used to collect GST on services on behalf
of the provinces. But recently provinces established their own revenue
collection authorities. Provincial revenue authorities are now proactive
in terms of collecting taxes. Most entrepreneurs said the duplication
between federal and provincial taxes really hurt them. An entrepreneur
(L.1.6.) said: “Tax policies should be reviewed overall in Pakistan”.

Startups also mentioned that the recent move of the federal government
to exempt startups from income tax for three years was a healthy
development. Regarding regulatory barriers an entrepreneur (K.2.3.)
shared an interesting observation:

“I think when your business is small, regulatory barriers do not hurt
it. In fact, it works to your advantage. You have sole proprietorship;
the bank manager will facilitate you in opening the account and
obtaining checkbooks. EOBI (Employees Old Age Benefits Institute)
persons will not give you any trouble, but as the business grows, these
regulations will create difficulties. Generally, middle-size businesses
face more problems. Both the large corporations and small businesses do
not worry much about regulations. The system works in their favor or
they can turn it to their advantage. But medium size businesses usually
get trapped. Public sector officials are bribed by large corporations
while small businesses are usually not on their radars. The moment a
business starts growing, regulatory officials come to impose all sorts
of barriers. Thus, there is an inherent bias against medium size
businesses in Pakistan”.

This is an important finding regarding how young and growing firms face
more challenges as compared to large corporations. While small firms
remain informal and avoid all sorts of levies, corporations are powerful
enough to manipulate the system. Similarly, a few entrepreneurs said
that the government should support new businesses to compete with
established corporations. Participant (L.2.2.) said that a public-sector
organization in Punjab working in the IT sector directly competes with
many small entrepreneurs during the process of public procurement which
has hurt small and young private businesses in the city. He further
said: “The Government needs to stay away from running businesses itself.
It should help industry and universities through financing research
initiatives”.

An entrepreneur (K.2.3.) appreciated the federal government for
establishing National Incubation Centers (NICs) in large cities and
suggested: “The government should establish a growth fund with some good
Venture Capital Firms”. There has been a rising trend in Pakistan to
invest in property speculation which has squeezed investment for
entrepreneurs and other productive sectors of the economy. In this
regard, an entrepreneur (K.3.3.) said: “The biggest problem in Karachi
is that one can purchase a piece of land worth Pakistan Rupees (PKR) 10
million and it would sell for PKR 10.2 million after six months. Under
such circumstances why would people with savings invest in innovative
ideas of young entrepreneurs?”

An entrepreneur (K.2.4.) mentioned the weak enforcement of property
rights and an inefficient judicial system as the biggest constraints in
the growth of IT companies and startups. He said: “I think the judicial
system is highly flawed in Pakistan. If you face any dispute, it goes
nowhere for a very long period. We faced a lot of problems regarding
such issues. Even if you get a decision of a commercial dispute in your
favor, it takes years and years to recover the amount. We went through
painful experiences of this nature.”

Another entrepreneur (L.2.4.) said: “Infrastructure is very important
for a healthy business environment”. An entrepreneur (K.1.3.)
highlighted the parking problem in Karachi and opined that it is a major
loophole in the urban architecture given that a public transit system is
non-existent, and everyone has to use their personal vehicles for
commuting. Ride sharing services have partially contributed to
overcoming this problem.

An entrepreneur (L.2.5.) suggested: “The Punjab Government should make
the province a freelancing hub for the IT sector's development”.
However, such policies should be carefully designed as many initiatives
of the sort turn out to be unsuccessful in fostering the true essence of
entrepreneurship. In some cases, many startups are launched but only
survive during the incubation phase. One of the entrepreneurs (K.3.2.)
highlighted the need to revisit the curriculum in order to produce more
entrepreneurs and said: “The role of curriculum is crucial in promoting
entrepreneurial spirit amongst the young. When we went to school and
university, we did not know that entrepreneurship was a career option.
Including inspiring stories from the corporate world into the national
curriculum may promote entrepreneurship in the young generation”.

However, an entrepreneur (K.3.4.) mentioned an interesting initiative by
one of the leading business schools in Karachi: “They invite CEOs for
mentorship and have even designed courses that are meant to be taught
exclusively by CEOs”. An entrepreneur (K.3.9.) said: “Our education
system is not working. We pay PKR 80,000 fees for children, but they end
up studying like horses and donkeys. Our society only cares about
getting degrees and overlooks the value of genuine education. My own
parents did not want me to become an entrepreneur.” The popular view in
Pakistan is that children should pursue a good education just so that
they can secure a good job.

An entrepreneur (K.1.3.) especially highlighted the constraints he faced
in importing a particular hardware for his startup. The same
entrepreneur also said; “The charges for getting our payments from other
countries through banking channels, against our services/products, are
very high in Pakistan.” Many entrepreneurs expressed constraints they
face in receiving and sending payments abroad due to a number of foreign
exchange controls imposed by the State Bank of Pakistan. It has led to
higher costs and delays in business transactions. Entrepreneurs further
informed that due to the lack of reliable and efficient payment methods
and gateways like PayPal, many IT companies have shifted their offices
to UAE and Singapore.

Table 2 presents a summary of key findings of the FGDs. The summary is
presented in terms of the same four categories discussed in this
section.

VI. CONCLUSION

The research on entrepreneurship and knowledge spillovers has dominantly
been quantitative in nature. The Knowledge Spillover Theory of
Entrepreneurship stipulates that potential entrepreneurs decide to start
a business when they come across unexploited knowledge. However, the
above analysis reveals that the starting point for most of the
businesses was an encounter with a problem or an issue that exists in
the surrounding of a potential entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs highlighted
the importance of knowledge spillover but this step came after the
decision to start a business.

The discussion also highlights the channels of knowledge spillover such
as family connections, association with teachers and mentors, work
experience in other companies and abroad, and hiring of consultants.
Entrepreneurs reported their learning from business relations with
either established domestic brands or international clients. Some
entrepreneurs also passionately searched for ideas and knowledge from
research on Silicon Valley. The discussion has also added to the body of
knowledge through sharing the first-hand experiences of entrepreneurs in
expanding their businesses. Client/customer care was described as the
most important management practice that helps a business expand.
Similarly, meticulous financial management and patience were considered
the most important qualities of entrepreneurs that help them foster
business growth. Entrepreneurs learn such practices from various
personal interactions and experiences which indicates the role of
knowledge spillovers in the process of firm expansion.

As hypothesized in this article, entrepreneurs shared that the overall
quality of urban policy and a city's ability to attract talent are
important considerations for an entrepreneur. Karachi, being the largest
and most industrialized city, displayed a relatively weak performance in
starting and growing IT companies recently as compared to Lahore, the
second largest and industrialized city. This has emanated in part due to
Lahore's relatively better law and order situation, public transport,
provincial support for IT based startups and ability to attract talent
from many parts of the country. Thus, the analysis highlights important
insights into establishing and expanding IT businesses including the
moderating role played by urban policies and governance in Lahore and
Karachi.

Entrepreneurs especially suggested improvement of education system,
commercial dispute resolution system, enforcement of property rights,
quality of infrastructure such as broad band access and public transport
as well as support by the government for small and young firms in the
form of incubation centers, growth funds, favorable public procurement
rules, and tax facilitation.

This qualitative analysis was limited to IT sector entrepreneurs in the
largest cities of Pakistan. A similar research on other sectors cities
in Pakistan can help to generalize the findings of this paper.

Jyoti Bansal's Unusual Ventures takes an unusual route to invest in
startups

Body

Unusual Ventures, a VC firm co-founded by Jyoti Bansal, invests in very
early-stage startups, providing a strong support ecosystem to enable
faster growth.

The failure rate of startups across the world is quite high, and there
are many reasons as to why entrepreneurs fail to turn their budding
ventures into sustainable organisations.

But here is a venture capital fund, which gets in very early into
entrepreneurial orbit so that it can guide, mentor, and walk along with
the founders to create a successful startup.

Unusual Ventures, a California-based venture capital firm founded by
Jyoti Bansal and John Vrionis in 2018, has taken an unchartered
territory into investing in startups at the seed and early stage. The VC
firm closed its second fund at $400 million in November 2019, while its
first one was $160 million, which was 18 months prior.

"The hardest problem for any entrepreneur is going from an idea to
million dollars in revenue, which needs initial messaging, getting
customers, etc. There is no structured platform available which can help
entrepreneurs, and we wanted to change that," Jyoti tells YourStory.

An IIT Delhi alumnus, Jyoti Bansal is a serial entrepreneur in the US
who founded numerous startups and came into prominence after his venture
AppDynamics was acquired by Cisco for $3.7 billion in 2017.

After this exit, Jyoti wanted to translate his experiences as an
entrepreneur in a more structured manner as a venture capitalist, where
he would get in very early into the startup ecosystem. He felt that many
players in the ecosystem were not able to effectively guide these
startups in the early stages.

Key learnings

Jyoti says, there were five typical challenges he faced as an
entrepreneur - how do you get the first set of investors, finding the
product-market fit, to tell the story of the product, powering early
sales going, and lastly how one grows from an engineer to a CEO.

"Based on my learnings, we wanted to rethink how early-stage investments
could be done better, and it was modelled after my experiences," says
Jyoti.

Unusual Ventures decided to focus on the early-stage investments. Jyoti
says, "Most of the times we invest at idea or prototype stage. The
biggest thing we do is to bet on the entrepreneurs and provide a
platform to succeed."

The Indian born entrepreneur feels there is capital available for the
startups, but many fail to succeed due to lack of proper guidance. The
path taken by Unusual Ventures is to be deeply ingrained with a founder
journey of building a startup where it becomes a partner in getting the
right talent, finding the product-market fit, and acquisition of
customers among the many other things.

Unusual Ventures is largely focussed on investing in
business-to-business (B2B) startups and is also interested in
consumer-related ventures. It has invested in around 29 ventures, with
three-fourth of being B2B and rest in the retail consumer domain.

Bet on entrepreneurs

Jyoti has a few parameters in mind before they decide to invest in a
startup.

"We look at the problem space, and it needs to be large. Also, we spend
time with entrepreneurs to understand their high degree of authentic
passion," he says.

Besides this, the VC fund also looks at whether the entrepreneurs have a
unique strength in a particular domain, and more importantly whether
they have the right ethics and integrity.

For Unusual Ventures, ethics and integrity are very high on its agenda.
Even the limited partners in their fund are not the typical financial
institutions or high net worth individuals, but non-profit bodies,
colleges, foundations, endowments, etc.

Beyond capital

Today, Unusual Ventures has created a platform where it provides almost
an end-to-end kind of service for entrepreneurs and founders. Besides
the capital and mentoring, the VC fund also has other services on its
platforms - like the Get Ahead and Academy.

For example, under its Get Ahead initiative, the expertise provided are
in areas such as sales development, marketing messaging, recruiting, and
back-office solutions. In the case of Academy, they get the deep domain
experts to engage with the entrepreneurs.

Unusual Ventures believes in doing a smaller number of investments so
that it can devote greater time and resources into a limited number of
startups.

"We expect to be one of the top-performing fund and most successful
investors are those who come in early," says Jyoti.

The team at Unusual Ventures believe in rolling up their sleeves, find
the best entrepreneurs, and help them grow in a very systematic manner.

No India plans

Amidst these growth plans of Unusual Ventures, the VC fund does not have
any plans to enter India as of now. It is not because of the lack of
opportunity, but it does not have the bandwidth put in that amount of
time or resources in India.

"A big part of what we do is help the companies to succeed. We do not
want to do investments here unless we are sure that we can provide that
help. We need the right bandwidth and infrastructure before we can think
of investing in India," says Jyoti.

However, he says, "We are very bullish about the Indian startup
ecosystem. There were multiple waves that the country has gone through
with IT services companies, followed by consumer tech, and now there is
an exciting opportunity to sell software products to the international
market."

He believes there is a depth of talent in the country, and this is
likely to result in the emergence of B2B startups, which are deep domain
experts in technology.

Unusual Ventures has now raised more than half-a-billion dollars in less
than two years, and it plans to continue with the same strategy of
investment even as it grows larger.

"I like to invest where I can really help," says Jyoti.

Angel Funding: Sailing in Choppy Waters

Highlight: Lack of good exit opportunities, valuation mismatches, and
regulatory and tax issues are some concerns for angel investors

Body

Angel funding by wealthy individuals in India's startup ecosystem is
facing a litmus test, as a lack of good exit opportunities, valuation
mismatches, and regulatory and tax issues have made the seas rough.
This, however, could help separate the wheat from the chaff, say
industry members.

About half of the angel investors in India see only 25% of their
portfolio companies raising follow-on funding, and more than half of
them have not seen any exits so far, shows a survey of 200 angel
investors by LetsVenture, a platform for angel investors. About 70% of
the respondents had invested in the past three-four years or earlier.

One in three angel investors sees exits on only 20% of his/her portfolio
companies, according to the survey, throwing light on the risks of
investing in this asset class.

Thus, even as the number of startups are increasing, angel funding has
been drastically falling, showed a recent report by tech industry body
Nasscom, highlighting the skewed ratio that has left gaps in the
ecosystem.

Seed-stage funding fell by 21% in 2018 and 50% in 2017, while earlystage
funding grew at 4% this year, the Nasscom report showed.

Industry members said the 'angel tax' issue — tax on startups receiving
equity infusion in excess of fair value — continues to be a deterrent
despite recent policy changes, citing high costs for entrepreneurs.

“These challenges have pushed angel investing to mature,” said Sunitha
Ramaswamy, director, LetsVenture. “This is separating the chaff, since a
lot of angels who fail don't invest again, as per our analysis,” she
said.

Follow-on rounds have been slower to come by, and fall short of what is
seen in the US and China, industry members said.

Only 30% of Indian startups with early-stage funding secure Series A
investments, which stands at about 50% in the US and China, said Apoorv
Ranjan Sharma, cofounder of startup incubation platform Venture
Catalysts. He said there is a need for more active early-stage venture
capital firms, which currently stands at about 30.

Active angel investors say it is a game of patience.

“It is important for angel investors to be patient, place enough bets,
and also consider whether they are doing it for financial gains alone,”
said Aprameya Radhakrishna, cofounder of companies such as TaxiForSure
and Vokal, who has made 20 angel investments.

“It is usually a 5-7 year cycle. 12 of the 20 companies I have invested
in have got followon rounds and I have also had offers for exits on a
few,” he said.

According to Rajat Tandon, president of the Indian Private Equity &
Venture Capital Association (IVCA), more robust pre-series A funding
could help address the issues that startups and angel investors face.

“Startups today want to build for scale, not for sale, so they are ready
to wait for the right capital,” Tandon said.

What has further aggravated the capital crunch for startups is that
angels are putting in small amounts.

Nearly half of the angel investors surveyed invest less than Rs 10 lakh,
the LetsVenture survey showed, indicating that angels may be looking to
diversify their portfolio across multiple smallticket investments.

“Seed rounds should be at least Rs 3-6 crore to give enough runway to
the startup and get traction before VC funding,” said Sharma.

The high failure rate in startups has also resulted in only 30% of
investors keeping a reserve pool of capital to maintain their pro-rata
stake in their portfolio companies for subsequent funding rounds. Half
of those surveyed said they maintain their pro-rata holding on a
case-to-case basis.

Returns have also been modest for most angels, usually the principal
amount, Ramaswamy said.

“Most angels usually get back the principal amount, with a maximum of 3x
returns seen among angels,” she added.

Despite the risks, the Indian startup ecosystem is still attracting new
investors and a new profile of angels is emerging.

About 50% of new angel investors are now senior corporate executives or
vertical heads at bigger startups, while others are serial entrepreneurs
and members of family businesses, according to Ramaswamy.

“Executives from larger startups who may have vested their ESOPs are
looking to put the money back into the system,” she said. The next wave
of angels is also coming from beyond the metros, said LetsVenture
cofounder Shanti Mohan.

BENGALURU: Angel funding by wealthy individuals in India's startup
ecosystem is facing a litmus test, as a lack of good exit opportunities,
valuation mismatches, and regulatory and tax issues have made the seas
rough. This, however, could help separate the wheat from the chaff, say
industry members.About half of the angel investors in India see only 25%
of their portfolio companies raising follow-on funding, and more than
half of them have not seen any exits so far, shows a survey of 200 angel
investors by LetsVenture, a platform for angel investors. About 70% of
the respondents had invested in the past three-four years or earlier.One
in three angel investors sees exits on only 20% of his/her portfolio
companies, according to the survey, throwing light on the risks of
investing in this asset class.Thus, even as the number of startups are
increasing, angel funding has been drastically falling, showed a recent
report by tech industry body Nasscom, highlighting the skewed ratio that
has left gaps in the ecosystem.Seed-stage funding fell by 21% in 2018
and 50% in 2017, while early stage funding grew at 4% this year, the
Nasscom report showed.Industry members said the 'angel tax' issue - tax
on startups receiving equity infusion in excess of fair value -
continues to be a deterrent despite recent policy changes, citing high
costs for entrepreneurs."These challenges have pushed angel investing to
mature," said Sunitha Ramaswamy, director, LetsVenture.

"This is separating the chaff, since a lot of angels who fail don't
invest again, as per our analysis," she said.Follow-on rounds have been
slower to come by, and fall short of what is seen in the US and China,
industry members said. Only 30% of Indian startups with early-stage
funding secure Series A investments, which stands at about 50% in the US
and China, said Apoorv Ranjan Sharma, cofounder of startup incubation
platform Venture Catalysts. He said there is a need for more active
early-stage venture capital firms, which currently stands at about
30.Active angel investors say it is a game of patience."It is important
for angel investors to be patient, place enough bets, and also consider
whether they are doing it for financial gains alone," said Aprameya
Radhakrishna, cofounder of companies such as TaxiForSure and Vokal, who
has made 20 angel investments."It is usually a 5-7 year cycle. 12 of the
20 companies I have invested in have got follow on rounds and I have
also had offers for exits on a few," he said.According to Rajat Tandon,
president of the Indian Private Equity & Venture Capital Association
(IVCA), more robust pre-series A funding could help address the issues
that startups and angel investors face."Startups today want to build for
scale, not for sale, so they are ready to wait for the right capital,"
Tandon said.What has further aggravated the capital crunch for startups
is that angels are putting in small amounts.Nearly half of the angel
investors surveyed invest less than Rs 10 lakh, the LetsVenture survey
showed, indicating that angels may be looking to diversify their
portfolio across multiple small ticket investments."Seed rounds should
be at least Rs 3-6 crore to give enough runway to the startup and get
traction before VC funding," said Sharma.The high failure rate in
startups has also resulted in only 30% of investors keeping a reserve
pool of capital to maintain their pro-rata stake in their portfolio
companies for subsequent funding rounds. Half of those surveyed said
they maintain their pro-rata holding on a case-to-case basis.Returns
have also been modest for most angels, usually the principal amount,
Ramaswamy said."Most angels usually get back the principal amount, with
a maximum of 3x returns seen among angels," she added.Despite the risks,
the Indian startup ecosystem is still attracting new investors and a new
profile of angels is emerging.About 50% of new angel investors are now
senior corporate executives or vertical heads at bigger startups, while
others are serial entrepreneurs and members of family businesses,
according to Ramaswamy."Executives from larger startups who may have
vested their ESOPs are looking to put the money back into the system,"
she said. The next wave of angels is also coming from beyond the metros,

Lithium Derivatives Market 2018 Manufacturers, Countries, Type and
Application, Forecast to 2023

Web newswire

August 14, 2018 Tuesday

India, Aug. 14 -- Synopsis of Lithium Derivatives Market

Lithium (CAS NO. 7439-93-2) is the lightest metal in the periodic table
which is extracted from two sources, including spodumene and salt lake
brines and then process manufactured into its derivatives. Lithium
Derivatives are highly reactive and broadly classified into lithium
carbonate, lithium hydroxide, lithium concentrated, lithium chloride,
lithium metal, butyl lithium, and others. Lithium ions have massive
capacity to store energy which makes them favorable for use in the
rechargeable batteries and grid connected storage. Other than that, they
exhibit properties such as viscosity glass modifiers in the glass melts,
high coefficient of thermal expansion, and higher electrochemical
potential as compared to other catalytic metal.

According to the MRFR analysis, Global Lithium Derivatives Market is
projected to reach USD 2,074.2 million by 2023, growing at healthy CAGR
of 5.80%. Factors such as the emergence of the electric vehicles,
growing demand for portable devices, and increasing glass and ceramic
production considered as major growth drivers. China, especially emerged
as a key market, thereby generating robust demand for electric vehicles
in which lithium ion batteries are largely preferred. Furthermore,
consumer electronics industry is on the rise on account of high adoption
of portable devices and significantly driving demand for lithium
derivatives. On the other hand, growth in this market is hampered by
high initial investment cost. Additionally, lack of lithium expertise
manpower in the lithium extraction activities led to failure of the
lithium startup by having a negative impact on the global growth.
Nevertheless, this market will be having several growth prospects in the
years to come due to emerging applications of Lithium Derivative in grid
connected storage as well as aluminum smelting.

Regional Analysis

As per the MRFR analysis, Global Lithium Derivative Market is dominated
by Asia Pacific followed by North America and Europe. Asia Pacific is
the largest region in terms of value and volume and has occupied 53% of
the global market shares as of 2016. China drive Asia Pacific lithium
Derivatives Market by producing majority of lithium-ion batteries due to
emergence of electric vehicle. Moreover, the country has huge automotive
manufacturing base which has contributed driving demand for Lithium
Derivative substantially. Other than that, economic growth, proximity to
cheap labors and presence of numerous small scale Lithium Derivative
producers in this region are the important growth factors. North America
is another attractive region for Lithium Derivatives, including major
market U.S. and Canada. Presence of few leading players in this region
such as Albemarle Corporation (U.S.) and FMC Corporation (U.S.)
stimulated demand for Lithium Derivatives. Europe is a steady market for
Lithium Derivatives and likely to grow relatively faster in the years to
come due to greater adoption of electric vehicles.

Segmentation

The Global Lithium Derivatives Market is majorly segmented on the basis
derivative types, applications and by regions. Based on derivative types
global market has been segmented into lithium carbonate, lithium
hydroxide, lithium concentrate, lithium metal, butyl lithium, lithium
chloride, and others. Market segmentation based on the application
includes batteries, lubricants, medicals, metallurgic, glass ceramic,
aluminum smelting alloys, polymers, and others. Geographically global
market has been segmented into North America, APAC, Europe, Latin
America, and Middle East Africa.

Max Q: Launches from SpaceX, Boeing and the ESA

December 26 -- Max Q is a new weekly newsletter all about space. Sign up
here to receive it weekly on Sundays in your inbox.

Typically, the holiday season is a slow one in the tech industry - but
space tech is different, and this past week saw a flurry of activity,
including one of the most important rocket launches of the year.

Just about every significant new space company got in on the action
during the past seven days, either with actual spacecraft launches, or
with big announcements. And everything that went down sets up 2020 to be
even crazier.

Boeing's big year-end mission doesn't go as plannedBoeing managed to get
a crucial test launch in for its commercial crew program - which is
NASA's effort to get U.S. astronauts launching from U.S. soil once
again. Boeing launched its "orbital flight test" or OFT on Friday, and
the actual rocket launch part of the flight went exactly as intended.

Unfortunately, what came next didn't match up with what was supposed to
happen: The Starliner spacecraft (which wasn't actually carrying anyone
for this test) ran into an error with its onboard mission clock that led
to it expending more fuel more quickly than it should have, leaving it
with not enough fuel to make its planned rendezvous with the ISS.

... but at least it stuck the landingThe Starliner capsule didn't dock
with the Space Station, but it still completed a number of key
objectives, like demonstrating that its docking arm extended properly.
Maybe most importantly, it also landed back on Earth on time and on
target, per the revised mission plan that Boeing and NASA hammered out
once they determined they couldn't reach the station as planned. In
space as in startups, even failures are successes of a kind.

SpaceX launches Falcon 9 but misses the fairing catchSpaceX's latest
launch took place on Monday, and it was a success in just about every
regard - except in terms of one of its secondary missions, which was an
attempt to catch the two fairing halves that together cover the payload
as the rocket ascends to space. SpaceX has been trying to catch these
with ships at sea equipped with large nets, and it caught one
previously. It'll keep trying, just like it did with rocket booster
landings, and could save up to $6 million per launch once it gets the
process right.

Europe launched a planet-watcherThe European Space Agency also launched
a rocket this week - a Soyuz carrying a new satellite that will observe
exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) from orbit. It'll be able
to assess their density from that vantage point, giving us valuable new
info about the potential habitability of distant heavenly bodies.

Apple might enter the satellite constellation game 

 

 

Apple apparently has its own team internally working on satellite
communication technologies. This effort may or may not involve the
iPhone-maker actually developing its own spacecraft, but it seems like
the overall goal is to develop its own direct wireless communication
network to work with iPhones and other Apple hardware.

Amazon is opening a dedicated HQ for its satellite businessMeanwhile,
Amazon's own satellite business is a known quantity called "Project
Kuiper," and the company is going to double down on its investment next
year with a new dedicated space for Kuiper's R&D and prototype
manufacturing. Eventually, Kuiper will be a constellation of low Earth
orbit satellites providing broadband to underserved and unserved areas
of the globe.

Rocket Lab is already working on its third launch pad 

Rocket Lab will be opening a third launch pad, the company announced,
just after declaring its second in Virginia this month. The third launch
site will be at the same spot as its first - on the Mahia peninsula in
northern New Zealand.

5 Intense Entrepreneurial Lessons From India's Freedom Struggle

India fought against the Britishers, and gained its Independence. What
does this teaches?

Disrupt! Create value! Break the status quo! Set the market on fire!
Deliver!

These are some of the modern day anthems for the entrepreneur, who is
seeking to establish their startup in this age of cut-throat
competition.

But long before Google and Facebook happened, a bunch of Indian freedom
fighters dedicated their lives for India's freedom struggle, and made
sure that India gets independence from the Britishers.

No, it was not about term-sheets and profit-loss which motivated them,
but no-compromise love and devotion towards our Motherland, which
inspired them.

While gaining freedom from a superpower and launching a startup are two
extreme things, there are few elements which are common to both the
exercises.

Herein, we discuss those common lessons, which India's freedom struggle
teaches to all entrepreneurs:

Prepare For The Long Haul: Get The Vision Right

Britishers conquered India for a period of 200 years, starting with East
India Company Rule in 1797, British Empire Rule in 1857 till 1947, when
India gained its Independence.

Compared to this, India's freedom struggle lasted for 90 years:
Historians state that the period of struggle started from 1857, and
ended in 1947.

Hence, for almost half the period of British Rule, we fought, we
challenged, we sacrificed, and we hustled. When the freedom struggle
started, did our ancestors knew that how long will it last?

No. But these persisted, with a single aim: India's freedom.

Although modern-day entrepreneurs are powered with AI and Predictions,
but still, no one can say when the goals will be achieved.

Prepare for the long haul, and this can only happen when you are sure of
the goal.

Connect The Dots

Freedom struggle was a movement, which originated at several locations,
ignited by various social and religious factors. While Mangal Pandey
triggered the revolt of Indian soldiers employed by British, there was
Puli Thevar, Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, Rani Velu Nachiyar and several
others, who ignited the flames of freedom struggle in different parts of
the country during 18th and 19th century.

Even without Internet and mobiles during that time, the freedom struggle
gained momentum as dots were connected and communities joined hands for
a common goal.

Entrepreneurship, very similarly, is a movement and the entrepreneur is
never working alone. He needs a team, along with the vision, and he
needs partners and well-wishers.

Connecting the dots is one of the most crucial aspects: It was during
freedom struggle and it is while making the business big.

Leadership Makes The Difference

As the freedom struggle matured and became organized with the inclusion
of political parties such as Congress and Forward Bloc, leader emerged
from all corners of the country.

Be it Mahatma Gandhi or Bhagat Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai or Bal Gangadhar
Tilak; Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose or Jawaharlal Nehru: Leaders inspired
the masses, and inspired them to break the status-quo, challenge the
rule of Britishers and to set themselves free.

In entrepreneurship as well, leadership is what differentiates between
an average startup and a trend-setter.

Instead of being a manager, the entrepreneur needs to become a leader.

Communication Is Vital

There wasn't any Internet or mobile phones during India's freedom
struggle: But still, words formed a bond and led the freedom fighters
towards achieving their ultimate goal.

Magazines like The Indian Sociologist, pamphlets like Bande Mataram and
Oh Martyrs! by Savarkar ignited that zeal and passion among freedom
fighters, all over the nation.

Poets and writers united: Subramania Bharati, Rabindranath Tagore,
Muhammad Iqbal, Josh Malihabadi, Mohammad Ali Jouhar, Bankim Chandra
Chattopadhyay wrote and shipped fiery speeches, articles and stories to
motivate the freedom fighters.

Similarly, in this age of entrepreneurship, communication is vital.
Although the medium to propagate a thought and idea has become easier
(website, blogs, mobile phones, messenegrs), but the core remains tough:
How to express the idea in the most meaningful way?

Again, vision and goal of the whole exercise is crucial, as without
them, the communication will fail. The vision and objectives of freedom
fighters were crystal clear, and this is the reason that even without
Internet and smartphones, they united and fought against a common enemy.

Determination Is Bravery

If we ask Historians, about that single factor which made all the
difference in India's freedom struggle, then it will be sheer
determination.

During World War 1, British had a massive army of 2 million soldiers,
and India was their slaves. We didn't had any military, and the freedom
struggle was all chaos.

Then came Mahatma Gandhi with his vision of non-violence, and we
suddenly had a superpower, which defeated the mighty Britishers.

Determination, persistence and goal were the foundation on which freedom
fighters believed, and acted upon.

When you are launching your own startup, then the odds would be against.
The default state of a startup is failure, but success is not
impossible.

Determination is bravery: Whether it was India's freedom struggle, or
your startup.

Happy Independence Day to all!

formed by Gobi Partners and Core Capital in 2018. e27[20] Going green:
What types of ethical investments can you partake in?; The concept has
been gaining ground in recent years due to growing environmental and
geopolitical concerns; Today, ethical investing is a lot more
sophisticated and there are multiple asset classes that address a wide
range of environmental and social concerns; You must ensure that your
portfolio is curated to align with your personal values and beliefs.
SingSaver blog[21] Are central bank digital currencies (CBCDs) a
game-changer?; CBDCs hold a lot of promise: they could allow anyone to
receive salary payments, invest in a private company in Switzerland, and
automate their health insurance claim from a single app on their mobile
phone; All these could be accomplished without having to log into
multiple accounts, exchange local currency for Swiss francs, or file any
additional forms. TechInAsia[22] How to use OKRs to avoid startup
failures; One of the biggest benefits of using OKRs is the 'surfacing up
of problems' early; The weekly reviews ensure the uncovering of problems
as every team needs to report their progress as well as confidence level
in achieving their key result; In the the case of early-stage startups,
reviews can be done even twice a week or daily until they find the
product/market fit. e27[23] — Photo by Markus Winkler[24]on Unsplash[25]

As heat rises, startups head to the deals table

MINT

May 10, 2020 Sunday

Dateline: New Delhi

New Delhi, May 10 -- As the novel coronavirus started spreading rapidly
across the country in the second week of March, internet startups were
among the first off the block to adopt work from home (WFH) policies. An
entrepreneur Mint spoke to attributed this to the fact that startups
grasp the concept of "virality" far better than other companies.

Yet, many startups had remained more or less sanguine then about their
prospects, convinced that no matter how bad things got, demand for
digital products and services would soar as the fear of transmission
would keep hundreds of millions of people at home.

Two months later, that optimism has turned into dread.

At many companies, revenues have vanished, supply chains have been
thrown into disarray and piling costs have depleted cash reserves. Even
after the national lockdown ends on 17 May, demand is likely to remain
weak for a long time. Sales will fluctuate wildly for several months
depending on outbreaks of the virus and attendant lockdowns, making
efficient cost management tough or impossible, especially for those
startups that have physical operations.

Even before covid-19 struck, loss-making internet startups across the
world were facing a reckoning, as years of heavy spending failed to
produce profits. The pandemic has demolished any hopes that startups
would have a "soft landing."

Rather, the crisis will lead to large numbers of startup failures, as
deprived of capital, ill-conceived business models collapse, investors
said. In addition to more startup failures and a wide drop in
valuations, a spike in mergers and acquisitions (M&As), especially
distressed sales, is expected over the coming year, driven largely by
investor attempts to cut losses and save face.

Rising dread

More than 14,000 startups, including unfunded firms, have shut shop
since Tracxn Technologies Pvt. Ltd, a data platform, started tracking
this number in 2016. Over the past two months, more than 250 startups
have already shut shop, according to Tracxn, which calls the list
"Deadpool." This number is expected to increase sharply in the coming
months.

Funding data, too, already reflects a sharp slowdown. So far this year,
Indian startups have raised $3.3 billion in capital, according to
Tracxn. With mega funding rounds unlikely, this indicates that funding
will be much lower this year than the $15.7 billion Indian startups
raised in 2019.

"Startup closures will increase significantly over the next year
(compared with the past), and we should expect more M&A activity as
well," said Abhishek Goyal, co-founder, Tracxn. "For startups that had a
mediocre business model or were losing a lot of money on every
transaction, it will be very tough to raise funding now. If you were
burning money to achieve scale and then hoping to figure out a business
model-these kinds of startups will struggle badly."

New restrictions on Chinese investors announced by India last month have
added to the uncertainty around startup funding. Besides, the missteps
by Japan's SoftBank Group, which have prompted the company to cut its
investment pace, have created a wide gap in late-stage funding.

Goyal, however, added that if a vaccine or cure is found for the virus
any time this year, then internet startups "will see a correction (in
funding and valuations) rather than a bloodbath."

"Like 2016-17 and 2012-14, there will be one cycle of correction this
time, too. Even before the virus spread, there was talk of a funding
slowdown. The virus has only sped it up. In addition, because SoftBank
isn't as aggressive any more, late-stage funding will suffer. We could
see private equity firms doing more late-stage deals, and they usually
offer (lower valuations and funding amounts compared with SoftBank). So
there should be a correction in valuations," Goyal said.

Already, many well-funded startups including Oyo, Swiggy, Zomato,
Cure.fit and others have cut jobs and salaries to reduce cash burn. Some
companies are moving into newer categories that could prosper in the
post-covid-19 world. But these efforts will not nearly fill the revenue
shortfall in their core businesses, while already-low margins will
decline further.

Taking their cue, investors have started either delaying investments or
demanding lower valuations-"down rounds"-as the price of new capital.

Deeper cost cuts and steeper falls in valuations at startups are
expected over the coming months as a devastating economic recession,
more severe than any that India has experienced in decades, takes hold,
entrepreneurs and investors said. Startups are facing a long-drawn-out
downturn, which is likely to last more than two years, they said.

Merge or perish

One obvious exit route for startups and investors in this environment is
M&A.

Startups in many sectors are considering mergers-venture capitalists are
driving these discussions. These sectors include: the new crop of
ride-sharing startups, social commerce and online lending. All these
sectors have been badly hit by the covid-19 crisis. These sectors have
several mid-sized startups that were burning through cash battling each
other in order to gain market share. Till now, no clear winners had
emerged, even as losses rose.

"Consolidation of smaller firms in a sector, say a No. 2 and No. 3
player coming together to survive or take on the market leader, only
makes sense if their respective investors commit to putting significant
capital in the merged entity," said Ritesh Banglani, partner, Stellaris
Venture Partners, a Bengaluru-based early-stage venture fund. "But there
has to be a strong case for consolidation, otherwise M&A is more a
face-saving step for investors."

Banglani added that prices will be attractive for potential acquirers
because many companies could struggle to raise capital in this
environment.

Already, some large acquisitions have been discussed.

Mukesh Ambani's Reliance, which has bought several startups including
Haptik, Fynd and Embibe over the past two years, is in discussions to
buy medicine delivery firm Netmeds, according to a person familiar with
the matter. The news was reported earlier by The Times of India. Various
media outlets have also reported that Zomato held early talks to buy
grocery delivery firm Grofers for more than $750 million, though the two
companies have denied holding the discussions.

Anand Lunia, founding partner, India Quotient, an early-stage venture
fund in Mumbai, agreed and said that Reliance and other large companies
in different sectors may buy internet startups in higher numbers over
the next two years compared with the past.

"We will see M&A activity in two cases. One, of the strategic kind,
where a big firm makes acquisitions. Because prices are attractive,
companies like Reliance may buy more companies, or banks may buy fintech
startups in strategic areas. Second, where investors drive mergers
between high-burn companies that aren't doing all that well. There are
many sectors that are quite crowded and where many companies have been
trying for many years to become big but haven't succeeded. In such a
time, where funding is very difficult to get, the investors will decide
to throw in the towel and try to merge with the one remaining leader in
the space," he said.

One space that seems ripe for consolidation or startup failures is
fintech. Apart from lending, many companies have cropped up in spaces
like payments, wealth management, neo-banking and insurance. Many of
these companies have struggled to acquire scale and differentiate
themselves. They could become "zombie" firms in this slowdown, prompting
their investors to push for distress sales or to cut them loose.

"It's a tough market for fintech because the move to profitability has
been forcefully accelerated," B. Amrish Rau, chief executive officer of
payments firm Pine Labs, said. "We are more likely to see M&A of the
distressed kind. Many companies hadn't built solid business models, and
they are especially vulnerable now. In lending, for instance, even NBFCs
(non-banking financial companies) and some banks are in trouble. How
will a lending startup with a tough model stand a chance? Those
companies that hadn't raised capital before this started will have to
consider their options."

Build over buy

While investors are hoping for more and bigger deals by companies like
Reliance, they are less hopeful of Indian unicorns (startups with
billion-dollar valuations) making big acquisitions.

Strategic acquisitions by internet companies can be tricky to pull off,
as was the case with Snapdeal's acquisition of payments firm FreeCharge.
After buying FreeCharge for more than $400 million in 2015, Snapdeal was
forced to sell the company for just $60 million in 2017 to raise cash in
order to stay afloat.

To be sure, apart from FreeCharge, some of the largest acquisitions in
the Indian startup ecosystem have worked out well for the buyers and
their investors. For instance, Flipkart's acquisitions of Myntra and
PhonePe; PayU's acquisition of Citrus Pay; and Naspers' buy of RedBus
have all yielded windfall gains for the respective acquirers.

Still, in this environment, when many of India's most valuable unicorns
like Oyo and Ola are battling for survival, acquisitions by them are
unlikely. Even the few unicorns that are thriving in the covid-19 crisis
are hesitant to make big bets.

PolicyBazaar is a case in point. Along with Bigbasket and Byju's, the
insurance retailer is one of the few large internet startups that hasn't
been hurt by the covid-19 crisis. PolicyBazaar, in fact, has increased
its advertising spending to cash in on the increasing demand for health
and life insurance and expand its market share. It is better-placed than
most others to make a risky acquisition.

Last year, PolicyBazaar asked an executive to bring attractive
acquisition targets to the company's notice. Over the past eight months,
PolicyBazaar has vetted 15-20 companies every month. Yet, the company
found "nothing worth buying," said PolicyBazaar co-founder and group
chief executive officer Yashish Dahiya.

"We just didn't think it adds value to us. In cases where we found
something interesting, we looked at whether we should buy it or do it
in-house, and doing it in-house seemed to be much easier. We figured
that with one or two employees we can build it, so why bother? If we
find that somebody has built a product that we can't replicate in six
months and that adds value, we'll certainly buy. But we haven't found
that yet," Dahiya said.

One reason behind PolicyBazaar's avoidance of M&A is that the company
has found valuations to be "inflated." "The other reason is that people
just haven't done that much ground-breaking stuff. If somebody has gone
and let's say build a partnership with an insurance company where they
are selling some new policy, we could replicate that (easily)," Dahiya
added.

In conclusion

Another factor that complicates M&A, at least among unicorns, is the
fear of the antitrust regulator. In the past, food delivery companies
Swiggy and Zomato, as well as the two largest transportation apps, Uber
India and Ola, have considered merging.

But apart from the disinclination of the founders of these companies to
join hands with their rivals, what stopped merger talks from moving
forward was the belief that a combination would be opposed by the
Competition Commission of India (CCI).

The same belief played a part in Flipkart choosing to sell itself to
Walmart instead of Amazon in 2018.

"It is unlikely that there will be consolidation among unicorns. In most
sectors, there are virtual duopolies. The CCI has been very active in
the internet space, so it is unlikely that they will approve of two big
internet companies in a sector coming together," a venture capitalist
said, on condition of anonymity.

12 inspirational quotes by Oyo's Ritesh Agarwal on how to become a
successful entrepreneur

Twenty-six-year-old Ritesh Agarwal is rated among India's most
celebrated young entrepreneurs. Born in Odisha, he comes from a
middle-class business family.

Ritesh started selling SIM cards at the age of 13 for survival.
Determined to take a different course for his life, he decided to travel
across India on a shoestring budget, and saw an opportunity to bring
order to the hospitality industry.

At the age of 18, Ritesh started a budget accommodation portal called
Oravel Stays to book budget hotels, which was later renamed and launched
as OYO Rooms in May 2013.

In September 2018, OYO raised $1 billion led by SoftBank Vision Fund. In
July 2019, it was reported that Agarwal purchased shares worth $2
billion in the company, tripling his stake. Currently valued at $10
billion, Ritesh-led OYO has expanded to over 800 cities in over 80
countries, and claims to have hosted over 50 million guests so far.

Being one of the youngest self-made entrepreneurs, his net worth was
approximately estimated at $1 billion (Rs 7,500 crore) in 2019,
according to IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List.

Ritesh dropped out of college to fulfil his entrepreneurial dreams and
went against all the social norms to become the youngest successful
entrepreneur of our country. He was also the first Asian to graduate as
a Thiel Fellow (the Thiel Fellowship backed by PayPal founder Peter
Thiel), receiving a grant of $100,000.

A youth icon, Ritesh has definitely put a remarkable footprint through
his journey.

Let's take a look at some of the inspirational quotes by the
entrepreneur :

"It is extremely important to build something that a 100 people
absolutely love using rather than make something that a 1,000 people
would just, kind of, like."

"Hire people not for today but for 2-3 years from now, and let them grow
with the company."

"The reality of startup is you have failures very often."

"Having a passion for solving a big problem and leaving a huge impact.
Once you have that, everything else falls into place."

"Your brand reflects your culture, purpose, and identity. It's never too
early to start thinking about it."

"Stay away from family when you are working on a startup. They make your
life difficult."

"Bring people who are ready to stick their neck out for the mission of
the company."

"Start small, nail it, and then make it big."

"You must be willing to stretch out of your comfort zone, take risks,
and be emotional (in a good way) about your venture and the stakeholders
involved."

"As an entrepreneur, you have to be open to taking risks, especially
when the downside is limited but the upside is high."

"I am yet to hear of an entrepreneur who can claim to have succeeded
without making mistakes."

"We ignore the noise and the distractions. We know our vision, our
goals - and we just focus on getting there before anyone else can."

The art of a good unicorn | Pivot, pivot, pivot

Hindustan Times

June 14, 2022 Tuesday

Length: 804 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, June 14 -- If you were to take a flight from Mumbai to Paris, the
odds are the aeroplane may not 100% stick to its flight path. It
constantly adjusts. There are re-calculations to correct the gap between
where the plane is and where it ought to be. That's a seemingly perfect
analogy for our lives, and as long as we're holding our joystick in our
hands, we curb the risk of drifting off course.

Yet, we also have what's known as the survivorship bias. We tend to
glorify and admire the successors of survivors and people who thrived,
despite facing obstacles. Those who failed, tend to sweep their stories
under the rug, because it makes the rose-coloured glasses we look
through foggy. Therein lies the problem: Our ability to systematically
underestimate the role of correction.

When the unicorn Gupshup started out, it was a Twitter-like community
website that allowed users to join groups and get updates through SMSes.
At one point, it was so big that it had more users than Facebook and
Twitter in India. But more success meant putting in more money and
because of this, they were quickly running out of cash. A near-death
experience made them take a B2B (Business-to-Business) pivot to become a
forum, where enterprises could experience conversational experiences and
have messages like payment confirmation, one-time passwords (OTPs) and
more sent to customers. It is now a global leader in conversational
messaging, claiming over six billion messages each month across 30
messaging channels.

Or think about India's first unicorn InMobi, which was born out of a
pivot. It started as mKhoj, an SMS-based search and monetisation
business. Then it pivoted and renamed itself to what it's called now,
becoming a mobile advertising business and rose to much greater heights.

Many startups are pivoting to carpe diem and seize the day, transform
their business models, and navigate turbulent waters. They're trying to
rebuild themselves from the ground up, fundamentally change their DNA,
and appeal to consumers in the new normal. But what about startups that
have lost the plot, when it comes to facing tough times and challenges
and have gone so far as to even lose their unicorn status? What about
falling apart after pivoting? Did they overestimate their set-up?

The startup phenomenon probably has that kind of tunnel vision.
Entrepreneurs are probably willing to forego the crushing failures that
startups would go through and just focus on the ones that made it, so
that they could feel inspired enough to go through the muck and have the
temerity to come out the other side successful. But if they actually go
down that path, they're surprised by the lack of stability and may
overestimate their chances of success. However, entrepreneurs need to
keep in mind at all times that the art of the good unicorn - an
entrepreneur's ultimate goal for their startup - can only be
accomplished through constant readjustment. Is it possible that
entrepreneurs would be reluctant to make pivots, restructure and
course-correct?

Maybe it's because they think that just because repair work and revision
are taking place, there must be a flaw in the plan, which is a fallacy.
The good life of a startup and its constant success could only be bred
through constant readjustment. It's about incessant fine-tuning and
nurturing at every stage. For a startup to even get to the path of a
unicorn, they have to constantly combat their shortcomings and mitigate
their inadequacies. That means a whole lot of pivots, which might be a
kind of rite of passage for fledgling businesses.

A founder shouldn't run towards the light just because there's something
new and shiny. Don't have "shiny object syndrome", according to experts.
It doesn't mean discarding an existing foundation for new rhetoric. That
rhetoric has to hold up to reality and be viable and it could truly take
your startup to new heights. Even if it is, you have to be honest with
yourself to wonder why you're making this pivot and stand behind it
100%. You can't make a pivot just because you don't feel like committing
to a business model and seeing it through. Don't chase the "what ifs"
just to see what's available, because you're only going to waste your
own precious time before reaching a path to profitability. Only go for
the pie in the sky when your feet are grounded to the earth.

When it comes to being a startup trying to become a unicorn, don't be a
"minimum guy". Don't be a pividiot.

March 25 -- As week one of social distancing and quarantining comes to
an end - and the realities of it all set in -we've been coming up with
ways to (try) staying fit during the COVID-19 outbreak. From virtual
classes to YouTube to making the most out of your home environment,
here's how TNW's editorial team plan on burning calories while trapped
at home - and how you can too.

Bodyweight workout - Callum Booth 

 

Because I do my best to be a Fit Boy(TM) (and am basically unbearable),
I've been building my own bodyweight workout to beat this damn lockdown.

"But what sort of bodyweight workout?" I hear my legions of fans
screaming.

Well, I'm glad you asked. Because I live on the second floor apartment
built in the 1880s (what I like to refer to as pre-Joe Wicks times),
there are certain exercises that would probably force my also
quarantined neighbors to burst out of their flats, cut me up into tiny
pieces, and make a Fit Boy Segments Health Shake(TM) out of my remains.
This means I avoid stuff like running on the spot, intense burpees, or
slapping the floor like Charlton Heston in Planet Of The Apes.

[Read: 7 tips for my fellow humans stuck working from home]

Instead, I've started building a non-impact bodyweight workout from
scratch. Yeah, I'm an inspiration, no need to remind me.

Now, one of the mistakes people fresh to exercise (or even just another
type of exercise) is trying to do too much at once. 

So in this set I've begun with five simple exercises: planks, dips,
push-ups, sit-ups, and squats with a three-second hold at the bottom. I
do three circuits of these exercises each session, the whole thing
taking between 15 and 25 minutes depending on the day.

It took one or two sessions to find the optimum number of reps for each
exercise, but once you're in that position, you're laughing. Well, not
literally, because this workout is painful and will make you fucking
weep if you do it right.

And, goddamn, do the tears cascade down my sweaty, agonized face.

To make sure this workout stays fresh, you want to evaluate your
progress each week. Try adding some more reps to each exercise and,
importantly, introduce something new into the routine. Try side planks,
Hindu push-ups, single leg glute bridges, mountain climbers - really any
number of awesome bodyweight exercises you can discover if you do a
quick Google search.

I guess this is the point where I'm meant to say something motivational
and inspiring, but as a quasi-Fit Boy(TM), I've not gotten that far
yet. 

So, uh, have good exercise duration?

YouTube yoga and walks - Már Másson Maack   

 

Now I'm no Fit Boy(TM) as I've never been that big on working out, but
coronavirus lockdowns make it all too clear that humans need some form
of exercise to stay sane. Since being stuck working from home, my
girlfriend and I have made sure to go on brisk lunch walks (about 2 km)
to energize for the afternoon, as well as doing yoga at home.

The thing is, our apartment is tiny so there's normally not enough
room for two people doing yoga at the same time. But in the times of
COVID-19, you've got to put the effort in to keep your body healthy, so
don't shy away from rearranging your whole apartment to get some
exercise done. That means moving any sofas, tables, and other furniture
in your way - feng shui be damned - for even the shortest yoga programs.

Our go-to online yoga instructor is Yoga with Adriene, as she's got a
ton of great videos for free on YouTube, with a great balance between
exercise and mindfulness. You can find great one-off lessons that suit
you (e.g. yoga for sensitive knees) or try out one of her 30-day yoga
challenges (she's got quite a few) which help you slowly build up
strength and continuously improve. My girlfriend and I have always meant
to try to stick to the 30-day challenges (spoiler alert: It never
worked), but you could argue now's the perfect time to give it a go.

 

Running and YouTube workout - Cara Curtis 

 

The year I decided would be my time to get fit, coronavirus decided to
spread across the globe. While I'm tempted to see this as fate and a
clear sign that I shouldn't train to run marathons, it turns out I need
exercise for more than just physical health. Currently in the UK,
specifically London, the government advice warns against mass gatherings
so I'm still running solo around parks. But once the inevitable call is
made to ban all non-essential outdoor time, I'm going to have to get
creative when it comes to exercising, especially in a small London
apartment. 

Running indoors simply won't work. I'd have to do 5,000 laps of my
living room just to hit 3km. So instead, I'm going to be using YouTube
workout tutorials which is something I've always wanted to do anyway.
Similarly to Már, I'm going to start with Yoga with Adriene, a yoga
teacher with hundreds of tutorials and 6.28 million subscribers. She
caters to all levels and has a very calming presence, something we all
need right now. 

I already know I'm going to miss running, not to mention how worried I
am about my depleting Strava stats. 

Zwift and Sufferfest - Matthew Beedham 

 

As a cyclist in my spare time, I'm used to spending the winter months
training in the garage on a turbo trainer in solitary confinement. It's
one of the best ways to avoid the cold and wet winter days, and maintain
fitness for spring. I've already ridden over 1,000km this winter on a
Tacx smart trainer, and it's been relatively enjoyable. 

At this time of year I would normally be outside training, which I can
still do alone. I prefer riding alone anyway, so no change there. But
when I must stay indoors, the online training-come-video games Zwift and
the Sufferfest have been absolute godsends. 

In short, hooking my race bike up to the smart trainer and firing up
Zwift or Sufferfest means I can complete an incredibly focused, intense,
and accurate workout without leaving my house. 

Zwift is great because some of my friends back in the UK use it,
and when we all get the chance, we can ride - and race - together in its
virtual world. Sufferfest, on the other hand, has a few other tricks up
its sleeve: Yoga, strength and mental training. When the mood takes me,
I've been dabbling in a few yoga sessions to keep things interesting. 

Perhaps the best bit though, unlike Cara, I don't have to worry about
losing Strava stats. All the workouts I complete on Zwift and Sufferfest
upload directly to the fitness tracking platform. All my virtual miles,
personal records, and suffer scores are recorded as normal.

Honestly, I'd be quite content - given the circumstances - to carry on
training like this for the rest of the year if I have to.

The only downside is that my life does feel an awful lot like that Black
Mirror episode, 'Fifteen Million Merits.'

 

 

MMA YouTube - Abhimanyu Ghoshal 

 

Since I don't have a lot of gym equipment at home, I'm following MMA
legend Bas Rutten's workout, which only requires a pair of dumbbells and
a little room to move around. The intense half-hour routine involves
shadow boxing, squats, lunges, push-ups, and weights. It's surprisingly
difficult to get through the entire set while maintaining your form, so
I'd recommend aiming for 14 minutes to start, and adding on a minute
every couple of days.This workout is from an old DVD set, which you can
find on Amazon. Alternatively, you can look up Bas Rutten's MMA
All-Around Workout on YouTube and follow along with other fit folks who
run through the entire routine while following his instructions. Once
you know the shadow boxing combinations and each exercise, you only
really need the audio to follow along.

 

Running around the patio and online yoga - Yessi Bello-Perez 

 

I'm trying to eat as healthily as possible but the truth is I've been
munching on chocolate, crisps, and doing the occasional set of squats in
between. 

Bearing in mind that a lockdown is imminent here in the UK, I'm planning
to be more strict with regards to both diet and exercise in the longer
term.

I'm lucky because I have a garden, so it's likely I'll be running around
my patio furniture just to try and get my step count up. The squats will
continue, and I will definitely be picking up my weights (4kgs, don't
judge me!) and doing some light arm and leg exercises to tone and keep
my fitness levels up. I'm also considering running up and down the
stairs, but I'll have to think about this a little because I'm pretty
clumsy.  My yoga teacher is running online sessions so I will try and
attend as many as possible. 

I think it's important to do what's right for you and not to beat
yourself up if you don't stick to your routine every single day. These
are unprecedented times and seeing peoples' home workouts on Instagram
stories can be a little overwhelming. Try and do as much as you can and
find something you actually enjoy doing so it feels like less of a
chore. 

Dumbbells, weightlifting, and pullups - Thomas Macaulay 

 

I've been working out at home for quite a while as I've got a
weightlifting bench, dumbbells, and pullup bar. They take up quite a bit
of space, but can be packed away quite quickly if necessary. Would
definitely recommend the pullup bar for anyone who wants to do strength
training, and a skipping rope for some cardio. I also do yoga by
following classes on YouTube. There's loads of them.

Nintendo Ring Fit Aventure - Rachel Kaser 

 

I've been breaking in my Nintendo Switch game, Ring Fit Adventure,
though admittedly I probably would even without the quarantine. I'm
missing my usual dance classes, if only because I'm less motivated
without my teacher's energy, but at least no one can see me in my room,
doing strange things with a plastic ring and some Joy-Con.

 

Like Yessi, I'm also lucky enough to have a yard. I also have a dog
that, while getting on in years, much prefers the yard to the house, so
we're getting out when the rain isn't too bad. Even without the
exercise, it's just nice to get some fresh air now and then.

Also, if anyone needs a reminder, you can set your Fitbit to yell at you
to get up every now and then. Since I've been working from home since
before this started, I've had it set up to tell me to move just so I
don't get deep vein thrombosis on an average work day.

Jogging and "heart points" - Tristan Greene 

 

I'm lucky enough to be self-quarantining with my family on a beach in
Baja, so I can still get outside for long walks and jogging on the
shore. Aside from that, it's lots of stretching and deep dives into my
Google Fit statistics to make sure I'm getting enough "heart points" -
just like Link from The Legend of Zelda. 

Jogging - Bryan ClarkLike Tristan, I'm also lucky enough to be
quarantined on the Pacific. Since the gym is closed due to coronavirus,
I've recently taken up this new fad called, uh, jogging. I believe it's
"jogging" or "yogging" - it might be a soft "j". I'm not sure but
apparently you just run for an extended period of time. It's supposed to
be wild.

I miss the gym. Running makes me cry. But at least the scenery is nice.

Virtual fitness classes - Anouk 

 

My indoor fitness routine stems from the time I was either too lazy
and/or poor to go to the gym, and I've perfected it over time. You'll
need:

-   One yoga mat

3.  A mirror (someone people hate watching themselves exercising, I find
    it helpful)

3.  Dumbbells (I don't have dumbbells so I always use bottles of laundry
    detergent)

2.  Towel

2.  A water bottle

1.  A laptop, tablet, or phone

I have tried many virtual fitness classes over time, but I always come
back to this power pilates class: 

 

It is the most efficient 30-minute workout ever created. It features
Linda, the creator of the workout, the host, Anna, who's very annoying
and cheery, and one other woman who doesn't talk for some reason. I've
seen it so many times I can recite it word for word - Anna keeps talking
about obliques and to this day I don't know what they are - but it's
still very effective.

To get a full workout, I often combine two different training sessions:
to start with, the first 17 minutes from this cardio-focused video below
(high knees and mountain climbers, that kind of stuff) before moving on
to the 30-minute power pilates video above.

 

Cult.fit - Ivan 

 

I'm a member of a fitness chain called Cult.fit which involves a ton of
exercise forms such as boxing, strength training, and HIIT (High
Intensity Interval Workout). A lot of workouts even at the chain's gym
doesn't involve any equipment.

Luckily, Cult.fit also has an app that hosts live workout sessions, and
a ton pre-recorded workouts. So, I try and join these sessions when I
can.

However, with this gloomy atmosphere all around, I often don't get
motivated enough to go through these sessions. So, I've developed
another workout routine: I take a small break from work, play a song,
and repeat a number of exercises while it's playing. Yep, I'm ready to
be "Lifehacker Ninja" or any other fancy title management people can
come up with as my new official designation.

Hopefully we can keep up these fitness routines for at least three
months - the amount of time the UK government advised our lives would be
disrupted. It's times like this that we're thankful for YouTube's
existence with its endless video options for time-wasting content or
hours of footage on how to get shredded at home.

development, having advised - and learned from - mo... (show all)

startupgenome 

This is the first of a series of articles by research and innovation
policy adviser Startup Genome about the impact of the current crisis on
the Global Startup Ecosystems. 

As our world is shaken in the most dramatic way imaginable, it is time
for our global startup community to get closer, support, and learn from
each other. Some of us remember the crash of 1987 and the dot-com bubble
burst of 2000, in addition to the 2007 financial crisis. Not only is its
human impact horrible, but the current economic crisis is more sudden
and can easily end up being worse.

In order for our startups to survive this crisis, it's important to
understand what's happening elsewhere through the successive waves of
shock hitting regions ahead of us, and identify the public policy and
private actions that are having a positive impact.

Let's first look at ground zero of the crisis and learn from the Chinese
experience as a baseline for what can happen in the rest of the world. 

China's industrial output already dropped 13.5% in January and February
while retail sales decreased by 20.5% year-on-year. Because venture
capitalists invest on medium and long term potential, the impact was
much more acute.

Chinese VC deals have contracted between 50 and 57 percentage points
since the onset of the crisis. If a drop like that happens globally,
even for just two months, approximately $28 billion in startup
investment will go missing in 2020, with a dramatic impact on startups.

A Flourish chart

When we break down the numbers by region, we see that China saw the
biggest drop in funding, followed by the rest of Asia. This isn't
surprising considering the importance of Chinese capital throughout
Asia's startup ecosystems and the start of the epidemic in Taiwan and
Korea in February. 

A Flourish chart

Credit: Startup Genome% Change in Number of VC Deals from Nov-Dec 2019
to Jan-Feb 2020

It's important to note that this drop in VC deals isn't a seasonal dip
due to the Chinese New Year. The previous three years show an equal or
higher number of deals in January as compared to December. You can find
more analysis and charts  in our upcoming COVID-19 and Startup
Ecosystems Series.

Of course, the changes in numbers may not only be due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Data on startups is never perfect, and what we present here is
no exception. For example, funding rounds can take a while to show up in
funding databases. To address that issue we focused on Series A and
later rounds, which have lesser delays in reporting - unlike Seed
rounds. The trends we report here are supported by our partners and
friends on the ground.

If a drop like what we saw in China happens globally, approximately $28
billion in startup investment will go missing in 2020, with a dramatic
impact on startups. Many startups will be unable to raise a new round of
funding. The first to run out of cash will be those who had started to
fundraise in the last few months, nearing the end of their runway before
the crash. 

It's difficult to assess how big of a percentage of startups will fail,
but with startups needing to raise money every 12 to 18 months with
three to six months worth of cash at closing, a six-month drought in VC
deals could wipe out a large portion of startups - and worse if we
consider the potentially fatal direct and indirect blow to one's
business model and operations (e.g. reduction in customer purchasing
power, disappearing suppliers, etc).     

How ecosystems can actConsidering this scenario and the fact that
startups have become the number one engine of job creation in our modern
economies, it's imperative for governments and private leaders to learn
what can be done from each other and act in a concerted fashion. 

It's also important to remember that while startup failures will
increase, such a crisis also radically opens up the competitive
landscape to those who can weather the storm. For this reason and as our
friend Dane Stangler wrote, about half of Fortune 500 companies started
during a recession or bear market. 

To continue our mission of supporting startup success globally, we are
closely monitoring the situation and what it means for founders and
ecosystems. We are reshaping our global knowledge network with our
members across 25 countries to collect public and private policies being
enacted and will be sharing them through a series of articles, posts
and/or knowledge platforms. We are launching the first installment soon
in our COVID-19 and Startup Ecosystems Series: You can sign up to get it
here. 

We are finding some promising initiatives. Denmark, for example, is
covering 75% of salaries for companies that do not cut staff, while
Germany is offering to cover 60% of the new salaries for employees
reduced from full to part time. 

You can subscribe to and contribute public and private policy
solutions - and be among the first to get the COVID-19 and Startup
Ecosystems Series - by signing up here. 

P.S. On a more individual note, Dr. Cosmin Gheorghe and Arnobio Morelix
are hosting a free collaborative workshop for entrepreneurs stuck inside
who want to work on their mental fitness.

How to perfect your pitch deck - according to a guy that gets a lot of
pitches

New Delhi, Mar. 19 -- One of the most critical tasks startups face, is
creating a killer elevator pitch - a short, verbal description of who
they are, what they do, and how they are going to succeed as a business.
There are countless blog posts and listicles that have been created to
guide founders through this process, but they rarely include how to get
to actually get the chance to do the elevator pitch.

The elevator pitch process has led to parodies on sites like the Startup
Elevator Pitch Generator and "it's like x for y" pitch roulette sites.
This doesn't mean that creating an elevator pitch isn't a challenge or
important - it is. However, there's another critical pitch that's just
as important, but is often overlooked in terms of media attention - the
pitch deck.

Creating a pitch deck that your startup can use to attract investment
from VCs is a vitally important milestone. Your elevator pitch is
essential for face-to-face meetings and other opportunities to pitch in
person.

However, before a startup can even secure a meeting or a face-to-face
opportunity with a VC, they often have to go through digital
gatekeepers. In that process, a killer pitch deck is a startup's golden
ticket through the gate to secure that all important meeting. Here's
what you need to know when creating the ultimate pitch. Getting
started - A teaser for your startup

Before starting to craft the deck, every founder has to understand one
simple, yet crucial concept: it's a teaser, its purpose is to whet the
appetite of potential investors and reach the next stage. If your
startup is a movie, then the pitch deck isn't even a trailer. It's the
few short seconds of teaser before the trailer even starts - a trailer
for a trailer.

Being a teaser, your pitch needs to be super concise and to the point.
You have only a few moments to grab the attention of your audience, and
the attention span of a VC is even shorter than you might think. You
need to have a laser-focus on the most important aspects of your
business. Bringing the pitch into focus

If the secret to real-estate is "location, location, location," then the
secret to a perfect pitch deck is "focus, focus, focus." What's
remarkable is how many founders struggle to explain what they actually
do.

This can happen because they simply struggle to synthesize their story
into an easy-to-understand message or because they are trying to tell
too broad of a story. In addition, most VCs aren't necessarily experts
in the field startups are operating in, so it's important to use the
right language and present the appropriate level of information that VCs
will understand. Meet DoggyHut - A totally awesome and fictional startup

I've seen lots of advice for startups on how to build the "perfect"
pitch deck. However, all of that advice doesn't carry the same weight as
seeing a real-world example. So, based on my years of being pitched by
startups, I built what I see as the ideal pitch deck, containing the key
elements needed to persuade a VC, but in the compact and focused form
factor that I've seen achieve the best results.

But first, a word of caution. This deck is intended to be emailed or
handed over to a VC for them to review. This is not a presentation deck,
which should feature far less text and information.

This pitch deck features a fictional startup I created called DoggyHut -
think AirBnB for dog owners. The actual concept of the startup is less
important than the core elements and messages the deck should contain.

The DoggyHut pitch deck is broken down into 11 sections, including the
most important components that should be conveyed to VCs. Note that this
isn't an absolute number, every startup is different.

1. Company purpose - What's your mission? Condense your pitch to a
simple, yet powerful sentence about the purpose of your startup. To help
you in this process, I would refer you to the words of Simon Sinek:
"People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do
simply proves what you believe."

2. Problem - Give a striking overview of the challenges that you address
and solve.

3. Solution - Time to reveal your product. Screenshots preferred.

4. Market - Show that you address an appealing market. You can touch
lightly on the Total Addressable Market, and what percent of that you
believe you can obtain.

5. Why now? - Poor timing is one of the top causes of startup failure.
This makes it critically important for you to explain why the market is
ripe for your startup at this particular moment in time.

6. Competition - A common mistake founders make is claiming that their
company has no competition. There is always competition, direct or
indirect. You need to stress clearly how the competitive landscape is
differentiated and what makes you unique.

7. Revenue model - How will you earn money and who will pay for it? This
doesn't need to be comprehensive at this state, but you need to show
that you've addressed this question.

8. Marketing/sales - The most important thing is to have a clear
go-to-market strategy and a plan for how to acquire users. Demonstrate
that your strategy is KPI driven, and what steps you're taking to
achieve those results.

9. Team - Why is your team the best fit for this startup idea? Show that
you have the relevant experience and skills for this business. If you
have experience in working together, make this explicit.

10. Roadmap - The purpose is to discuss important details of your
startup including: company history and previous funding, evidence of
growth or traction, milestones you hope to achieve with new funding, and
target sum for funding round.

11. Vision - End with the overall vision you have. What is your
long-term goal? In five or 10 years??

The bottom line is this - your deck needs to be a tightly composed and
focused presentation that conveys that key elements of your startup's
story. Don't be afraid to adjust the deck depending on your target
audience and what makes sense for your startup. Your pitch deck is your
foot in the door, and shouldn't be more than that.

It can be hard to hold back, especially if you have a message or
information that is important to you. However, if you put in the hard
work of honing your message to its most important elements, it will help
you understand the core value your startup holds - not just for VCs, but
for your potential users and customers as well.

Elizabeth Holmes convicted of 4 of 11 fraud counts in Theranos trial

January 06 -- Elizabeth Holmes has been found guilty of defrauding
investors as founder and CEO of Theranos. After four months of court
proceedings and seven days of deliberations, the jury has reached a
verdict that will have lasting implications in Silicon Valley and
beyond.

The former youngest and wealthiest female self-made billionaire was
tried for two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts
of wire fraud. Holmes was found guilty of conspiring to defraud
investors, as well as defrauding investors from the DeVos family, hedge
fund manager Brian Grossman and former estate and trust attorney Dan
Mosely. She was not found guilty of charges related to defrauding
patients.

The jury did not reach a verdict on three wire fraud counts involving
Black Diamond executive Chris Lucas, Hall Group executive Bryan Tolbert
and money manager Alan Eisenman, who all testified in the trial. Judge
Edward Davila found a mistrial on these three counts. Prosecutor Jeffrey
Schenk said he will confer with the Department of Justice, then tell the
court next week how the government wishes to proceed.

 

Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 after dropping out of Stanford. She
pitched investors and partners on technology that would revolutionize
the healthcare system - instead of drawing blood intravenously and
waiting days for test results, her technology would prick a tiny bit of
blood and instantly conduct dozens of tests on it. Soon she was the CEO
of a company with a $10 billion valuation, but there was one problem:
the technology didn't work.

Theranos has been defunct since 2018, but Holmes' criminal trial only
began this fall after delays due to the pandemic and the birth of
Holmes' child. Over 11 weeks, the prosecution constructed the case that
Holmes knowingly defrauded investors, questioning witnesses like former
U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, whistleblower Erika Cheung,
Theranos patients, investors, medical professionals and journalists.

Even though Theranos' technology didn't actually accomplish what the
company claimed it did, Holmes said that she thought she was telling the
truth - she even alleged that the slideshows she presented to investors
were made by scientists and engineers. But the prosecution managed on
some counts to convince the jury that Holmes knowingly misled investors
and partners - one piece of evidence showed that Theranos used Pfizer's
logo in an unauthorized manner while negotiating a partnership with
Walgreens. A former senior product manager at Theranos, Daniel Edlin
testified that Theranos sometimes faked demonstrations of their
technology in front of investors. When billionaire investor Rupert
Murdoch had his blood tested, Theranos removed abnormal results before
sending out the reports, Edlin said. 

In a big twist for the high-profile trial, Holmes took the stand herself
to argue that her failure as a startup founder doesn't mean she
committed fraud. In a key moment, Holmes alleged that Theranos COO
Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani abused her.

Balwani, who faces a separate trial next year, was Holmes' boyfriend in
secret. They met when Holmes was 18 and Balwani was 37 - she moved in
with him the year after she dropped out of Stanford. She also said
during the trial that she was raped as a Stanford student, which is part
of why she didn't finish her degree. She "decided [she] was going to
build a life by building this company." She detailed Balwani's
controlling behavior, including a written document that dictated her
daily schedule, including what she ate, when she slept and how she
dressed. She said, "He was so disappointed in my mediocrity and he was
trying to teach me how to be better."

The jury deliberated for seven days, even asking if they were allowed to
take jury instructions home to review. They also asked to re-listen to
some audio clips of Holmes' calls with investors, which had been
presented as evidence, yet deliberations continued into the new year.

On the seventh day of deliberations, the jury submitted its third note
to the judge, saying that it could not reach an unanimous verdict on
three of the 11 counts. The prosecution suggested that Judge Davila read
the jury an instructional document on what to do in the case of a
deadlocked jury. Holmes' defense disagreed, saying that these
instructions could be seen as coercive, but the judge proceeded to
deliver the instructions. He also reminded the jury that Holmes would be
presumed innocent until proven guilty. Four hours later, the jury
submitted another note stating that its members could still not reach an
unanimous verdict on three charges. Shortly after, they presented their
verdict on the eight other counts.

It's not unexpected for the deliberations in a prominent white-collar
trial to take this long. The jury deliberated for five days before
arriving at a verdict in Ghislaine Maxwell's recent four-week trial; she
was found guilty of five of six charges. In 2007, former press tycoon
Conrad Black was of fraud convicted after 12 days of jury deliberations
in a 14-week trial.

The trial's verdict sends a message to tech founders that it's not okay
to lie about your technology - especially not when it affects the health
of real people. But it sends a mixed message that she was found not
guilty of the counts related to defrauding patients. Beyond that, the
case showed how important due diligence is for investors and partners
collaborating with startups. Notably, Theranos' investors weren't the
usual-suspect venture capital firms. Rather, her funding came from
individuals like former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, billionaire
media mogul Rupert Murdoch, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
and the Walton family, among other wealthy elites. Some evidence showed
that these investors were willing to give Theranos money even when
Holmes evaded their more probing questions.

But the investors' misplaced belief in Holmes wasn't the only thing
propelling the faulty Theranos tech forward. Theranos and other
diagnostics companies have exploited regulatory loopholes that allow
devices that are not yet FDA approved to reach the market.

There is not yet a date set for Holmes' sentencing hearing. The
prosecution will not ask Holmes to be detained today, but said that the
government wants either cash or property to secure her bond.

Theranos isn't quite a thing of the past yet. Balwani awaits his own
criminal fraud trial next year.

Presentation

MALVIKA KHAJURIA, MODERATOR, PREMAS BIOTECH: All right. Welcome,
everyone. I am Malvika, the moderator for today's conversation, thank
you so much for joining us today for this nice session from across the
globe.

This is the fifth episode of biotechnology series, an ongoing series of
conversations with experts and leaders in the biotech industry.

Here, our guests share with us there thought [in] leadership, there
insights from their experience so far, their views on how the industry
has evolved over the last few years and their perspectives on emerging
trends and upcoming challenges. The topics for today's conversation is
the journey of oral insulin, the Oramed' story. And on the panel today,
we have Mr. Nadav Kidron, the CEO of Oramed Pharmaceuticals and Dr.
Prabuddha Kundu, who is the Managing Director and Co-Founder at Premas
Biotech.

Before we invite the panelists, I would like the attendees to know that
we will open the session for questions towards the end of the session,
about 20 minutes. As many questions as possible during that next
duration will be taken up. I request you to feel free and keep dropping
your questions in the chat box for us to pick up towards the end of the
conversation and share them with the panelist.

Without further ado, I would now like to invite Dr. Kundu to share his
opening remarks and also welcome our guest speaker for the day.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU, CO-FOUNDER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, PREMAS BIOTECH: Thank
you very much, Malvika. A very warm welcome to you, Nadav. It's amazing
to have you here. So welcome to the first episode of biotechnology.

NADAV KIDRON, CEO, PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN, ORAMED PHARMACEUTICALS: Thank
you, Prabhu. That's always a pleasure to be with you.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Thank you so much. Mr. Nadav Kidron serves as the Chief
Executive Officer and the Director of Oramed Pharmaceuticals, which he
cofounded in 2006. Nadav is an entrepreneur whose experience includes
senior executive roles in a wide range of industries. He cofounded
Entera Bio as a joint venture formed by Oramed and DNA Solutions. He is
a member of the IATI Board and an international lecturer on the Israel's
entrepreneurial culture and the country's roots as an oasis of
innovative ideas. Nadav holds a Bachelor Degree in law and an
international Masters in Business Administration, both from Bar-Ilan
University in Israel.

Nadav is also a fellow of the Merage Business Leadership Program, and a
member of the Israeli Bar Association. He and I have a long Association.
We've known each other for over seven years now, and it's absolutely a
delight to have Nadav on the first of the two parts series on the oral
delivery of protein therapeutics. And we look forward to hearing a lot.
And now that the formal introduction done, Nadav, I really -- I am
excited to hear and engage with you on this wonderful discussion. And
before we start, could I request you to introduce Oramed to our
audience, please.

NADAV KIDRON: Sure, Prabuddha.

Firstly, thank you for having me on. I think this is a very timely
manner to hear about oral insulin and other developments. And as we know
in life, everything is about timing. So I'm happy and it's a pleasure
and a privilege to be here with you.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Thank you.

NADAV KIDRON: Oramed is a company that I co-founded in 2006. What we
have is a technology that allows us to take injection, to take peptide
and deliver them orally.

The first thing that comes to mind when you think about getting rid of
an injection into the patient's compliance. But as I hope that I have an
opportunity to explain down the line, the idea of replacing the
injection. The idea of delivering peptides orally is a major
breakthrough way beyond the patient's compliance. We have now a few
programs in our pipeline. The flagship programs is oral insulin. And
then we have a few other drugs that we're working on in different
clinical developments that we are delivering them orally.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Thank you so much.

It's amazing because we've been discussing oral insulin for decades. But
before I can get there, is there a way we could understand how did you
get involved into Oramed?

NADAV KIDRON: Well, this is actually a funny story. My mother is a
scientist. In all my life, I knew that my mother worked in developing
alternative ways to deliver insulin. As a kid, that's what I knew. And
then about 14, 15 years ago, my mother told me my background is -- I'm a
lawyer, I've an MBA. I'm not coming from the biotechnology arena. My
mother told me listen son, we had a breakthrough that we've made at
Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. And this thing can be a very
needed product for millions of diabetics out there. And obviously,
Hadassah doesn't have the funds to take it into a clinical development.
You want to step in and do something about it. So sort of the
opportunity laid from my mother and I said, sure. And I basically
stopped everything that I did. I took the intellectual property out of
Hadassah, raised the money, establish the company. And here we are 14
years later, a little bit older.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: And wiser. And a fantastic story to come forward.

I mean, one of the questions which I have always wanted to ask you is
all of us who got into biotech went through a sort of iteration thought
process because we were partly from the field, but you are not. So what
was the thought process? Because I think a lot of -- we have young
scientists who are may want to move forward into other areas of work or
people not in science wanting to come and contribute to biotech. So what
was your thought process? How did you process it? I understand the back
story. But firstly, coming from law of finance getting into biotech.

NADAV KIDRON: I think, Prabuddha, you're touching now, an extremely
important point that I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to
understand it because I also lecture a lot also in the Medical School
and some programs in Israel. And what I see is that there is a Chinese
Wall between the science and the business. And if you want to know the
secret, the holy grail of a successful biotechnology venture is to break
the Chinese Wall and to get the science and the business to go hand with
them. That I think is the secret. If you're going to analyze successful
start-ups, versus failures, you'll see that many times the scientists
come with a passion for science, but zero understanding in business and
sometimes vice versa.

The minute we're able to combine the two, we stand a good chance because
--. And maybe I was a little bit naive in the beginning, but the big
pharma out there are not in existence in order to make the world a
better world. They are in existence to get a better return for the
shareholders. That's the way the world works. And in order for us to
bring it technology into maturity, we must make sure that it has the
scientific justification, but it also have to have the right business
strategy to make it happen. And that's why more than I realized my
background as a businessman, along with my mother as a scientist, I
think that was -- if I have to look back and say -- one of the key
factors for success, it was that combination. And I think it's very
important. Anybody who's starting a company, anybody who is involved in
the company to make sure that you've got both brands covered.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: I think personally speaking, I absolutely relate to
that because when you start a company as an entrepreneur, it starts on
an idea, it starts on our technology, but they didn't take that concept
to the field, to the clinics. And then finally, to commercial, you
definitely need not only the sponsor business, also a great team. And I
know you've been able to put a great team together and subsequently down
the line and during our talk, we will touch upon that.

Now coming to the oral delivery of therapeutics, you and I both know,
this has been an area of great pharmaceutical interest. The world needs
it and is absolutely filled with mine fields and failures. So when you
started off, I think it's very important for us all to know what was the
vision that you saw at that time, and it would be very interesting for
us to engage a little bit on that.

NADAV KIDRON: Well, I think at the time I was too naive and
unknowledgeable to know what's ahead of me, that's why I took upon
myself that impossible mission.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: True.

NADAV KIDRON: But seriously I think that one of the advantage in our
fields and there's many disadvantages, but one of the advantages and
maybe the most important advantages that at the end of the day, we are
here to help and to heal people and to make people healthier. And it's
very hard to see it, when you work every day, you negotiate, you deal,
you do the business side. But at the end of the day, we know in the back
of our mind, it's not like a real estate deal that it moves one to
another. Here, our vision at Oramed is to bring an oral insulin that can
make people in the better, healthier status.

And that's a key thing to understand. The bottleneck, the problem is
when you look at that field of developing a drug, is that you have a
real Via Dolorosa that takes tremendous amount of time and huge amounts
of money. We're talking about 17 years in average to develop a drug. 17
years, okay? We're talking about almost if you take into consideration
the failures, you're talking about almost $1 billion to develop a drug.
We're talking about a lot of money.

And I think the biggest challenge in this industry versus high-tech and
other things that at the end of the day, you're fully depended on a
third party, which is not in your control, meaning, let's say you go in
there under the FDA of your in India, whatever it is the regulator, you
can do whatever you want to do. But at the end of the day, there's
someone else that will tell you -- this is okay, this is what I want
from you. Whether you think it's justified or not, you're totally in
their hands. And I think that's the biggest challenge that we have in
this industry.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Picking that up, Nadav, we all know and I just spoke
about a little that how difficult oral delivery of proteins is and
especially oral insulin. Oral insulin has been a beacon. So it would be
wonderful, if you could just touch upon a little bit for our audience
here, the live audience is the technology. Before we get into the
commercial development and some of the discussions that you had with
your investors, it would be very interesting if you could just peal a
little bit about the technology that you have.

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. So here is where do have to go a little bit more on
the biology side, but I'm going to keep it simple. When we talk about
oral insulin, we're talking about a technology that you swallow a
capsule, it goes through your body and then it goes from the intestine
into the portal vein and it basically gets into the liver. Now you have
to understand that when you give an injection, then the insulin goes
directly into the bloodstream. Now allow me to be a little bit blunt,
and allow you to share what is the crazy thing that's going on today in
the way we treat diabetics. What happens is a diabetic is someone who's
got a lot of glucose in the blood. What do we do, we give them insulin.
The insulin takes away the glucose from the blood. So suddenly we have a
lower level of glucose that caused the person to be hungry.

So they end up eating more and then they get more glucose in their blood
and then we need to go back to the insulin. So we are putting up the
patients in a vicious circle that the insulin or I'll say differently,
the diabetics who basically suffering from obesity and overweight, we
treat them with an insulin that causes them to be obese and overweight,
which is a crazy thing. And the idea of the oral insulin is to break
that vicious circle. And because we're able to deliver it into the
liver, portal versus the injection that changes out everything. And the
reason is that the liver is the organ that regulates the secretions of
the insulin into the body.

And we're giving the body the real physiological control over the way
things work. And then with a little bit of insulin, we can actually make
sure that there's less production of glucose by the liver and we can end
up lowering the amount of glucose without all the damages that we have
with the alternative way. That's why oral insulin is a major
breakthrough that offers a new paradigm of treatment for the hundreds of
millions of diabetics out there in the world.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: And I absolutely believe that because I have been privy
to some of the data and I think that -- and you've also -- Oramed has
taken the liberty and the forward step of publishing a lot of the data,
and papers, and in the association as posters, I think it's amazing. But
if I could just take you back to your 2006 and 2007, what was it that
when you spoke to investors, what made them gave? I know you're a very
smart man, you're based in Israel, which is the fountain head of
Innovation. But what were the first couple of things that you sort of
faced? It would be wonderful if we could know what you told them and b,
what their feedback was initially. Because it would be helpful for some
of the new thought processes and entrepreneurs are going to now a days.

NADAV KIDRON: So I think when we started the company in 2006, it was
very earlier on and there was a very, very little proof of concept. And
I think what's helped us attract investors were two things. I think one
thing, it's been my mother's work, and I think her passion was something
that the investor saw. And they saw someone with tremendous experience
and knowledge in this specific field. And that means being a
professional. If someone a company says I know this field and not that
you said it but people know that she is one of the leaders in the world
when it comes to alternative delivery of insulin, I think that's a major
point because, you know, the guy that professional.

And the second thing, I think in our case, the need was very obvious. So
the combination of our professional team plus the unmet need, I think,
allowed us to get the investors and to start hitting this road.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Fantastic. No, sometimes I think you're -- down the
talk, I will also give a personal experience that I've had with your
mother in terms of how we got started, but I will slowly come into that.
I think that also is a fascinating story.

Now that you're entering. I mean, you've gone through the stages of
preclinical, Phase 1, Phase two. And now as you entering the Phase 3, I
think it will be of immense interest to our audience because is it --
how are you looking forward to the Phase 3, Nadav? Are you looking at
just Type 2 or you're mixing Type 1? What is the sort of cohorts that
you -- if you could share with us. I think it would be wonderful for our
audience to hear you and hear your thoughts on that.

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. So maybe just I'll start if you don't mind because
what I saw and it's quite a lot of people here, so not everybody, even
know what's Type 1 and Type 2. So I'll just use two sentences on that,
so everybody is on the same thing. So Type 1 make about 5% to 10% of the
total diabetics population. And those are people who usually get it at
an earlier age. And those are people that their pancreas is unable to
produce any insulin and they're totally dependent on insulin. The
majority of the diabetics are the Type 2 people who get it later on
because one of the two are combination of an insulin resistance or
they're enabled produce enough insulin. And unfortunately, it's a
progressive disease. So we going to see that the ability to produce
insulin going down with time. They start with different medications,
diet and exercise, take different medications. And eventually they also
become insulin dependent patients at the end of the day.

When we talk about oral insulin, and this is something very interesting.
We've ran a meeting of our scientific advisory boards, and like you
mentioned before, I'm a firm believer that any business, the most
important asset that you have is actually your -- the people. And maybe
I'll quote, I heard in the name of Warren Buffett. I don't know if it's
true or not, but he said if you have three things: technology, money and
management and you have to give up on one thing, he said you should give
up on the technology. Because with money and management, we can get
anything done. So people is really everything. So when we had the
meeting of really the top guys in the world, and we showed them the
profile of the oral insulin and we asked them sincerely who do you think
that will be a good fit for?

So the answer, the bottom-line answer was for everybody. Now, in the
real world, it doesn't work that way because you have payers and only
going to be willing to pay for a certain patient. And you have a lot of
other things. But if I look purely scientifically Type 1 and Type 2
should be get into oral insulin. In practicality, we are about to start
now a Phase 3 in the United States under the FDA. This trial will be
done only on Type 2.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Okay.

NADAV KIDRON: But we have shown and potentially we will pursue also the
indication for Type 1.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Fantastic. Well, thank you so much. I think it's been
amazing to hear this progress. But now coming -- just rolling back a
little it's been a long time in development and you said that you've had
a lot of success. I would also like to touch upon what were your key
bottlenecks when you started out with this technology and how have you
progressed with it and what are the sort of steps that you took to take
care of some of them, like scale up and how is this going to become
available widely, if you could touch on some of those bottlenecks, it
would be wonderful, Nadav.

NADAV KIDRON: So I'll touch on bottlenecks. I think one of the key
challenges in any business has to do with communication, making sure
that everybody understands each other, especially when you're talking
about different countries. I'll just tell you a quick joke, to show
about communication. People understand the same thing. So Gary recently
went into a taxi and he put the alco-gel on his hands. And he said to
the tax driver listen, I apologize. There's a little bit of a bad smell
freight. So the taxi driver said, don't worry about it, I hadn't been
smelling for the last few days anyways.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: (Laugh).

NADAV KIDRON: So you really want to make sure that both sides everybody
understand things in the same way. When we go into a Phase 3, there's a
few challenges. Firstly, I want to make sure that you have the package,
which is ready for the FDA that the FDA say I'm satisfied with it and
you can move forward and that's a huge mission. That's number one.

Secondly, you have to make sure that you're going to have the best
partner to run actual clinical trials. We don't do it as a company. We
had a third-party service provider, but they run it. We're talking about
dozens and dozens of sites. The third thing is logistically, it's
extremely complicated. And unfortunately now in days of corona, just
sending materials from one place from another, we get some of it done in
India. We get some of it done in Europe. You have to send it to the
United States and all of that. So that has been a huge challenge in
these days during the corona. And the problem is that it's one big
domino. If one thing is going up, the whole thing is moving around
accordingly. That's why it's extremely challenging business to manage.
And as I said, it goes back to having the best people who can do it. So
you can hopefully anything that comes up your way, any hiccup, you know
how to deal with it.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Fantastic. Well it's lovely.

So coming back to this whole thing of team, I know you have an extremely
well-know team and it's extremely important for people out there to know
that you have kept the team together for these number -- over a decade.
And you practically operate as a virtual company. I think it's important
for you to touch upon that and how well you have managed to do that
running international clinical trials and so on and so forth.

NADAV KIDRON: So there's a few ways of how to build the company. I
personally felt that there is an advantage by using as much as possible
outside vendors versus building a big team. Everything has advantages
and disadvantages. But in this business, it goes ups and downs as far as
different tasks that you have to do. And when you have an outside
vendors, you're able to get someone that has terrific, terrific
experience, but you also able to manage it in a way that whether you
have the highs or the downs as far as how busy it is, you're going to
get the service. And I believe that at the end of the day, it cost you
less and it allows you to have a much smoother way of managing things.
From what I hear and from what I read, this approach is becoming now
more and more popular. And I see many more companies now who are keeping
a very thin structure, which allows them to use third party vendors and
allows them to get things done in a smoother way too many -- to a
certain extent.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Fantastic. No, I mean, coming to this point of valuable
partnerships at a global level, I think there have been many times
you've actually spanned from all the way from the United States, China,
India going into Europe, it's been phenomenal watching from the
sidelines how you've built this entire supply chain up. So if there were
one or two advices, you'd like to give the young professionals who are
on the call, what would it be, that when they're trying to build some
valuable partnerships across the globe?

NADAV KIDRON: I think it's very important, if you want to talk about the
deals that we've done in China, it's a very different mentality. And
when we grow up, everybody grows up in a certain environment and we're
very used for the way things are and we take it for granted. It's very
hard for anybody. Doesn't make a difference, how old you are how much
experience you have, is to understand that the someone across the table,
things that you think are obvious and you take for granted are actually
totally not. So I think the idea that you opened yourself up, to come
and to trust people and to try and listen and to make sure you
understand, it really the bottom line is communication. If you
communicate and people feel that you are honest and frank with them,
then I think that's already 70% of it. And then if you have the right
team on board that they actually execute, then you should be good.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Absolutely. I think communication is key. And the way
you transparently run the business, and you ask, and you get, and you
deal with your partners, I think is very, very important. It gives them
both a comfort. And you're right. I think the hub-and-spoke model of
partnership is becoming very, very popular in the world. And coming to
this, this is a time I think I should let the audience also in on what
you and I were speaking a little earlier is how did we get into this
game.

It was 2013, and we were attending the bio. And it just so happened that
your mother Dr. Miriam Kidron just walk by me and my colleague Nupur.
We're at the booth. And it so happened that she'd had not even intended
to meet with us. And the person she had sort of wanted to meet was not
there. So she looked at us and said, can I sit down. And we said, of
course, you're waiting for someone? And we were so fortunate that she
turned around and said, what do you guys do. We said we make protein.
And she said, I need a few and who knew that seven or eight years later,
we will be discussing this a long journey in helping oral insulin come
to fruition. It's been amazing. So to all your --.

NADAV KIDRON: See, Prabu, I think what you're saying is and maybe I
didn't say that that but you also need to have faith?

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Yes.

NADAV KIDRON: Because any business school they would have gone to, they
would never teach you that I'd just offer a chair to a lady and they may
become one of your largest clients, right? So if you have faith, if you
believe that things will turn out to be good, that's probably the most
important thing out there.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Absolutely. I think it's belief, communication and
transparency that builds global networks and partnerships that really
--. Because what you're doing is you're taking the good of humanity and
synthesizing together. I mean, oral insulin or oral delivery of proteins
is never easy. However, I guess it's the synthesis of good partnerships
that's really got you there.

Now, transiting a little, Nadav, looking a little bit towards slightly
towards the future and looking at the various modalities, you did
mention that there were a few other therapeutic areas beyond insulin
that you're starting to explore, it would be important to understand how
do you see this technology transitioning oral insulin into commercial?
So what do you see for other territories? And then I'll have a follow-up
question on the other modalities.

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. So we are now at probably the most interesting point
that we could have imagined and that is that we plan probably in a month
from now to already have the first patient enrolled in a Phase 3. Now
for those who are not familiar enough with the field, getting the FDA
and starting a Phase 3 in the United States, it's a big deal.

Now the reason this is so interesting also in our case is because we've
already shown that oral insulin is safe, and we've already shown that
oral insulin works. And in this trial, which is relatively not a huge
trial, we're talking about 1,500 people divided into two trials. But the
first trial after six months of dosing, so we have to recruit the
patients. And then once the last patient you get six months of dosing
and then we open the data. So we are going to see the data in a year in
a change. And that makes it into a very, very interesting point in
development because I think people understand the need for the oral
insulin.

I will just add one more thing about the need. Many times when you have
an entrepreneur many times when we come up with the product, you may
fall in love with your own idea and you think, oh, my God, this is the
best ideas. No, funny enough, a lot of the most successful ventures that
were never -- were not able to raise money. When the Google guys started
than they spoke about the search engine, nobody thought. Same with Mark
Zuckerberg with Facebook, some of the VC through them down, what's the
big deal to do a Facebook, whatever it is.

But one of the biggest question is if there is a need to it? What we've
done, which I think was a very interesting exercise for us, we hired a
research team and totally independent work done by them and they
interviewed about 100 patients, doctors, payers, and they asked them.
Here's the story of oral insulin. They didn't even mention the name of
the company. How likely are you to use it, how likely are you to
recommend to your patients and so on, and so forth. And this exercise
taught us a tremendous amount how much oral insulin is needed. In a way
that even us as the founders and the people who did all oral insulin, I
think we didn't realize until we actually saw these interviews with
dozens of people who were saying that what we have today, we have side
effects.

You could come up with something which has basically zero side effect.
It's easy to take and it's clinically relevant. It's a huge thing. And
right now, we're seeing some interest from different companies in
different territories around the world, about partnering up with us and
taking it into their perspective territories and I think over the next
few months as we move forward and as we get to get closer to get the
results out, I really hope that we'll be able to share news about other
partners who will be going in with us on the Oral insulin.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: It's a phenomenal journey. Now, looking at my second
part of the question is what are the other modalities that you are
looking at. We obviously would look at expansion of this portfolio
beyond oral insulin. And so what are the other modalities that you would
be very, very interested in, to take forward.

NADAV KIDRON: So I have to throw right away and Prabuddha, we -- I'll
say I'll throw it right away because everybody asked me about it and I
put it out there. Everybody asks me will your technology work for a
COVID 19 vaccine? And the answer is that we believe that as long as the
vaccine is not an [RNA] vaccine, but it's a protein-based vaccine, we
should be able to deliver it orally. The only thing I'll say further
than that is that we are looking into it and as soon as we have updates
or things to share, we'll share it in the right proper way as every
public company does. So that's number one. I had to put it out there
because that's the most popular question. So it out there, we put it out
there.

Besides oral insulin and besides COVID-19, we believe --. And I'll just
explain one more thing about the COVID-19 because it's important to
understand. The idea of vaccinating the population of the world, we're
talking about 8 billion people and probably different countries will
have their vaccines first or whatever. Because the big challenge with
the COVID-19 vaccine is the production. And you need to produce it very,
very fast. The challenge is that there's a certain part of the
population that will have a hard time with the injection. No, there's
going to be very old people that they wouldn't want to go next to the
place where you get to the injection and doesn't it make sense to send
somebody to their house.

So if you can offer a certain segment of the population, something that
you can actually go to this person's house and just take it orally or
some people say, what, I rather pay, whatever $20 and not stand in line
to get it there. So there's going to be a certain percentage of the
population that whatever the winner vaccine is going to be, they would
need and they would want to use an oral version that. So that COVID-19.
We cannot have any discussion with data, but anything without putting at
least two, three minutes mentioning the world's corona, we've done it.
We check the box.

We working on a few other things. We're working on a drug called GLP-1
analogue, which is a very potent drug, giving to diabetics. And we are
in mid advanced clinical studies with that. We're also working on
something called leptin. Leptin is a hormone that has amazing job. And
once we eat our food, it sent the message to the brain that we eat
enough and we suppose to start eating. I don't know about you, but for
me, it doesn't always work that way. But the idea if we can actually
deliver the leptin orally. So there are receptors in the gut, so using
Oramed's technology, we can get the leptin right into the receptors and
then it goes directly into the brain, the brain tell you, Mr. you had
enough you don't need this desert, stop there and hopefully you eat
less.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Yes.

NADAV KIDRON: And the other thing I would just mention about the oral
insulin, which is very interesting is that throughout the trial -- the
extra trial that we did, we able to show and that makes a lot of sense
because it's all part of the metabolic syndrome that the oral insulin
actually works for NASH fatty liver, which is, I don't think we have the
time, but that's a very interesting topic because that's one probably of
the most common diseases out there that we don't have any good therapy
right now, but everybody understands the need and it seems to be that
oral insulin will be a very good and elegant solution for that as well.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Fantastic. No, I mean, it's amazing to hear that how
the expansion of this platform is happening and so on and so forth. And
how obviously, as you said with COVID-19 and I'm sure there'll be lots
of questions coming to both you and me in terms of -- because on one
hand, you have oral insulin or oral therapy, and we are working and
COVID-19. I'm sure there'll be questions coming in, is there a potential
working together relationship. But before I get there, Nadav, just to
quickly come to a conclusion because I think we have a lot of people on
the call as the audience, and I'm sure there are a lot of questions for
you as well as some for me. What is the vision for your company going
forward? You've talked about the extension, we've talked about the other
modalities. What do you see we've heard from your division, which you
started with, in 2006? What's the vision going forward?

NADAV KIDRON: We have a platform that I remember, but 10 years ago we
spoke to a professional company and they said how come we're not working
on 50 different drugs. They said, you said you have something amazing.
You showed that your platform works period. And there's a huge need for
proven. So in real life, sometimes you have limitations. And the ability
for us to work on 50 drugs at the same time are obvious. But I think
down the line, we want to use that platform because we are able to show
that it's a very good platform and to use it for many other drugs. And
ideally you want to start with drugs that are not only there just
because of the patient's compliance, but through this different way of
delivering, we can offer a better therapeutical solution.

And at the end of the day, what we want to do is, we want to be a part
of -- we have an expression in Hebrew called Tikkun Olam, creating a
better world. And we believe that money is important, but health and
doing goods are the most important things. And we're very privileged to
be working in the field that we have the mission, and we can work hard
on potentially helping hundreds of millions of people to be healthier,
to feel better and to really be part of a better world out there.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: With that thank you so much, Nadav. I mean, one last
question, which I always feel that young entrepreneurs in the audience
should know is if there are three quick lessons coming from Nadav
Kidron's book of management or book of life, what would be the three
quick lessons or words, what would those be? and Over to you Nadav.

NADAV KIDRON: So the first one is, like I said, if -- it when I started
the company, I would have known what's coming my way. I'm not sure I
would have done it. So, anybody is skeptical, tells you it's not going
to work whatever, don't give up. But on the other hand, don't be stupid.
Don't go all the way through in something that doesn't make sense. You
want to make sure that you have the system in place that when you choose
your goal, when you choose your business, choosing it right is extremely
important. So make sure, you don't take the no's, you don't take the
yes, you really have to feel you have your own conviction. You have to
believe in it. Only then it's going to work. That's the first thing.

Second thing, again, we said and I don't need to repeat people
management, make sure you have people, you can trust, good people to
work with. That's the first thing -- the second thing. And the third
thing, I'm actually going to change from what it was going to say, and
I'll say faith. You have to faith because it's difficult out there. And
unless you're going to have the drive, unless you're going to have the
vision, unless you're going to believe in yourself, when I read the
biographies of every real big, successful entrepreneur, there's so many
faith points along the way that they probably should have given up. But
if you have to drive, if you have faith, if you believe in it and you
keep on pushing, I believe and you should believe that eventually you're
going to win it.

I think that's a perfect note to pause our discussion. You and I you
know, we can discuss this to the end of the day, but I can see that a
lot of questions have come in. So with that, thank you so much, Nadav.
It was amazing to speak with you and get across your thoughts. So thank
you so much and deeply grateful for your time and your friendship and
your partnership. So Malvika with that, could we open the discussion and
the floor to some of the questions that maybe there?

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Yes.

NADAV KIDRON: Prabuddha, maybe I'd just say one more thing. So just that
you mentioned that we've been working together, and I just wanted to say
that it's not often, Prabuddha, that you're able to work with a partner
and really become friends. And that has to be when there's a tremendous
amount of trust. And I think the best lesson that I could show anybody
is the relationship that we have built through business to become both
friends and really trusting partners. To the extent that, I don't need a
contract, I don't need anything. If I have the award, I know I'm there.
So I'm very privileged, Prabuddha, to everyone pretty much as partners,
and I'm very thankful for you offering the chair to my mother back then,
which allows us to be here today.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Absolutely. No, I -- it warms the heart, Nadav. Thank
you so much. Thank you. And, Malvika, over to you.

Questions and Answers

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Thank you, Mr. Kidron and Dr. Kundu for such an
insightful session. You are absolutely right, we in fact have a lot of
questions that have lined. The first question is from [Aneesh Vijaykar],
who ask, do any of your product developments include oral insulin for
Type A. diabetes or is it only for Type 2 diabetics?

If yes, what stage of development is this product? I have 12 year old
son, who is Type 1.

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. So I can tell you that we get a lot of e-mails and
messages from parents to Type 1 that are eager to find a solution and a
replacement to the.

Can you hear me, okay?

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Yes.

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. Eager to find a replacement to the injection and the
pump and all of that. So currently, our Phase 3, as I mentioned, is
moving on with the Type 2, but we have done the work with the Type 1,
and we can potentially move into a Phase 3 with the Type 1, which we
intend to do down the line. And I think it's something that will help
the Type 1, not just to deliver them the insulin because they will still
need the pump to a certain extent, but their liver is deprived from
insulin. And by us, giving deliver right away, it will help us to put
them in a much stable, more stable status and eliminate a lot of the
extreme events that some of the Type 1 are experiencing. And I can tell
you when we've done trials in Type 1s, one of the things that made it
very difficult for us is the Type 1 we did once the trail on retail
diabetes, which type of ones that have a lots of the extreme events of
hyper and hypo.

And the patients at the end of the trial is said, can we please keep on
taking the oral insulin. We took it four months. If I remember correctly
it said, can we please take it longer? And we said we wish we could give
it to you, but we have to work with the protocols. And that goes to the
frustration that you have a great product and it's safe and people want
to use it. But we have to go through the FDA route and it takes a lot of
time. So the solution is there, is waiting to be there. It's going to
take some more time and then many more people will be able to use it.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Absolutely. Thank you. The second --.

NADAV KIDRON: Maybe just to make things just a little bit easier because
I see there's a lot of questions. And I know, we're limited -- a little
bit limited in time, so maybe if you want to do a few questions
together, and I'm trying to answer in a little bit of faster way.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Alright. So this question is from [Dishta Datke], who
says is your team also working on delivering monoclonal antibodies
orally?

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. So we mentioned we mentioned the idea of the COVID
vaccine and as I mentioned, once we have more information, we will share
it in the appropriate way.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: This one's from [Tracy Hobgood]. She says, good
morning all, why is it that the FDA can fast-track other medicines, but
with one as important as Oramed, it's taking so much longer to get
approval?

NADAV KIDRON: So the real answer is that we are not fast-track, but
we're not doing the regular track as well. The FDA acknowledges that
insulin is the drug that has been out there, and it's been used for
many, many years, almost 100 years. And therefore, what they're asking
from us, it's not the same as the new chemical entity. So we have a
fast-track, not as fast as we would have liked, but it is getting to the
market faster than it would have been in new chemical entity. So that's
definitely. And I wanted to say, and you know what, when it's [viewed
due], I want to say a word of compliment to the FDA with our recent work
with them that response time has been very fast, very professional. It
seems that they are eager just as much as we are to get this product out
there. And it's a pleasure to work when we have a third party that
really wants you to get it out there into the market?

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Alright. I know that you mentioned for me take them up
in a bunch, but I think it will be better the way I've listed them to go
one by one, but I'll be super quick with it. The next question is from
[Robert LeBoyer]. He says oral insulin has been attempted before, what
is the difference between Oramed's drug and other previous attempts?

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. So the answer has a few folds. Number one,
obviously, that technology evolves and things that we've tried years
ago, we came up with the more advanced technology that obviously works
better. And the other thing has to do with the indication. Like I
mentioned, we really focus on the idea that we deliver it to the liver
and maybe for a split of a second, I saw the question that came up about
cost of goods and amounts. So let me just already answer that because
it's all related to charter. The idea of the port of delivery is that we
actually getting insulin that signals to the liver.

Because how does deliver know when to put the glucose and when to put
insulin into the bloodstream. There's a signaling. If I'm getting
insulin into the liver so I'm sending a message to deliver, listen you
have too much glucose. And then the lever shuts up the excessive
production of glucose by the liver. And that allows you to use a small
amount of insulin as we actually showed in our Phase IIb. You see that
small amounts of insulin can get even better results than larger amount
of insulin because of the signaling system. And we -- what we're doing
and/or maybe is we totally leveraging the idea of that into the
technology, which is different than what some of the other companies try
to do, which was just a 100% replacement to the injection, which is not
our indication. So again, I've moved that a little bit of a faster pace,
but I hope it's clear enough.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Thank you, Nadav.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Thank you. This question is from [Viresh Sheth] who
says what are the challenges in oral delivery of therapeutic proteins,
especially in terms scaling it up.

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. The challenge is that -- the first challenge is that
you have the problem of the degradation and because of the molecular
size, it's impossible to -- for it to get into the bloodstream. Scaling
it up -- one of the biggest challenges what we have has to do with big
part of our technology, which is an adjuvant called SBTI, which is a
protease inhibitor. And thankfully, our partner to that is Premas. So
when it goes to scaling up, we're in very good hands because we know we
can rely on Premas on making sure that we can scale it up and be ready
for the market with relatively low cost of goods and the ability to
produce it on the high level.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: This is from [Teresa Okea]. She says, is oral insulin
stable at ambient temperature or does it need to be refrigerated?

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. So there's a formal answer and the informal answer.
What I can tell you the informal answer, we saw that it is stable
without being refrigerated. For the label and our stability data, I have
to remember exactly how we did it, I think we probably recommend for it
to be refrigerated. But I think we're going to show on further stability
studies that huge advantage over the injection should be that you can
actually keep it to our room temperature. For how long and all of that,
we have to see the exact stability data.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Correct. [Gautam Das] ask when you say zero side
effects, are you suggesting that it doesn't induce any hypoglycemia when
overdosed?

NADAV KIDRON: Yes, because the liver is the organ that can take
basically 80% of the body's insulin is being stored in the liver. In the
year 2000, there was -- a trial was made in Russia by a scientist named
[Shishko] that he put a catheter of insulin into the liver. And one of
the things that you saw is that you can put so much insulin into the
liver and the liver stops it. It doesn't get into the bloodstream. So
that's why that's the basic advantage over the oral delivery is that
this is the safest way to deliver insulin because if it as an injection,
you give a little bit more -- you're going to get it. But if you give it
to the liver, you can give so much more and there's going to be zero
side effect. Absolutely. And no other side effects as well. It's almost
like taking a glass of -- this is sparkling water, almost the same
thing.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: All right. The next question is what are the time line
you see in the oral insulin journey, the next (multiple speakers)?

NADAV KIDRON: So, the most important thing is that I hope in a month
from now, so we will get the first patient in the first trial of the two
trials of the Phase 3. And it should take us up to six months to recruit
all the patients. And then once the last patient is in, six months after
we got those, we're going to open up the results. And that's going to be
the biggest drama, because that's going to be a readout on the Phase 3,
we're going to see --. And again, I'm not a prophet, but I assume we're
going to see, there's no issue of safety. Because I mentioned to you the
way it works, there shouldn't be any issue of safety.

And we're going to see the exact level of efficacy, which again, my
guess would be that giving it for six months versus three months of the
Phase IIb, we should even see a higher level of efficacy, but that yet
to be seen. So in a year and change the biggest drama will happen as
we're going to unfold the results of the first trial of the Phase 3. And
that point, just to make it clear, we know where we are. So we know
what's going to happen on the second trial. We know the timeline. We
know the exact demand. We know everything. We know the dosing. We know
the cost of goods. So that point is going to be the biggest drama in the
world that insulin and it's probably going to be a little bit before 100
years from the time the insulin was invented that the biggest
[turnaround] will come again.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Amazing. Thank you.

This is not an anonymous line. Can you control insulin resistance with
this technology?

NADAV KIDRON: We control insulin resistant is a difficult way of saying
it, but I believe that when we give it orally you are literally doing a
bypass because again, like I mentioned, you're doing the whole thing
with the liver. So that's why it's a little bit different than what we
said about the injection.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Alright. [Devraj Lakhan Singh] ask is their response
time benefit or not with your oral insulin product.

NADAV KIDRON: So the timing and that's one of the biggest differences
between us and the injection unless the injection, which is immediate
when we give it orally because it's encapsulated. It takes about 60 to
75 minutes until it reaches the bloodstream. So it's very, very
different as far as the injection and there is a little bit more of a
wait time until it gets into the actual bloodstream. But the effect to
the liver is happening earlier on.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Right. [Claus Foscreen] ask when we expect the BLA to
be approved for ORMD-0801.

NADAV KIDRON: So the way it works is we need to run the first trial of
the Phase 3, we're going to get the result of that. We're going to get
the results of the second trial of the Phase 3. Then we have to submit
the BLA. We're talking about a year altogether of all of that as well.
And then in the United States, we're talking about 2024 for it to be
approved and to go into the market.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Okay. This question is to P. K. Prabuddha, how are you
scaling up and how do you control COGs as Nadav's sales?

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: That's a interesting question. So a couple of things
without giving away too much is, about seven years ago, we analyzed the
process and found it to be a large number of steps. So against that we
put on the ground is which of those steps can be scaled up easily and
which couldn't. So very early on in the process before the clinical
trial started, in all seriousness, we got into it and we analyzed and in
certain cases where they were 14 steps, we brought it down to six. We
replaced certain material, which was easily available and could be
scaled up very easily. So we've now gone beyond and we are able to make
a number of kgs per week, which translates into a fairly scalable
process. And once you are able to scale up on a sustainable process that
brings down the cost of goods.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Alright. This one says, will the regulations of oral
solid medications be still applicable to oral delivery of therapeutic
proteins or just like biosimilars when new guidelines and regulations
have to be required. [Sure].

NADAV KIDRON: I'm not sure I fully understand the questions, but we
aren't there -- we were just switched because of the due date of when
this drug will be out there. When we switch into the BLA, Biologics. And
therefore, we are 100% under Biologics, which is one huge advantage that
many times goes unnoticed. And that is that from the time the drug is
registered with the FDA, we're getting 12 years of exclusivity
regardless of the patents. No one else can sell oral insulin in the
United States for 12 years, which is quite a big deal that we get with
the Biologics [drugs].

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Correct. This one from [Zeeshan Fatima] who asked will
this be going will this the active form or will it be pre-pro? Are you
going to do testing for gestational diabetes as well?

NADAV KIDRON: So right now we are looking into the Type 2 and then
potentially the Type 1. I'm not sure I understood the first question,
but since you have a lot of questions, so, I think let's keep it
rolling.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Okay. Well I have more here. How much time does the
oral insulin intake to get released into the blood? And how much time is
it is expected to be taken in a day, what would the dosages be like?

NADAV KIDRON: So the answer the first part, the answer the second one,
ideally, we would like for it to be once a day. What we saw in the Phase
IIb that once a day, twice a day basically gave us the same results.
Maybe a little bit in the beginning, twice-a-day was a little bit
better, but at the end of the day, after 90 days, once a day was the
same. The ideal thing from cost of goods and compliance would be to give
as least insulin as possible, and once a day. Anything more than once a
day, is just patients compliant. It's more complicated. So we could be
in a scenario that even twice a day can be a little bit better. But
we're still going to choose the once a day if it's good enough because
from the patients compliance point of view, it's much more attractive.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Awesome. So, Charita ask, would you be commenting on
any observed adverse effect in the clinical trials? Is anyone following
or doing a subgroup analysis on the data to observe whether the oral
delivery is helping other ailments under the umbrella of metabolic
disorders.

NADAV KIDRON: Okay. So, we have to -- if there's something huge, we
obviously we have to report and then there could be a potentially -- it
happens to a company that potentially can be a clinical [board] if it's
related. Other than that, it's not very big adverse events. We are only
going to report at the end of the day. It could be that I'll be able to
share with other folks like that whatever has to do with the trials so
far, we've got a 400 patients and it seems to be okay, things like that
we will be able to communicate.

As far as the other thing yes, we definitely trying to take advantage of
this trial, and we're trying to look at almost every measurement that
makes sense. We want to show time in range. We want to show -- anything
that we can show we want to take advantage because we're already putting
all the money and all the effort and like we spoke about the metabolic
syndrome. So we have a list of things that we want to show improvement
on. And I firmly believe that we may be surprised to the better and to
see that oral insulin helps with other things as well, again, because of
the special and unique physiological way of delivery.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: I think, Malvika, we are approaching very close to the
ending of the call.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Yeah. We have got two minutes.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Yes, we've got about two minutes and I've got a couple
of questions which have come to me personally. So if I can relay that
some to you, Nadav, that I'm going to read out.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Absolutely.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: One comes from [Lucas Huntimer], have you explored the
application and markets for animal health and pet, particularly dogs and
cats that are prone to diabetes. It comes from Lucas.

NADAV KIDRON: So the answer is that we feel that this could be very
relevant. It's a growing market. There's a lot of people who have pets
and they will invest the world in their pet. We had some previous
discussions. And I think it's something that actually we need now that
we're going to be undergoing the Phase 3 to pick it up and examine it
even more. So the answer is we've done a little bit and we should do a
little bit more.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Fantastic. Then I have one more he say, will it be
easier for you to pass the trial in China than any other geography?

NADAV KIDRON: So as far as what's going on in China we're being fed
information from our partners and the way they describe it is it sounds
that the trial in China will be faster. The basically started the Phase
3 and it looks that they will get into the market in China way before
we'll be able to get in the United States. It's a totally different way
of thinking as far as the Chinese FDA and they have done a tremendous
amount of work and a well-done work that allows them to initiate the
Phase 3. And it should get into the market as I said, earlier on. And
obviously, once it gets into the Chinese market Oramed is entitled to
get 10% royalties from the net sales of the Chinese partner.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Thank you. And other five or six questions that were
directed have already been answered by Nadav. So Malvika over to you.

MALVIKA KHAJURIA: Yeah. I think we actually on time now, and I know that
there are a lot of questions that we won't be able to take up because of
the lack of time. But we do have email addresses and the team will send
an e-mail to answer some of those questions. So the attendees can rest
assured that your questions will be answered post the conversation is
over. Thank you so much to the panelists for your valuable insights and
the interaction. And obviously, thanks ado to the attendees for such
great questions and for participating. I would now just like to invite
Dr. Kundu to give us his concluding remarks and close today's session.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Thank you very much, Malvika. Nadav, as always, very
grateful to you for your wonderful talk, discussions and the session. I
think it has been very, very eliminating. I learned a lot as well. And
thank you so much. It's been wonderful. And to everyone else, this
concludes the part one of the oral technology series, the part two will
be on November 18, where Dr. Miriam Kidron and other panelists as well.

So with that, Nadav, thank you so much.

NADAV KIDRON: Thank you very much Prabuddha. It was nice and fun and
always good to connect. Thank you very much.

PRABUDDHA KUNDU: Thank you. Bye-bye.

And to the audience, thank you so much for coming on. We had a large
number of people in, Nadav, so I'm sure this is going to just start the
initial interest for many of them. So look forward to everyone on
November 18, again. Thank you so much and very good morning to you,
Nadav. And goodbye to everyone else.

NADAV KIDRON: Thanks.

United Kingdom : Avos Locker remotely accesses boxes, even running in
Safe Mode

Over the past few weeks, an up-and-coming ransomware family that calls
itself Avos Locker has been ramping up attacks while making significant
effort to disable endpoint security products on the systems they target.

In a recent series of ransomware incidents involving this ransomware,
Sophos Rapid Response discovered that the attackers had booted their
target computers into Safe Mode to execute the ransomware, as the
operators of the now-defunct Snatch, REvil, and BlackMatter ransomware
families had done in attacks weve documented here.

The reason for this is that many, if not most, endpoint security
products do not run in Safe Mode a special diagnostic configuration in
which Windows disables most third-party drivers and software, and can
render otherwise protected machines unsafe.

Not your grandfathers ransomware

Avos in Portuguese translates to the word grandfather but this is no
ransomware for old men.

The Avos Locker attackers were not only rebooting the machines into Safe
Mode for the final stages of the attack; They also modified the Safe
Mode boot configuration so they could install and use the commercial IT
management tool AnyDesk while the Windows computers were still running
in Safe Mode. Normally, third party software would be disabled on a
computer that had been rebooted into Safe Mode, but these attackers
clearly intended to continue to remotely access and control the targeted
machines unimpeded.

Avos Locker deployment tools were stored in a backup server under a
directory named a. Attackers run the files remotely, so theyre never
written to the filesystem of the targeted machines.

It isnt clear whether a machine that had been set up in this way with
AnyDesk set to run under Safe Mode would even be remotely manageable by
its legitimate owner. The operator of the machine might need to
physically interact with the computer in order to manage it.

In some instances weve also seen the attackers employ a tool called
Chisel, which creates a tunnel over HTTP, with the data encrypted using
SSH, that the attackers can use as an secure back channel to the
infected machine.

There are also other indications that, in some of the attacks, there had
been lateral movement and other indicators of malicious behavior which
were saved in the Event Logs of some machines.

And in this case, theres an Event Log entry that shows a base64-encoded
PowerShell script being executed, with the results being output to a
file called execute.bat, which is then run, and finally deleted.

In another Event Log entry, theres a record of a port being set up as a
proxy on the targeted machine, which would theoretically help the
attackers conceal any lateral movement by routing all commands through
the proxy computer.

Were also investigating the use by Avos of a Linux ransomware component
that targets VMware ESXi hypervisor servers by killing any virtual
machines, then encrypting the VM files. The above command was used to
iterate and terminate any virtual machines that were running on the
hypervisor. It still isnt clear how the attackers obtained the
administrators credentials needed to enable the ESX Shell or access the
server itself.

Deploy like an IT pro

The attackers also appear to have leveraged another commercial IT
management tool known as PDQ Deploy to push out Windows batch scripts to
machines they planned to target. Sophos Rapid Response has created a
chart that highlights the consequences of one of these batch files
running. The batch files are run before the computer is rebooted into
Safe Mode.

These batch scripts orchestrate stages of the attacks and lay the
groundwork for the final phase in which the threat actors deploy the
Avos Locker ransomware. One of the batch scripts we recovered was called
Love.bat (shown above), which was pushed out to machines on the network
by the PDQDeployRunner service. We also saw batch files named update.bat
or lock.bat with small variations in them.

These orchestration scripts modified or deleted Registry keys that
effectively sabotaged the services or processes belonging to specific
endpoint security tools, including the built-in Windows Defender and
third party software from companies such as Kaspersky, Carbon Black,
Trend Micro, Symantec, Bitdefender, and Cylance. The script disables
Windows Update and attempts to disable Sophos services, but the tamper
protection feature prevents the batch script from succeeding.

The attackers also used the batch script to create a new user account on
the infected machine (newadmin) and give it a password (password123456),
and add it to the Administrators user group. They then set the machine
to automatically log in when it reboots into Safe Mode. The attackers
also disable certain registry keys used by some networks to display a
legal notice upon login. Disabling these features reduces the chance
that the automatic login will fail because a dialog box waiting for a
human to click it is holding up the process.

The penultimate step in the infection process is the creation of a
RunOnce key in the Registry that executes the ransomware payload,
filelessly, from where the attackers have placed it on the Domain
Controller. This is a similar behavior to what weve seen IcedID and
other ransomware do as a method of executing malware payloads without
letting the files ever touch the filesystem of the infected computer.

The final step in the batch script is to set the machine to reboot in
Safe Mode With Networking, and to disable any warning messages or ignore
failures on startup. Then the script executes a command to reboot the
box, and the infection is off to the races. If for whatever reason the
ransomware doesnt run, the attacker can use AnyDesk to remotely access
the machine in question and try again manually.

The global Coronavirus pandemic has left startups bruised and battered.
Liquidity has been dried up for investors to deploy surplus capital into
new ideas.

Startups and early-stage investors hoping to get back in deal-making
mode later this year might have to wait for a much longer period before
things get back to as normal as they were before Coronavirus pandemic.
Out of 139 startup investors globally, over 62 per cent believed that
startups and early-stage investing community will experience the impact
of COVID-19 for up to two years before things settle down, according to
a survey by famed seed accelerator and early-stage venture fund 500
Startups. 10-year old Silicon Valley-based fund is among the famous
startup accelerators and funds globally having churned out over a dozen
unicorns including Grab, Credit Karma, Twilio, Talkdesk, GitLab and
more.

The global Coronavirus pandemic has left startups bruised and battered.
Public markets have taken a significant hit and so liquidity has been
dried up for investors to deploy surplus capital into new ideas. The
focus has been now on conserving cash for existing portfolio startups.
The survey claimed that for the majority of investors their investment
allocation to startups will decline due to Covid-19. Nearly 14 per cent
said the change would be 51-75 per cent less than usual, close to 17 per
cent believed 26-50 per cent decline while 11.51 per cent said the
allocation would be 10-25 per cent.

"VCs are doing the same thing that angels are doing. Because it is
isolation, you are not able to talk to startups. How long and how many
deals can you close by connecting online. You cannot move from one
building to another. You cannot close deals like that. Also, I know a
lot of portfolio companies will miss their growth projections since a
lot of cash is diverted to Coronavirus-related expenses. Coronavirus
will be one major factor for startup shutdowns or failures in 2020,"
Padmaja Ruparel, Co-founder, Indian Angel Network had told Financial
Express Online.

According to the data intelligence company CB Insights and PwC, global
VC funding declined 10 per cent in Q1 2020 from the year-ago period. VCs
poured $50.7 billion across 3,344 in startups across the world. On the
other hand, the impact of Covid-19 has also triggered the interest of
investors in sectors that weren't as attractive as e-commerce before the
pandemic. Among the top sectors seeing increased interest in the
affected industries this year are healthcare, remote work solutions,
logistics, productivity software, mental health etc.

What PropTech startups want: A Brigade REAP survey builds a case

The real estate industry is slowing waking up to the benefits of
technology, which means that proptech startups have a huge opportunity
to tap. But what do India's proptech startups need to succeed? Brigade
REAP ran a survey to investigate this.

Real estate startups, just like startups in other sectors, are
struggling to raise funds. Over 65 percent of startups surveyed by
Brigade REAP, a real estate-focused startup accelerator programme, said
that fund-raising was their biggest problem.

The second key challenge was something that can prove to be a huge
obstacle for any company - getting the right connect at a potential
customer.

An arm of the Brigade Group, a major real estate player in South India,
Brigade REAP was established to bring in innovation and agility in the
real estate, retail and hospitality industry. The first cohort was
launched in October 2016 and the programme has mentored 24 startups
since then and interacted with over 2,000. The fifth cohort had its Demo
Day late last month.

Ankur Nandi, Sr Investment Analyst at Brigade REAP, points out that the
real estate industry has traditionally lagged in terms of adopting
innovative and disruptive technologies.

"Labour productivity has been stagnating for decades and projects going
over budget by as much as 80 percent is fairly common. The sector is
waking up to the benefits of technology for reducing wastage and
improving efficiencies. PropTech startups have a golden opportunity to
revolutionalise the real estate sector with their offerings."

However, having mentored multiple startups, they realised that there is
a lot of difference between what the industry demands and what startups
are offering.

"To bridge this gap, it was critical to get to get a better
understanding of the startups' expectation from the real estate
industry," Ankur explains.

In order to uncover these expectations and to gain lateral insights,
Brigade REAP conducted a purpose-built survey spanning over 100 startups
of different types - from those with just a prototype to those who had
raised external funding.

What the survey found

Sixty-five percent of startups surveyed ranked fund-raising as their top
challenge. The group at Brigade REAP dug a little deeper to discover
what were the key requirements that startups needed to fulfil to be able
to raise money.

"We found five key factors," says Ankur. These were:

1. An innovative solution for a pressing problem

2. A balanced, competent and ambitious team

3. Clarity on roadmap - business and product

4. A large addressable market, and

5. A well-thought-out pricing model and some traction with potential
clients

The next big challenge, the survey found, was sales closure (the
top-ranking challenge for 59 percent of respondents), followed by
customer connect (55 percent).

Given that the PropTech segment is somewhat nascent, startups in this
area struggle to close deals for a variety of reasons.

"We found startups suffered from a distinct lack of clarity about who
their customer is - within the client organisation. They are not sure
who they can approach and don't know who the decision-makers are,"
explains Ankur.

And when they do, they face the classic problem of lack of credibility,
the survey found. This is a double-edged sword.

* Firstly, early-stage startups may not have the right business and
pricing models, which tends to put off established real estate players.

* Secondly, even when the pricing, etc. fits, the failure rates of
startups escalates the risk in the client's mind.

As a report by the IBM Institute for Business Value and Oxford
Economics, found, close to 90 percent of startups fail within the first
five years. A startup, by definition, is young. In a time-intensive
business like real estate, clients are often unwilling to take the risk
that a startup may not survive the duration of the project.

Then there is the problem of being unfamiliar with the nuances of the
complex and massive industry that real estate is.

"When a startup diligently pays attention to all these areas, we see
that it starts attracting not only investors, but interest from the
right kind of investors for the growth of their business. We have seen
this play out multiple times through the companies that we have mentored
through our five cohorts so far," adds Ankur.

What else do PropTech startups struggle with?

According to the survey, startups struggle with three more areas in the
following order of priority.

1. Brand building - to increase visibility and credibility

2. Hiring key resources, resource planning, and devising a team
structure

3. Mentorship - startups know what their weaknesses are and want help to
address these problems.

"The findings reinforce common wisdom about the wide range of
opportunities that startups could exploit in the real estate and
construction industry," points out Ankur.

Is the real estate industry ready to adopt tech and work with startups?

Tech is yet to become an integral part of the real estate industry. As
per a 2016 study by McKinsey & co, the sector deploys less than 1
percent of revenue on technology. This resonates with the startups'
opinion that real estate players have been slow in the rate of
technology adoption, which translates into a relatively large potential
customer pool and an underutilised market.

The survey found that two out of every three startups believe that
technology adoption is limited to a few players only. This emboldens
them to go after the large customer base that they perceive to be still
unserved by technological and material innovation.

While a majority of the early PropTech startups such as Housing.com, No
Broker and Magic Bricks squarely operated in the B2C segment, the
segment has rapidly evolved in the past few years. The novelty of
aggregation businesses and marketplaces has also worn off, both with
startups as well as investors.

Over 80 percent of PropTech startups surveyed are aggressively targeting
the B2B and B2B2C segments. This is also in sync with the broader market
scenario.

"We firmly believe that marketplace businesses suffer from too many
players with little differentiation between them. This has been proven
by consolidations and business closures in this space. This market
scenario has given rise to a number of promising startups that focus
exclusively on the B2B or B2B2C space, where there is a lot more clarity
around pain points than before," explains Ankur.

Commenting on how the bulk of companies surveyed were three years old,
he said, "Our explanation for that is that the initial novelty of
transformation of traditional businesses and business processes over to
digital has worn off and that industry has seen a lot of consolidation.
The B2C segment in the PropTech world has already been exploited. The
industry is looking out for real solutions that can solve some real
world problems from the real estate industry. Any aspiring PropTech
startup must possess a disruptive technology that can help the industry
battle some of the crucial problems in arrears where there is less or no
tech intervention."

PropTech startups generating revenue?

Yes, PropTech startups are generating revenues. The survey found that a
good number of startups are posting aggressive growth numbers (see
figure below), quite possibly as a direct result of the shift to the B2B
segment. "Businesses look at startups as a bonafide means of introducing
innovation and a way for businesses to remove traditional inefficiencies
and leakages," adds Ankur.

As Ankur puts it, "This survey has reinforced the belief that the
PropTech industry is healthy and growing. The emergence of PropTech
startups has also forced the industry to take a hard look at traditional
wastage, expenditure, and inefficiency. At the same time, they have
allowed customers to make better decisions with the aid of all the
technology and data that is on offer."

Why Malaysia's Nexea believes corporate VCs themselves are not creating
enough value

Mar 26, 2018( e27: http://www.e27.sg Delivered by Newstex) Corporate VC
happens to be just one of the tools to achieve corporate innovation
goals; by itself, it usually ends up not creating enough value because
the subject matter of corporate innovation itself is quite complex
'Everybody wants to be a billionaire, but 99 per cent of people are not
willing or capable to do what it takes,' says Ben Lim, Venture Partner
at Malaysia-based angel startup
accelerator-cum-angel-investor-networkNexea[1]. Since Grab's[2] entry
into the coveted 'Unicorn' startup club sometime in 2016, no other
Malaysian-borncompanies have made it to the list. There are quite
afactors contributing toa company's elevation to the coveted club, and
the size of a company's targeted market is all the more important
factor. Given the small size of Malaysia,companies targeting only the
local marketare unlikely to be a unicorn. But does this mean Malaysian
firmsstandno chance to becomea unicorn?

To get aclearpicture of thecurrentstartup and investment scene, e27sat
with Ben Lim and Noomi Fessler — venture partners at Nexea[3] which has
accelerated and funded more than 30 startups in Southeast Asia. Below
are the edited excerpts: While VC firms are on the rise in Malaysia,
startups are still relying more on equity crowdfunding platforms (ECFs).
Why do you think this trend exists? Is it because startups don't really
trust VCs?Lim: Nexeahas actually backed a few startups as a lead
investor including ParkIt[4],which has raised money on PitchIn. We
seeequitycrowdfunding (ECF)[5] platforms as being complementary, more
than being an alternative. If a startup solely wants to raise money, ECF
is a good option to do that. VCs and angel investors tend to bring in
more strategic value in knowledge, experience and networks in
comparison. They actively support the company, for example,through
mentorship and introductions. However, VCs must invest according to
growth and exit opportunities, which most businesses cannot meet. Also
Read: Uber officially sells Southeast Asia assets to Grab, including
food delivery service[6] Retail investors are not bound by that, thus
they can invest in both scalable startups and more traditional
businesses - which we see a lot on ECF platforms.From my conversations
with several angels in Malaysia, Ihave learntthat services-based
startups are getting moreattentionthan product startups. Why so? Do you
see the trend to reverse in the near future?Lim: If we define product
startups as such that have a physical product to manufacture and sell,
it is a more traditional business model - with heavy investments in
assets and workforce required to grow. The startup capital for that is
much higher, making their take-off harder. Also, manufacturing plays an
important role in physical products, and that gives Chinese players
stronger cost and market size advantages. Nexea's Venture Partner Ben
Lim At Nexea, we focus on investing into highly-scalable startups.
Platforms/marketplaces and SaaS companies are the most common. Those
startups don't necessarily invent new products or technologies. They
leverage on existing technologies and build a new business model around
it. We do not see a strong reversal trend coming up, as Malaysia's
economy is moving towards services, and most of the recently emerging
unicorns globally tend to be service-based anyway. It is only natural
because their cost-to-scale is much lower.Despite havinga huge mobile
internetpopulation, Malaysia is trailing other markets in the region in
terms of the growth of tech startups? What could be the reasons for this
relatively slow growth?Lim: Many startups that we see in Malaysia are
not precisely targeting the entire mobile population in the country. For
example, we have a market where users prefer many different languages.
This makes Malaysia a tougher home ground to conquer. Supply and demand
plays a role too. In Singapore, for example, there is a huge number of
VCs with a limited number of good startups — and this leads to more
startups being funded. There is a similar effect in Indonesia as well,
because the market size of Indonesia attracts a huge number of foreign
VCs. Over time, we should see this level out across the region as VCs
establish themselves deeper into each country. Fessler: That being said,
Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation[7] (MDEC) is doing a great job in
bringing more VCs into the country. This means more money per round for
great startups and a higher chance of getting funding for the rest. The
government is looking to implement RM20 million (US$5.12 million) tax
incentives for corporates, who invest inVCs,so we expect to see more
startups being funded in the near future.Where is the startup ecosystem
in Malaysia heading for? What sort of startups have the potential to
become unicorns like Grab? Do new-age technologies like AI, IoT and
blockchain hold any potential in the country?Lim: To become a unicorn, a
key requirement is that the market being challenged is big enough. We
see SaaS companies and marketplace business models having better market
opportunities as they can scale cross-border quicker. Exclusive:
Malaysian ECF platform Ata Plus working on Crowdfund of Funds, closed
Secondary Exchange[8] I am not too excited to say that we currently get
a small number of startup funding applications, who leverage narrow-AI,
IoT and even blockchain technology to solve real-world problems.What is
Nexea? How is this accelerator-cum-fund different from other early-stage
funds in Malaysia and Southeast Asia? What is your average ticket size?
What is the investment philosophy?Fessler: Nexea'sfirst investments were
done by individual angel investors. That's where our roots are in angel
investing. Today, we are a startup fund and accelerator, but we are
still backed by over 20 highly experienced investors and mentors.
Several of our startups wouldn't be where they are today if it wasn't
for the mentorship and connections provided by our angel partners. We
are very thankful to have them and work on providing them with more good
co-investment opportunities in the future. Nexea's Venture Partner Noomi
Fessler As to your question to our ticket size: We fund anywhere between
RM50,000 (US$12,800) and RM1 million (US$260,000). What works well for
Nexeais to fund startups via our accelerator programme and to continue
to back the successes afterwards. For us, the accelerator is all about
providing the maximum support for thesix months, to help to validate the
business, and to make our startups investable. We are currently running
our third accelerator batch — with the current one in partnership with
Sunway iLabs. In both previous rounds, we funded some founders right
after the accelerator. That's really our goal for the programme. Without
follow-on funding, startups can't scale — and then what's the point of
an accelerator programme?To date you have backed overa two
dozenstartups. How many more are you planning to fund? Any new deals in
the pipeline?Fessler: We've invested in 30-plus companies to date. At
the moment, we are working closely with our new accelerator startups.
For those that succeed in validating their business model, we are happy
to back those companies with more investments. Apart from that, we are
evaluating approximately 50 startups every month, and the deal flow is
constantly increasing. There's no lack of deals. But what really matters
to us is that we invest in companies that can scale fast and where we
can add value to grow the business faster. That's where we have become
more selective, compared to our earlier days. Since last year, we
focused on highly scalable tech startups. That's really where our
expertise is, and where most mentors are experienced with and are able
to help most. To support scalable startups, we have also partnered with
Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure to provide huge value for them.Does any
startup ofyour portfoliohave the potential to be a unicorn?Fessler: A
majority of the startups we invest in have the right fundamentals to be
one. The key is a big enough market size and the right business model —
or a business that's able to expand globally, or at least,
regionally.Given the small size of the market, do you encourage your
startups to explore large Asian markets like India and China?Lim: The
market size in China is attractive, but the competitive landscape is
such that, let's be frank, most smaller foreign companies don't stand a
chance. The list of companies that got burnt in those markets is long
and includes cash rich, huge MNCs from around the world. We usually
encourage startups to stay in their home country before going for the
rest of Southeast Asia. The home country serves as a ground to test and
validate the business. Southeast Asia is an attractive region to play
in, and still relatively untouched, for example, compared to China.
However, that's just our general observation. The expansion strategy
must, of course, fit the startup and business model.From your experience
of incubating and investing in several startups, what are the greatest
strengths of Malaysian entrepreneurs, compared to their counterparts in
other Asian markets?Fessler: Malaysia's diversity is an advantage. From
day one, entrepreneurs can learn to address different markets in the
same country. Regional expansion can be done with less friction. Some
founders leverage on this opportunity even more and bring on board team
members from diverse backgrounds. Such teams tend to do better over
time. The team would have more experience to pull upon when solving
unique problems. They also understand a broader range of different types
of customers. Lim: And second, as Malaysia is catching up with developed
markets, we are able to understand both types of markets — developing
and developed. This gives us a natural advantage in operating in both
environments when expanding. Foreign companies from developed markets
have had issues setting foot in developing countries precisely because
it is hard for them to understand the differences in the maturity of the
market.What is lacking in entrepreneurs in Malaysia? Is the fear of
failure more rampant among startups?Lim: Globally, there's not enough
awareness among founders on how likely a startup is going to fail. The
startup industry is an exciting space to be in - disrupting, fast pace,
and with endless opportunities. That is exactly why many people are
attracted to it. Everybody wants to be a billionaire, but 99 per cent of
people are not willing or capable to do what it takes. It requires
extremely hard work and persistence, but also natural resourcefulness
and entrepreneurial talent. It also requires a good understanding of
business fundamentals - many founders lack that but are not willing to
continue to learn every single day.Where is the Malaysian startup
ecosystem heading for? What does the future hold for it?Lim: The quality
of the average startup has improved tremendously over the past years.
Business plans are becoming more solid. More founders are coming out of
their previous job or company, and they are starting to tackle very
specific problems in a market they understand well. And there are huge
opportunities for entrepreneurs in Malaysia. Also Read: Malaysia
partners with global ecosystem partners to boost tech ambitions[9]
Malaysia offers different cultural test markets, low costs of
operations, a strategic geographical position, and a growing market.
It's relatively easy to start a business, and the government has been
very supportive in pushing both startups and investors to grow. It's
really the perfect place in Southeast Asia to start a business, and we
expect a lot more startups to emerge from our ecosystem.How is the angel
investment ecosystem growing in Malaysia?Fessler: Until today, many
deals are done privately, and it is hard to get accurate figures. The
Malaysian Business Angel Network [10](MBAN) has 200 registered members,
but there is a much larger number of non-registered angels. However, we
see a strong trend of investors registering with associations like MBAN,
or joining companies like Nexea. It just offers a lot of advantages.
Joining us means getting a much larger deal flow, and spreading the risk
through co-investments. Many investors join us to learn, too, and they
become very sophisticated in evaluating startups and adding value to
them. We provide a process for that. We also have angel investors
approaching us that are company owners or part of a family fund to learn
about startup investments.How is the corporate VC industry shaping up in
the country? Do you look to partner with private companies to launch
CVCs?Lim: Corporate VCs[11] and accelerators happen to be just some of
the tools to achieve corporate innovation goals. By themselves, they
usually end up not creating enough value because the subject matter of
corporate innovation itself is quite complex. In corporates, we have
what we call natural antibodies to innovation where their natural KPIs
will always conflict with innovation goals. Therefore, there needs to be
a strong methodical approach to foster the right environments for
innovation to thrive within the corporate space. Innovative structures
can be created to grow new revenue streams, to attract and retain
entrepreneurial talent, and even to attain an innovation culture.
Corporates are already approachingNexea to talk about ways to get their
hands on next-generation businesses — or even to find ways to innovate
internally. The post Why Malaysia's Nexea believes corporate VCs
themselves are not creating enough value[12] appeared first on e27[13].

FIVE Gladstone business people will share their secrets of success from
the lessons they have learned from past failures.

StartUp Gladstone's Luis Arroyo said the event on Wednesday night would
be hosted in conjunction with the Gladstone Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.

"It's the next iteration of the F#ckUp event which was held several
months ago where business owners shared the lessons they'd learned from
their greatest mistakes," he said. "#Bizfail4680 is another level of
learning from Gladstone's business leaders."

Mr Arroyo said the event was about setting a baseline to meet on an
equal footing with other business owners.

"People in business don't like sharing stories about their
vulnerability," he said.

"#Bizfail4680 is all about bridging those rivalries and helping each
other learn.

"It's an open and honest exchange of information which will help people
in the audience identify with the speakers."

The event features five guest speakers.

"Richa Joshi is a designer, originally from India," Mr Arroyo said. "She
has lived and worked in America and now Australia for the last six
years.

"She wears multiple hats, she's the president of the Multicultural
Association and she's the mother of two as well.

"She's the next generation of entrepreneurs, a mumpreneur.

"Richa will be sharing some of her personal experiences in regards to
that in Australia and from overseas."

Another mumpreneur to speak on the night is Louise Dowling.

"Louise operates in the health, beauty and well-being industry," he
said.

"She'll be sharing the things she has encountered in that sector, what
has and hasn't worked in a very exciting time."

Mr Arroyo said another presenter, Adam Balkin, the owner of Port Curtis
Ferry Services was "absolute gold".

He said the best lessons in business were learned from past mistakes.

"We want to see more businesses succeeding and learning from one
another," Mr Arroyo said. "What are the things that we aren't running
now that we should be, epecially from the grass roots."

#Bizfail4680 is held at the Grand Hotel, Wednesday, October 17 from
5.30-7.30pm.

Tickets are $25 and can be booked through the Eventbrite website.

The classic startup formula and spoilers in this script

MINT

March 28, 2022 Monday

Copyright 2022 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 960 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, March 28 -- what's common to Amanda Seyfried, Jared Leto,
Jesse Eisenberg and Joseph Gordon-Levitt? The answer: They have all been
cast as flawed tech entrepreneurs in movies or TV shows, living an
unsteady life hovering on the thin line separating bad from good,
immoral from ethical, and hustle from fair bargaining. These actors
portray Elizabeth Holmes (of Theranos), Adam Nuemann (WeWork), Mark
Zuckerberg (Facebook) and Travis Kalanick (Uber), respectively, on
screens big and small.

Most of them end up blowing up their company, getting sacked,
constructing questionable business models, or, as with Holmes, facing
criminal charges. The jostling, the snake-oil-salesmanship, the insane
sums of money venture capitalists (VCs) and private equity (PE) funds
pour into fragile projects, the rhetoric-on-loop about changing the
world, the leaching of money from these companies, the hubris and
lifestyles, all of which eventually lead to a meltdown, seem
irresistible to script writers.

Good screenplays are almost always about human frailties and failings.
The most successful personalities-whether politicians, sportspersons or
even academics-are seen to have some chink or the other in their
character that enables human folly. This is the lodestone that
screenwriters apparently love mining. Silicon Valley and its obsessive
culture have presented filmmakers with a beribboned package.

This is not restricted to Silicon Valley. India also has its fair share
of brittle and febrile tech entrepreneurs. The latest example is the
indecorous and public spat between Ashneer Grover, former managing
director of fintech company BharatPe, and the company's board of
directors. The increasingly acrimonious squabble eventually led to
Grover's resignation from the company he founded, and the board
subsequently sacking his wife, Madhuri Jain (a controller in BharatPe).
A barrage of claims and counter-claims were exchanged between Grover and
the BharatPe board. While there is no way of checking the veracity of
these allegations and counter-allegations, it is Grover who seems to
emerge stained from this fiasco.

It seems Grover's problems started when he crossed swords with a key
investor, VC fund Sequoia. Incidentally, it was a public argument with
Sequoia that had led to the ouster of another startup founder, Rahul
Yadav of Housing.com.

The dispute between Rahul Yadav and the company's board also spilled out
into the public domain. Angry letters were exchanged between the two
parties, and duly leaked to the media. The ugly fist-fest ended with the
board sacking the founder. The company was sold off and Yadav went off
to pursue the life of a 9-to-5 employee in one of Mumbai's leading real
estate consulting firms.

At another level, the Rocket Internet-backed FoodPanda's Indian
business-one of the many food delivery services that had sprung up in
India to cater to the country's ever-hungry middle-class-had to be sold
(and eventually shut down) because of severe problems of governance in
the company, which included fake restaurant listings, botched up
deliveries, unpaid dues to restaurants and unethical practices relating
to human relations.

In fact, at a broader level, many failures in the startup universe can
be attributed to lack of governance norms, both at the company level and
the PE-VC fund level. This is the classical challenge for startups where
the founder finds it difficult to graduate from a hands-on progenitor to
a professional manager. Even at the investor level, many fund managers
succumb to the god illusion.

Take this argument a step further. PE firms in India can perhaps be held
partially responsible for some of the problems endemic to India's
startup culture: making easy money available on tap, no due diligence of
the investee company's management quality leading to rancour and
recrimination, unqualified fund managers (former retail bankers end up
managing complex structured portfolios), corruption including kickbacks,
and lack of governance in PE funds bleeding into investee companies.
There are also concerns about the provenance of PE funds, though nothing
has ever been proven. Like all other industries, there are the good guys
and the no-so-good guys; unfortunately, opacity in VC-PE functioning has
fanned suspicions over their operations.

As an example of why such misgivings aggravate, look no further than the
recent share sale by One97 Communications, popularly known as Paytm. The
company's initial public offering was priced at Rs.2,150 per share, but
the stock is now trading around Rs.546, having lost nearly 75% of its
market value since it listed four months ago. In the absence of profits
over prolonged periods, many felt that the sale was over-priced; and
yet, some premier PE funds acted as anchor investors at Rs.2,150 a pop.

The height of miscalculation was actually Masayashi Son's Softbank
investing close to $17 billion in WeWork, which crashed and had to be
taken over by Softbank.

Television, much like its take-down of Silicon Valley's
fake-it-till-you-make-it culture, has also been unsparing of VC and PE
funds: the diet-conscious but mechanistic Laurie Bream in Silicon Valley
or the coke-snorting and loyalty-shifting Stewy Hosseini in Succession
are some examples. Hollywood screenwriters seem to have discovered a
goldmine in the junction between tech startups and VC-PE funds, where
the prospect of making money serves too often as an excuse to overlook
egregious behaviour.

Measured leadership; Pitstick guides Gates through pandemic

Rubber & Plastics News

December 14, 2020

Print Version

Section: Pg. 1; Vol. 50

Body

The core values at Gates Corp.-accountability, collaboration, tenacity,
curiosity and dedication-are embodied in Tom Pitstick.

But the senior vice president of strategic planning and chief marketing
officer at Gates has another trait in spades, one that has proven to be
crucial during the pandemic: crystal clear communication skills.

And the leadership he showed while helping guide Denver-based Gates
through the coronavirus-dominated year is one of the key reasons
Pitstick was selected as Rubber & Plastics News' 2020 Rubber Industry
Executive of the Year.

Much of Pitstick's life has been about bridging gaps, whether that has
meant establishing crucial lines of communication with Gates' 14,000
employees or melding the blue collar, hardworking values of the Midwest,
where he was born, with the entrepreneurial and technological spirit of
the Silicon Valley, where he attended college.

Fittingly, Pitstick has settled in the geographic middle, choosing the
Mile High City with the Rocky Mountains as its backdrop, where he works
at the Gates Corp. headquarters. Pitstick began at Gates in 2016, coming
from the much larger Eaton Corp., where he worked for five years between
Cleveland and Milwaukee as senior vice president of global marketing,
electrical sector.

"I think part of it was getting back to engineering," Pitstick said of
what drew him to the power transmission and fluid transfer product
manufacturer four years ago. "Gates is smaller, relatively speaking,
when compared to a company like Eaton. But I have also worked at 15
startups. It's a little bit of a 'Goldilocks' moment in the sense that
Gates is just right, right between the Eatons and the startups."

While Gates' revenues are around $3 billion per year, Eaton's are north
of $20 billion.

"Gates is in that nice middle ground. It feels a bit like a family
business," Pitstick said. "It's small enough to know a lot of people and
big enough to have an impact. But you can still 'steer the ship.' "

His position at Gates mirrors the "middle ground" as well, as it
straddles engineering and marketing in the research and development
space. He started at Gates as senior vice president of innovation,
before a restructuring added global marketing, product line management,
and corporate development and strategy to his job description.

"What is exciting about Gates and others in (the) rubber industry is
that the material science we deploy is underappreciated," he said.
"Whether they are for hoses or belts or tires, or anything in
between-there is a lot of science that goes into what we do. The
elastomer world is really unique. People think it's a black art. But
there is a ton of material science being deployed every day."

Fast forward to early 2020, when Pitstick found himself at the forefront
of a company-wide response to the pandemic. He adopted a sharp focus on
local, state, federal and international regulations, and on the safety
of Gates' employees.

In many ways, it was his measured leadership when the stakes were
highest that prompted colleagues to nominate Pitstick as the RPN
Executive of the Year.

"Over the past unprecedented year, Tom has been instrumental in
navigating the company's COVID-19 response, managing crisis
communications and providing steadfast leadership to Gates employees and
stakeholders, making him an excellent candidate for consideration for
this year's Executive of the Year Award," the nomination states. "The
plan prioritized employees' health and safety across the globe, worked
with local government and public health agencies to adhere to changing
requirements, and took concrete steps to minimize disruptions to the
company's logistics and manufacturing operations and worldwide customer
base."

Learning to lead

Pitstick was born in a suburb of Chicago, and spent time as a child on a
rural, central Illinois farm where his father, one of 12 children, grew
up.

"My dad was the first member of our family to go to college, after he
fell off a tractor and broke his back," Pitstick said. "This pushed him
toward going to college. But we all had a very hands-on, fix-it
mentality-the notion that if you're not going to do it right, then don't
do it at all. The expectation was always to do a good job."

The Pitsticks truly were a renaissance family plugged into the heart of
the Midwest, installing and fixing their own electric and plumbing
lines, and building whatever was required at the homestead.

"I wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was growing up ... my friend's
dad was a pilot," he said. "I was the kid who took things apart and put
them back together, and not always correctly. I was very mechanical and
was interested early on in aerospace."

His parents later left the suburbs of Chicago for the sun-baked valleys
of Southern California, where Pitstick ultimately attended Stanford
University after undergraduate work at the University of Notre Dame.
Pitstick received advanced business and engineering degrees as a
Cardinal and an undergraduate degree in engineering as a Golden Domer.

"My education and career choices kind of mirrored my values," he said.
"I kind of took the best of the Midwest and the best of Southern
California and found Denver (and Gates), a nice intersection between the
'get your hands dirty' of the Midwest and West Coast entrepreneurialism,
with their tech and their awareness of the importance of the
environment.

"I think that creates an opportunity, if you add those values
together-there is a magic to be had there, keeping the roots of the
entrepreneurial spirit but staying true to innovation."

Prior to his work with the larger corporations later in his career,
Pitstick cut his teeth on the rigors of startup companies, where an
intense focus is required and the survival instinct is very real.

"If you don't get it right, it doesn't work out," he said. "I had some
amazing experiences in the Silicon Valley, though, with people thinking
differently. This has become a part of my thought process for my career.
Big and stable companies have lots of resources, but cannot move as
quickly. Smaller companies are very agile, with few resources. In the
Silicon Valley, the failure rate of startups is a badge of honor; in
other parts of the world this is not the case."

Learning from those "failures" has benefited the 2020 Executive of the
Year, however.

"As a startup, you are not diversified enough to be able to make it if
things go wrong financially," Pitstick said. "Larger companies have a
specific, designed outcome, but you do not need to get it all right.

"I really enjoyed the entrepreneurship and the tech, but I missed the
resources of larger companies. I was able to find the best of both
worlds at Gates."

Part of the allure at Gates, Pitstick said, is the materials
construction and innovation surrounding the processes to make the power
transmission and fluid transfer products, such as ethylene elastomer
products.

"Their benefits are environmental, but there are also performance
advantages," he said. "We have innovated the material-and the process
around it."

Pitstick cited a kind of performance triangle between advanced materials
and product constructions (the mixture of materials, reinforcements and
fabrics) and the processes used to make the products.

"The way we're looking at innovation is that all three are required to
really have a significant impact on new product performance," he said.
"You might need the new material to enable some new performance, but
maybe the existing processes don't work with that material so you need
to innovate the process, too."

Besides his father, Pitstick said he has taken professional inspiration
and leadership traits from Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer and Gen.
Leslie Richard Groves Jr., all of whom were essential to the work on the
Manhattan Project, the development of the first atomic bombs in Oak
Ridge, Tenn.; Los Alamos, N.M.; and Hanford, Wash.

"These were the engineers who pushed the frontiers of science," he said.
"There was sheer excellence in the way they approached their problems.
And these were immigrants, whose stories were essential to the story of
America and entrepreneurialism."

Stepping up, staying informed

When a situation is complex and constantly changing like the current
pandemic, the message and communications should be simple, especially in
a company with thousands of employees like Gates, Pitstick said.

"Any time you can make things more basic, that is important," he said.
"Communication is key. With a startup company, it's real easy to
communicate with a few people-not so with a larger company. So we
overcommunicated any time we saw something."

And that goes for all forms of correspondence-from email, to weekly
leadership meetings, to Zoom calls. In total, Pitstick spearheaded more
than 100 communications with employees, internal and external
stakeholders, customers and suppliers.

"At the onset of the pandemic, Tom demonstrated effective leadership,
coordinating Gates' worldwide senior leadership teams in a series of
weekly global pulse calls with more than 250 leaders representing more
than 100 Gates facilities in 30 countries around the globe," his
colleagues noted in the nomination letter. "Moreover, Tom oversaw
successful multi-channel communications efforts to Gates' customers and
partners across the web, social platforms, media engagements and
customer and supplier letters."

And while no one at Gates has been through a pandemic before, the
109-year-old company certainly has with the 1918 Spanish flu.

"In crazy times like this, the executives and floor folks alike are all
learning together," he said. "It doesn't matter who you are, none of us
have been through this before. Core philosophies are important."

Though specific procedures from 1918 may not have been practical for the
coronavirus pandemic, Pitstick said the global nature of the company
today has been a guiding asset.

"I called it an advantage, having 100-plus locations in China, India and
throughout Europe and the Americas," he said. "We watched the
progression of the virus from mainland China and implemented what they
learned there. But news from local health authorities didn't flow
perfectly. We were implementing procedures in China, Japan, Singapore
and Taiwan, all while the U.S. was behind, wondering what this was."

An outbreak that occurred in South Korea affected three Gates employees,
and Pitstick used the situation to help shape the company's tracing and
quarantine policies elsewhere.

Pitstick and Gates implemented social distancing in factories,
reconfigured work spaces and break room spaces, closed gym facilities
and staggered start times. The company put up copious signage and
reminders to stay home if an employee felt sick.

Early on, the company instituted temperature checks for all employees.

"We still do it three times a day at our headquarters now," he said.

Pitstick said he was guided by four principles with his pandemic
determinations, most importantly ensuring the safety of employees; going
above and beyond the call of duty with adherence to regulations; making
a concerted effort to maintain customer support; and promoting the idea
that everything done as a collective, with a team-oriented philosophy,
makes the group stronger.

"More gets done, policies are emboldened, the team buys in and solutions
are found, from the production floor in preventing the virus to the
engineers making the innovations to the executives making the big calls
as a chaotic market fluctuates," Pitstick said.

Juggling the myriad government bodies and their regulations across 30
countries required a team of lawyers and quick implementation from
Pitstick.

"We have different regulations in two counties-12 miles apart-in Denver
alone," Pitstick said. "Our lawyers did a great job of keeping track of
regulations. And sometimes, many times, the statements from politicians
and the actual regulations were at odds, so it made it very important to
read the details of every regulatory order. Often times Gates already
was ahead of the game in terms of implementing protocols, learning from
policies that worked-and those that did not-in other countries.

"Gates leaders around the world took on the challenge, realizing we are
all in it together-and our geographic footprint helped us."

Pitstick also championed a humanitarian response through the Gates
Industrial Corporation Foundation, empowering Gates leaders across the
globe to target charitable donations within their local communities. The
foundation donated more than $535,000 to 150 non-profits directly
responding to the pandemic, with more than $100,000 given in Gates'
hometown of Denver alone. The foundation also offered double matching
for U.S. employee donations to COVID-19-related organizations, totaling
an additional $34,000 made in charitable contributions.

"One of things we did when our heads were back above water was to ask,
how can we use our resources to help? This was so global and pervasive,"
Pitstick said. "So we left it up to individual sites to figure out how
to deploy the funds, and we went region for region. Who are we in Denver
to figure out what the team in Poland needs?"

As for supply problems, Pitstick said the company tends to manufacture
for China in China, and for Europe in Europe.

"India was the one place where we did see a country-wide shutdown," he
said. "But from a raw materials standpoint, we really did not see any
problems. There were some late orders and others who were closed here
and there, but alternate sources were found and we shifted capacity all
around."

Pitstick said that after the trough of the curve occurred in the second
quarter, earnings have shown sequential improvement. Third-quarter net
sales of $712.2 million decreased 4.6 percent over the prior-year
quarter net sales of $746.6 million, according to Gates' third quarter
earnings report. Revenues have progressively strengthened, driven by
improvement of sales into replacement channels, which outperformed those
in OE channels, with the automotive replacement channel returning to
solid growth in Europe, China and North America.

"We are generally seeing recovery trends in every geography and end
market. It's not totally back to normal, but it's pretty darn close,"
Pitstick said. "At one point I looked out my window here in Denver to
see the cars, and you wondered for awhile where the neutron bomb went
off. Now we are cautiously optimistic and excited about the prospect of
a vaccine."

Brighter horizons ahead

What do the next 100 years hold for Gates? One of the challenges falls
directly on Pitstick's shoulders.

"One of the biggest things is how fast can we get new stuff out there,"
he said."We have accelerated innovation, its cadence and its output. How
do we get these things to market?"

Pitstick said the company eyes the autonomous and electric vehicle
markets as a "content opportunity," because the non-internal combustion
engine vehicles likely will have lots of hoses, water pumps and belts.

"The question on EVs is not really if, but when," Pitstick said. "We are
excited about the opportunity relative to the broader vehicle market."

Regardless of the era-whether 1918, 2020 or a future with a "new
normal"-Pitstick said perseverance is critical.

"We began by making horse bridles, those turned into belts for cars and
those became V-belts," he said. "We will need to reinvent ourselves
again. Companies who do not revitalize do not survive for 109 years.

"But we cannot rest on our laurels. We need to fail fast and learn
quickly. Perseverance, resilience and grit-we want people working
together as the entire production is more effective that way."

Coronavirus cripples funding in young startups as investors redirect

Amid the expected global slowdown in startup investments due to the
Coronavirus outbreak, the seed-stage financing would perhaps take the
maximum hit with 22 per cent likely fall in the first quarter of 2020
vis-a-vis 5 per cent growth in the preceding quarter and 9 per cent
growth in Q1 2019, showed data by market intelligence platform CB
Insights. "The acute decline in seed-stage deals can be attributed to
compounding economic factors - including uncertainty due to the spread
of coronavirus," the company said. Overall startup funding is expected
to go south by over 16 per cent to $77 billion in Q1 2020 as compared to
$92 billion in Q4 2019 and down close to 12 per cent versus $87 billion
in Q1 2019.

"I would, unfortunately, agree on this. Public markets are completely
down. So liquidity is dried up and so angel investors, individuals,
other investors are focusing on conserving their cash. Also, since they
have an investment in some good companies, they would think to park a
little bit of their money to help these existing companies rather than
investing in new companies," Padmaja Ruparel, Co-founder, Indian Angel
Network told Financial Express Online.

The impact is predicted to be less severe with respect to deal volume in
seed deals with only 8 per cent fall in Q1 2020. However, the negative
impact on Asian startups is likely to be starker with the slump in both
deal value and volume. Asian seed funding is expected to decline 37 per
cent while deals are likely to fall 24 per cent in the said quarter from
the previous quarter. While large investors are focusing more on
managing their existing portfolio companies instead of sourcing new
deals, angels and small venture capital funds, which make up for
majority seed-stage activity, are less likely to invest in the current
scenario.

"VCs are doing the same thing that angels are doing. Because it is
isolation, you are not able to talk to startups. How long and how many
deals can you close by connecting online. You cannot move from one
building to another. You cannot close deals like that. Also, I know a
lot of portfolio companies will miss their growth projections since a
lot of cash is diverted to Coronavirus-related expenses. Coronavirus
will be one major factor for startup shutdowns or failures in 2020,"
said Ruparel.

The Coronavirus may have a similar impact on startup funding that
previous virus outbreaks like SARS and Zika had in the impacted regions.
For instance, due to the SARS outbreak in November 2002 in Southern
China's Guangdong province that spread to more than 12 dozen countries,
private investments in Asia for 2003 and 2004 stood at just 27 per cent
and 29 per cent respectively below 2002 levels, according to CB
Insights, until Q3 2004 when the recovery was visible.

Angel investors can make the difference between getting a startup off
the ground and burning it to death. Here's what you need to know about
angel investment in India.

Beyond offering cash, angel investors can make the difference between
getting a startup off the ground and burning it to death. The importance
of the initial fund injection by an investor and their ability to
validate the business model, build a pilot, and connect with the first
customers is vital for an entrepreneur.

In a report, LetsVenture illustrates the number of deals angel investors
made and the amount of funding they poured in.

According to a report by YourStory, $173 million were raised in
Pre-Series A and angel rounds in 2018 by Indian startups.

While the number of deals and the amount invested may have decreased
from 2015 to 2018, the hands-on experience and the access to a network
still make angel investors invaluable for a startup.

This detailed guide shares everything you would want to know about
getting angel investment in the Indian startup ecosystem.

What does an angel investor look for while investing in a startup?

For a first-time entrepreneur, raising capital from outside can seem
daunting. Experienced angel investors are diligent in reviewing
investment proposals. Despite numerous founders approaching them, every
investor has certain boxes to check before they take interest in, inject
money, or give their time to a startup.

#1. A dynamic market opportunity

This is the first question most investors will start with - "How big is
the market your company is looking to cater to?"

This "big" includes the current scope as well as the future expansion.
If you're targeting an existing market, be prepared to answer how your
offerings are different from the other players. If it's an emerging
market, focus on answering how big the market is expected to grow in the
next few years and the growth drivers.

Rising tides lift boats. Angel investors are the first ones to place
their bets on the new boats - the promising industries.

#2. The team's ability to execute

A seasoned investor will be keen to know how well your team is
positioned to create and execute the business idea and become the market
leader.

The most common questions include:

* What is the domain expertise of your core team?

* Why are they considered authoritative figures in the market?

* Does the team have complementary skill sets?

* How is the chemistry between the team members?

* Do they work in sync with each other?

Highlight the strength of everyone on the team. Angel investors put
their faith in the jockey and not on the horse. While the business idea
may pivot over time, the team is responsible for the success or failure
of the startup.

#3. Traction

One way to vet a de-risk investment opportunity is by looking at the
momentum a company has gathered. This varies according to the company
and the industry, and can be - revenue, channel partners, and the number
of users or clients onboard.

This metric shows the investor that the market has already started
engaging with your startup's service or product and these users are
providing feedback. Commercial traction gives you an upper hand over
your competitors, who're still in the laboratory.

Having real data to support your claims allows you to adjust the
assumptions you started with. For an angel investor, it is a good
measure of the progress made so far by the team.

#4. Investor relevance

Investor-fit is one of the most important parameters for an entrepreneur
to consider while opting for an angel investor.

There are many checklists to be taken into consideration here, such as
the stage of your company, the industry you're targeting, and the
investor's experience in the relevant field.

Consider this to be a piece of the puzzle. When there are mutual
connections between the investor and the founder, the investor is more
likely to invest. Do your research before approaching them. This way,
you will remove the ones from your list who're not a good fit.

#5. The X-factor

There's always a click moment between the investor and founder that
affects the investment decision. Sometimes it's as simple as affinity,
based on the shared workplace, common background, college or a mutually
trusted and known connection.

At other times, it is harder to find the cause as it could be as general
as the likability of the founders or a gut feeling that's hard to shake
off.

It helps to be authentic and not salesy. Get to know the background of
the investor to present any common connections out of the meeting.

While fundraising can be difficult, you can use these 5 points to engage
with the angel investor. Often you won't get the cheque immediately but
then, even a second meeting is equivalent to having done a good job.

The active angel investors in the Indian startup ecosystem

Typically angel investors are experienced entrepreneurs who understand
what it takes to build a billion-dollar company since they've been
through the same phase.

their finances, these "angels" step in to provide the required support

Chandigarh Angels - Started by successful entrepreneurs-turned-investors
to help build promising businesses and scale them, Chandigarh Angel
Investors has 37 investors who have mentored 250 startups and funded 8
of them.

Gone are the days when angel investors used to be difficult to find.
Today, angel and seed investors are approachable. Angel investors take a
personal interest in you than having financial concerns - meaning they
strongly believe in you!

An individual investor may want to start the investment by pumping in
small amounts. The good thing here is that they will help you meet other
investors, who would then invest as a group.

How has been your experience in raising angel investment? We'd love to
hear.

Entrepreneurs)Execution is key to a startup's survival and growth
especially when it comes to fast-moving software and technology
products. Being in the tricky intersection of investors, customers and

Working with top VC managers key to unicorn investing: report; These
have an excellent track record of identifying, investing in and
developing seed companies, says UBS

investing: report

Singapore

INVESTING in unicorns - the holy grail for investors - is both
challenging and risky. But this may be overcome by a systematic,
diversified approach of investing with top-quartile venture capital
managers, according to an exclusive report by UBS.

Kasper Wichmann, UBS' head of private equity for the Asia-Pacific, says
in the report that even as unicorns - private companies with US$1
billion + valuation - are becoming more common, the challenges and risks
associated with identifying and investing in them are "considerable",
making it a "nigh-on impossible task for the individual investor".

For one thing, unicorn status is far and few between for startups, says
Mr Wichmann. Citing research by data firm CB Insights, he says that only
1 per cent of 1,098 US startups kicked off between 2008 and 2010 went on
to become unicorns, among them Uber, Airbnb and Slack.

It is also difficult to identify unicorns, Mr Wichmann says. Firstly, it
is hard to look seven to eight years ahead and predict if a venture will
work out. It is also challenging to turn a great idea into a viable
business, even if there is a mass market for it over time. Thirdly,
businesses suffer not through a lack of capital but a lack of know-how
and execution.

To quantify this, the report looks at eight business-critical events for
a startup: sufficient capital, capable management, product development,
supply chain, competitive environment, customer interest, product
pricing, and enforceable patents.

Applying a high probability of a successful outcome of 80 per cent on
each event leads to a combined probability of success of only 17 per
cent, the report finds. Moreover, if just one variable drops to a 50 per
cent probability, the combined probability of success falls to 10 per
cent, illustrating how critical these factors can be for success, the
report says.

It becomes even harder to invest in startups that are close to achieving
unicorn status, Mr Wichmann says. Firstly, prior investors have pro-rata
follow-on rights, which give them an option for the next round and
create a hurdle for new investors. Secondly, new investors need to be
approved and bring to the table other sources of value, such as industry
know-how and networks, on top of just capital.

"When you reach later rounds, money is a commodity. Just bringing money
is very unlikely to get you a seat at the table," says Mr Wichmann.

When investors do manage to invest in a startup with unicorn potential,
it comes with a lot of risk, he adds. In the early rounds - when the
upside of investing is said to be the greatest - there is often business
model and tech risk, and failure rates for startups can reach 65 per
cent.

In the later rounds, as the startup starts to generate revenue and has
overcome business model and tech risks, it still faces risks like market
competition, consumer demand and management execution. Mr Wichmann says:
"At this point, there is by no means a guaranteed positive outcome, let
alone the certainty, that the company will become a unicorn."

Even during the late stages or pre-initial public listing (IPO) rounds,
where "friends and family with big cheque books are welcomed as purely
financial investors to support continued rapid growth", there is,
contrary to common belief, still quite some risk, argues Mr Wichmann.

Investors in a pre-IPO round will often have the "least remaining
upside" and be the "most exposed to any form of market correction", he
says.

For instance, Snapdeal, an e-commerce startup and one of India's first
unicorns, was heading towards an IPO with a peak valuation of US$6.5
billion in 2016 when continued high cash burn and increased competition
from Amazon and Flipkart forced it into a down round and a valuation of
US$2.5 billion in early 2017, a figure that has since continued to
devalue.

Mr Wichmann says: "While the early-stage investors certainly took a hit,
they will all still make money on Snapdeal. It is however very unlikely
that the later-stage predominantly financial investors punting on a
pre-IPO round will recover more than fractions of their original
investments."

Nonetheless, there is a way to simplify the process of selecting and
investing in unicorns, he says. That is to invest in one or more
experienced managers, or "unicorn catchers", that have demonstrated an
excellent track record of identifying, investing in and developing seed
companies into unicorns. These include SV Angels, Sequoia Capital and
DST Global.

"They can do that because they have the expertise to not only invest in
long-term growth opportunities, but bring with them the expertise and
contacts that fledgling companies need to fulfil their potential," he
says.

Mr Wichmann's advice to investors is to leverage long-standing
relationships with top-quartile managers, invest in a diversified way
across a selection of these managers, and gain access to high-potential
startups. "A fund-of-funds strategy may be able to effectively overcome
the challenges of unicorn investing and deliver a high-potential
portfolio, while mitigating risk."

UBS Asset Management, which has since 2000 adopted a systematic,
diversified approach for its venture investment programme, has exposure
to 30 per cent of the world's over 240 unicorn companies today, and
invested in "a good number" of the top-performing venture capital
managers, going by the report.

Hall, with the top 20 gracing the Disrupt stage to launch their wares.
It's going to be a Disrupt to remember, and not just because of the
incredible speakers we have joining us at the show. Remember to book
your tickets to the show today before prices go up $1,100.  We have lots
more news and speakers to share in the coming weeks, but here is a first
peek! Billionaire Marc Lore sold his startup to an everything store,
twice. After inking deals with Amazon and Walmart, the Quidsi
and Jet.com co-founder aims to launch a "more equitable" city in the
desert. But first, he's tackling another problem: soggy delivery.
Venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is the largest and one of the
best-known funding sources for web3 startups. Alongside a16z founder
Marc Andreessen, general partner Chris Dixon has been integral to the
firm's rise as a giant in the crypto VC world - he was an early investor
in startups such as Coinbase, Uniswap and Oculus VR. Hear from Dixon
about how a16z crypto is putting its massive $7.6 billion pool of
capital to work by backing early-stage web3 companies. TechCrunch's
iconic startup competition is back, as entrepreneurs from around the
world pitch expert judges and vie for the Startup Battlefield Cup and
$100,000. Figma has grown into a successful startup with a $10 billion
valuation, but before he achieved those lofty heights, CEO and
co-founder Dylan Field was a young guy with an idea and no business
experience. Hear about the lessons he learned along the way and what he
would do differently if he could start over today. Nothing drives tech
innovation like sex. But after earning billions in revenue and providing
stable income to thousands of adult creators, OnlyFans dropped a
bombshell: it would ban porn. After creator backlash, those plans didn't
last long - the founding CEO stepped down, and now, Amrapali Gan and
Keily Blair are in charge. Hear from these newly installed execs about
what their leadership means for OnlyFans. TechCrunch's iconic startup
competition is back as entrepreneurs from around the world pitch expert
judges and vie for the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. Chief's
stamp of approval has an obvious allure. The social network is dedicated
exclusively to women in professional leadership positions, charging
thousands for a private membership (if you're lucky enough to get
accepted). It's a pitch that has landed thousands of members and, most
recently, a billion-dollar valuation as of May 2022. At Disrupt,
co-founders Carolyn Childers and Lindsay Kaplan will speak to the
milestone, the challenges in between and if exclusivity can disrupt
community. Johanna Faries is no stranger to the world of games. After a
stint at the NFL, she led Activision's esports leagues (the CDL and the
OWL) before taking over as general manager of Call of Duty, one of the
biggest video game franchises to ever exist. She speaks at Disrupt just
ahead of this year's launch: Modern Warfare II. We'll discuss her
strategic vision for Call of Duty as a game and as a community, as well
as her thoughts on the shifting landscape of gaming and esports. Serena
Williams is the greatest to ever play the game of tennis, and she's
already made a name for herself as a VC in the tech world. At Disrupt,
Williams and her Serena Ventures partner Alison Rapaport Stillman will
join us to discuss the next chapter of Serena's career, swapping out the
racket for several (hundred) inbound pitch-decks. We'll talk about their
investment thesis, her plans to bring more diversity into tech and what
she brings to the table as a VC. Rivian emerged from stealth in 2018
with a pair of vehicles that helped it become the buzziest EV automaker
since Tesla. The company landed high-profile investors and partners,
including Amazon and Ford, and is now publicly traded. Hear from founder
and CEO RJ Scaringe about the company's challenges with production
bottlenecks, supply chain constraints and layoffs as he leads the
company into the electric future. TechCrunch's iconic startup
competition is back, as entrepreneurs from around the world pitch expert
judges and vie for the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. Launched in
2020, Solana gained worldwide renown for being one of the fastest
blockchains with a rapidly growing developer ecosystem. It's arguably
the best-known of the "Ethereum Killers" because of its speed and low
transaction cost, but its rise has not been without hurdles. Hear from
its creator Anatoly Yakovenko about the opportunities and challenges
ahead as Solana seeks to take web3 to mobile devices in a push for mass
adoption. TechCrunch's iconic startup competition is back, as
entrepreneurs from around the world pitch expert judges and vie for the
Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. Cityblock Health has experienced
considerable growth on the back of a care model designed to actually
meet the recipients of care where they already are, while still
satisfying the needs of payers. It seems to be true accessibility in a
framework that works with the existing U.S. healthcare infrastructure,
but we'll hear from CEO Toyin Ajayi about the work that remains to be
done. Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation and a leading expert in digital security and
privacy, is set to speak on some of the biggest threats in cybersecurity
today. Hear about the shadowy world of startups shunning the spotlight -
spyware makers, hackers-for-hire and location data brokers - that are
changing the threat landscape for billions around the world, and how
data-hungry startups today risk becoming extensions of the surveillance
state tomorrow. VCs have never had so much capital socked away - with
$100 billion more in so-called dry powder than the end of last year,
according to Preqin - but with a tightening exit market, many are
"slowing their roll" and asserting more control over deals after years
of feverish dealmaking. What new terms are they introducing into deals?
Where are they forging ahead - and pulling back - and why? What do
founders need to know for their startups to survive and thrive in 2023
and beyond? TechCrunch's iconic startup competition is back, as
entrepreneurs from around the world pitch expert judges and vie for the
Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. Join us for a live recording of
Equity, the podcast about the business of startups. We'll unpack the
numbers and nuance behind the headlines, and wade through the hype to
keep you up to date on the world of business, tech and VC. If you
haven't heard of Nik, Josh or Gefen, where have you been? They are
founders that are not only building very interesting companies but have
taken a forward approach toward making noise on social media. We want to
dive into how being a public person can help founders build a future
public company. This is a panel that will be not only informative but
also lots of fun. Sponsored by: Q-CTRL Quantum computing is everywhere
you look - in mainstream press, tech news and investor newsletters. It's
described as transformational and disruptive; the quantum revolution is
coming, and you're told you will be left behind if you don't get ahead.
But how can someone without a PhD in quantum physics or an organization
far from quantum computing research benefit? In this session we'll give
an accessible overview of quantum computing and outline three simple
steps for anyone to take advantage of this transformational new
technology - no PhD required! Hiring is not easy even in the best of
times. With a tight tech talent market and an increasingly
remote-friendly - and therefore globally competitive - corporate
landscape, founders have never had more places to hire from and more
competitors to measure up against. So we're going to have Chris Herd
from Firstbase, who is an advocate for remote work, and Emil Yeargin, VP
of Talent at Gusto, which is not only hiring but also helps other
companies manage their staff. We'll go deep on hiring today with a
special focus on hard-to-fill roles. Ransomware attacks are escalating
at an alarming rate. We'll hear from experts about what winning the war
on ransomware looks like and how startups can play their part. While
it's always good to hear from venture capitalists when it comes to
dollars and cents, how founders are navigating the capital market is
just as important. So we're gathering Amanda DoAmaral of Fiveable, Sara
Du of Alloy Automation and Arman Hezarkhani of Parthean to talk us
through what worked for them and how their perspective has been updated
in light of the changing economy. The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it
a boom in e-commerce and folks working on making their homes more
comfortable. This shift impacted more than just consumers, however.
Faire, a marketplace that connects SMBs to wholesalers, had to navigate
a market replete with evolving demand and supply chain issues. Now, with
the COVID period behind us (at least from a business perspective),
TechCrunch will sit down with Faire co-founder and COO Jeff Kolovson and
backer Kirsten Green, a founder and partner at Forerunner Ventures, to
talk through the company, its market and where it's heading next. Reddit
Chief Product Officer Pali Bhat, AngelList CEO Avlok Kohli and Calendly
Chief Product Officer Annie Pearl are coming to Disrupt to help founders
hone their definitions of product-market fit. The concept, often
shortened to PMF, is tricky as it's not easily defined for all startups
at once. But one thing that happens when market sentiment takes a dive
is that definitions tighten. So how should founders measure PMF in a
more difficult market, from both a fundraising and customer perspective?
We'll find out. Join us for a live podcast recording of Chain Reaction
as we unpack and explain the latest crypto news, drama and trends,
breaking it down block-by-block for the crypto-curious. Not every
startup can generate revenue from day one. From hardware to hard
science, some startups take more time to build income streams. How can
founders get around revenue concerns in a more conservative funding
market? And how do investors weigh risk when it comes to bets that may
take longer to pull off? For growing startup categories like robotics
and climate, these are not idle questions. We're bringing Sila's Gene
Berdichevsky, Index Ventures' Erin Price-Wright and The Engine's Katie
Rae together to share the real nuts and bolts of early fundraising in
2022.  Sponsored by: LinkedIn It is more important than ever for
marketers to show bang for their buck in today's volatile economy. There
is no cookie-cutter solution to achieve your marketing goals. In this
session hear about some of the tactics B2B startup marketers are
employing to drive demand and pipeline. Learn how you can accelerate
growth by leveraging powerful analytics tools, ad features and your
active professional network.  A common refrain from venture capitalists
last year was that software valuations weren't too high, as the TAM, or
total addressable market, for tech companies was simply larger than
folks had originally thought. Sure, but some of those startups are now
stuck comparing high burn rates with future TAM. So how should founders
and their backers really think about TAM to avoid fooling themselves or
their colleagues? Upfront Ventures' Kara Nortman, Felicis' Aydin Senkut
and Lux Capital's Deena Shakir will tell us. Sure, you no longer have to
be located in Silicon Valley - let alone California - to build a startup
or raise money. But there are still areas where there are more venture
capitalists per square mile and areas where there are fewer. To get to
grips on raising outside of traditional startup hubs, we're bringing
together VCs who either live and invest in - or simply invest in - more
up-and-coming geographies. Mike Asem of M25, Rich Wong of Accel and
Hustle Fund's Elizabeth Yin are joining us for this particular chat.
It's going to rock. Sponsored by: The Aerospace Corporation An
unprecedented decade of growth and investment has carried the space
industry to ever greater heights. Today, the changed funding landscape
and uncertain global economic outlook pose new challenges for space
operators looking to turn their innovative technologies and concepts
into sustainable businesses. We love a competitive startup category here
at TechCrunch. Watching startups go head to head is fascinating and
illuminating. But for startups in hot sectors with big markets,
competing can be very expensive. So how should startups that have
incumbents to take on, other startups to best, or both, approach the
balance between growth and spend this year? We're gathering Anthemis
Partner Ruth Foxe Blader, Ramp co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman and
Airbase founder and CEO Thejo Kote to help guide more early-stage
founders. It is clear by now that the venture market has changed this
year. That means that founders looking to raise first capital for their
startup can't follow last year's playbook and expect results. So what do
founders need to know, and how can they best snag investor attention in
a market where the rules are changing? We're bringing together Annie
Case of Kleiner Perkins, Reach Capital's Jomayra Herrera and Sheel
Mohnot of Better Tomorrow Ventures to share the real nuts and bolts of
early fundraising in 2022. Brex rolled into the corporate card market
with a bang, blanketing San Francisco in advertising and leveraging
small-city network effects to get founders to sign up other founders.
But since its launch, the corporate card space has evolved into the
incredibly competitive corporate spend market. How is Brex working to
stay ahead of its rivals? We'll chat with co-founder and CEO Henrique
Dubugras and one of his backers, Y Combinator's Anu Hariharan, to learn
more. Join us for a live podcast recording of Found, a show about
founders and company-building featuring people doing the work. We'll
interview an early-stage startup founder about how they took the plunge
to begin with, and how they navigate everything from building product
road maps to raising funding from some of the world's top investors -
and how they manage failure, too. Few startups had as much hype - and
early consumer buy-in - as Clubhouse. Since its mega-hit introduction,
however, it has seen its service copied by a host of competitors while
working to expand and fine-tune its model. TechCrunch will sit down with
Clubhouse co-founder and CEO Paul Davison to talk about the company's
past, present and future. It's always a good time to sit down and chat
about the mechanics of term sheets and the give and take between
investors and founders. It's an especially good time now as the balance
of power between founders and investors has shifted from a period in
which founders never had great ability to demand friendly terms to an
era in which it feels like investors have more power than in recent
history. So we'll get the latest from All Raise CEO Mandela SH Dixon,
Techstars Head of Portfolio Capital & Investments Kevin Liu and Black
Operator Ventures General Partner James Norman on term sheets,
negotiations and terms to help founders navigate the current climate.
Companies big and small are figuring out how they are going to
distribute and manage their workforces in 2022. After a few years when
even the most traditional company was forced to go remote, startups are
now having to choose between remote setups, hybrid teams or a return to
the office. But no matter what they choose, all companies are going to
have more remote staff than ever before. To help founders understand how
to manage those staffers, Front's Mathilde Collin, Mural's Adriana Roche
and WorkBoard's Deidre Paknad are joining us to talk about what works.
Metafy is bringing video game coaching to the masses, and it's not only
for gamers who may want to go pro. As digital gaming has become one of
the most important international pastimes, consumers are more willing
than perhaps ever to spend on their hobby. TechCrunch will sit down with
Metafy founder and CEO Josh Fabian and his venture capital backer,
Katelin Holloway of Seven Seven Six, to dig more deeply into the
company, its market and how it is working to grow even faster. From DAOs
and altcoins to L2-chains, NFTs, tokens and figuring out just what the
heck a security is, the crypto market is under the spotlight - and under
scrutiny. TechCrunch will sit down with FTX's Brett Harrison, Uniswap
Labs' Mary-Catherine Lader and Visa's Cuy Sheffield to get a better
handle on how they are navigating constant evolution, the new
opportunities that the blockchain economy has on offer and where they
see the future taking their market. Sponsored by: General Catalyst The
modern workforce is in the middle of one of its biggest shifts since the
industrial revolution. Businesses have encountered the rise of global
talent pools and entirely new sets of jobs and skills needed to grow.
Now, they need to completely rethink how they source, train, equip,
motivate and reward workers. Sponsored by: MoneyGram The "crypto winter"

The rise of incubation advisories and their impact on the early-stage
startup ecosystem

Incubators play a crucial piece in the growth of a startup. In fact, the
number of incubators is considered as a good indicator of how mature a
startup ecosystem is.

Until a few years ago, unless you were a part of the startup ecosystem,
chances are you didn't know what an incubator was. Then came the
extremely popular HBO dramedy Silicon Valley. As Erlich Bachman
incubated Richard Hendricks' Pied Piper to a multi-million dollar
valuation, startup incubation became a globally recognised phenomenon.

Today, incubators are a crucial piece in the startup growth puzzle. The
number of incubators is considered as a good indicator of how mature a
startup ecosystem is.

India, having the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world, has over
500 startup incubators. Even though the country lags behind China
(2,400+ incubators) and the US (1,500+ incubators), the vibrant
ecosystem of startups has paved the way for the third-largest incubation
advisory industry globally, which is gradually gaining popularity.

So, what is an incubator, and what role does it play in the early-stage
startup ecosystem?

Incubators, as the name suggests, 'incubate' disruptive ideas with a
hope of creating a business model and a company, starting often with
even single entrepreneurs. The duration of an incubation programme or
advisory is often long - one to five years in many cases.

The outcome being chased is an innovation, one that survives and
sustains much after the incubation period.

As a startup, you can approach an incubator with just an idea.
Incubators help you refine that idea and build an MVP (Minimum Viable
Product). An incubator is probably the only institution in the startup
ecosystem that comes in at the Pre-Seed or idea stage.

The above is very different from the role and goals of a startup
accelerator, which is a more well-known entity due to names such as
Y-Combinator, Techstars, etc.

A typical accelerator helps in doing 18-24 months of business building
in just a few months, with a clear goal to make the venture VC-funding
ready.

There are other entities that are active in the early-stage ecosystem as
well. For example, a startup studio helps at both ends of the spectrum
(concept to product-market fit) since it also has in-house experts who
can help build and market the product.

Angel investors and Pre-Seed/Seed funds often double up as advisors and
mentors to the founders during the incubation phase.

The silent blossoming of incubators and incubation advisors

Incubators and incubation advisors are experiencing growth in both
demand and supply.

Let's look at supply first. Whether it's the more established
institutional incubators like NASSCOM's 10000 Startups, CIIE IIM-A, and
SINE IIT Bombay or growth in the supply of 'Incubation Advisors'
(Flexingit has seen an 84 percent growth in consultant registrations
during March and April, 2020), incubators are finally coming into their
own in India.

The noble urge to contribute towards innovation that fundamentally
improve the world, the vicarious participation in a disruptive business,
building process, and the desire to be around high-energy founders
wanting to 'make a dent in the universe' - these are some of the reasons
we have heard from incubators and advisors alike, for entering this
space.

Further, exits over the last three-four years, have freed up capital and
mentoring capacity. Then, there has also been a rise of corporates and
family offices in the startup investment and incubation ecosystem.

On the demand side, other than the 'lure of the unicorn status', few
drivers are at play behind the startups that join an incubator or an
incubation programme. These include:

* Huge competition at late seed/Series A stage for financing, talent,
customers, and mentors. For instance, 1,300+ new tech startups were
started in 2019 alone.

* The lower average age of founders and team. In 2015, less than 30
percent of founders in India were above the age of 35, and the remaining
are likely to find value in mentorship and access to business networks
during the incubation phase.

* The need to be around like-minded founders and teams has also been one
of the earliest drivers of demand - more in terms of co-working space.

* Evolution from startups mainly in ecommerce to entry in more and more
niche industries that require deep expertise from Day 1.

From early days, when the business model of incubators was rent and
sales of shared services such as accounting, legal, etc., the rise over
the last few years has thus been driven by more value-added offerings on
one side and intensity of competition among startups on the other.

Why good incubators succeed

Antler, a global early-stage VC, which works more like a structured
incubator, recently entered in India with Rajiv Srivatsa, Co-founder of
Urban Ladder, at its helm.

In the words of Maria Wlosinska, Co-founder of Unlock, one of Antler's
portfolio startups, "Antler puts the whole infrastructure in place.
Whether it's capital, co-founders or mentors. It really helps you to
de-risk". That, in a nutshell, could be the value an incubator brings to
the table.

If building a business is a long marathon, then good incubators prepare
the founders and their team on multiple dimensions of that marathon.

Here are a few ways in which, we think, incubators bring value to
startups in their portfolio;

Mental Stamina and Toughness

This is a hidden factor for success. According to Bill Gross, who
started Idealabs more than 20 years ago, the biggest difference between
startup success and failure is accounted for, by Timing. An incubator
can help in assessing if the timing is right for an idea.

A good incubator goes further. It helps in building and strengthening
the mental stamina (and toughness) required to persevere when the timing
seems round the corner, but not yet there. This hidden success factor is
also essential in preventing founder burnout, which unfortunately is
growing rapidly in the community.

Social Capital

Many of us might have heard the phrase 'It's not what you know, it's who
you know'. Most founders work very hard in building knowledge, but not
as hard in building and maintaining Social Capital.

Mark Granovetter, best known for his work on 'The Strength of Weak
ties', has proven that weak connections play a very important role in an
individual's accomplishments (e.g. 80 percent of time, people find
jobs - and founders their founding teams - through weak connections).

Incubators usually provide the infrastructure - shared office spaces,
where social capital (professional networks) can be built. Good
incubators go beyond that. They impart the know how in building and
strengthening social capital - often an underrated asset, and hence
another hidden factor of success!

Mentors

There are only two kinds of relevant mentors - those with startup
experience and those with industry experience. Many reputed incubators
bring both to the table.

Like Paul Buchheit, the creator of GMail; Brian Chesky, Founder of
AirBnB, are mentors at Y Combinator, most good incubators have mentors
with a prior startup or deep-industry experience.

Other benefits

Domain specific expertise, some sort of financing or access to third
party financing, shared services such as HR, accounting, legal,
marketing execution, etc., are some of the other benefits that
incubators provide.

In structured incubation programmes, there are masterclasses, networking
mixers, and other events that are part of a framework/process to help
the startups learn and apply the learnings in creating a product-market
fit.

Incubation in the time Of COVID-19

The pandemic of COVID-19 is undoubtedly a tragedy of massive
proportions, taking a huge toll on human lives and many livelihoods.
However, like tragedies and recessions in the past, it's also a breeding
ground for new problems that require innovation.

Marc Andreessen recently attributed our current state to the inability
to build enough. This is a big call to action for startups to innovate
and incubators to help them build what can sustain.

It is not easy though. Funding has become tougher, work from home is not
easy for all types of problem-areas and the pandemic along with social
isolation, has taken a huge toll on the mental health of people.

In these tough times, incubators and incubation advisors are seen to be
adopting a different approach to add value to startups. At PurpleCrest,
for instance, we were able to help increase the runway of a B2B venture
by 12 months, through over 40 percent reduction in operating costs when
the pandemic started. We call this the Resilient Growth approach;
growing by using a disruption-proof method.

The approach integrates a resilient mindset,
network/collaboration-powered business model, faster product iteration
cycles, and multiple distribution channels, in the process of
incubation.

The 'Resilient Growth' approach is one of the many approaches that are
likely to emerge in a post-COVID incubation advisory world.

The road ahead

As the startup ecosystem matures in India, incubators and incubation
advisory will more firmly establish its place like elsewhere.

In a world where uncertainty is becoming a norm and recessions are
occurring more frequently, startups are likely to find much-needed
support from these patient advisors.

These advisors and institutions see much less financial success than
other entities in the value chain but likely derive much more
satisfaction from their contribution. And that could also explain the
silence behind the blossoming.

SoftBank: Vision or Delusion?

Phil's Stock World

Aug 24, 2018( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com
Delivered by Newstex) By Guest Post. Originally published at
ValueWalk[1]. Assessing the likelihood of success for the unprecedented
VC giant On October 14, 2016, SoftBank shocked the world with the
announcement of its $100 billion[2] Vision Fund, which would focus on
investing in late-stage technology companies. Within 7 months of the
announcement, SoftBank had already cemented $93 billion [3]in
commitments. To put the unprecedented scale and speed of the Vision Fund
into perspective—it took all US-based venture funds 4 years to raise
$143 billion [4]from 2014 to 2017. Q2 hedge fund letters, conference,
scoops etc[5] In its short history, the Vision-Fund has already led
enormous financing rounds [6]across the globe, from billion dollar plus
investments in ride-sharing services like Uber to a $300 million
investment in Silicon Valley's dog-walking and dog-sitting app, Wag.

[7]In comparison, the median global VC deal size for late-stage
companies was only around $11 million [8]in 2017. The sheer amount of
capital deployed has left the venture capital world stunned, with many
questioning if competitive returns are possible at this massive funding
scale. At EquityZen, we decided to take a step back and analyze what it
would take for the Vision Fund to deliver competitive returns. With this
fund, Masayoshi Son hopes to replicate SoftBank's stellar historical
returns. Through 2017, SoftBank boasts an impressive 44% [9]Internal
Rate of Return ('IRR') over its 18 year history. Though Mr. Son's goal
is to replicate [10]his company's historical returns with this fund,
others claim that the goal is not to produce venture capital returns,
but instead to beat the returns of private equity firms. According to
TechCrunch, investors are expecting to see at least a 20% IRR [11]from
the fund. Our analysis moving forward assumes that the Vision Fund will
generate a 20% IRR on invested equity. Before we dive into our returns
analysis, we should discuss the Vision Fund's rare structure and marquee
investors. Notably, the Vision-Fund is composed of both equity and debt.
As the general partner of the fund, SoftBank has made a $28 billion
[12]commitment, all of which is in equity. The remaining $72 billion[13]
is a mix of debt (~$45 billion[14]) and equity (~$27 billion[15]) and
will come from outside investors. According to the Financial Times,
[16]debt provided by investors will be in the form of preferred units,
which we assume will be paid an annual coupon of 7% over the life of the
fund. The Vision-Fund will have a 5 year [17]investing period with a
minimum fund life of 12 years.[18] Significant debt utilization can
magnify both the potential gains and losses of the fund. On one hand, if
the fund does well, SoftBank will be able to leverage the ~$45 billion
of preferred units to deliver high equity returns to its investors. On
the other hand, if the fund does poorly and returns are less than the 7%
annual coupon, the equity portion of the fund will get nothing. For a
breakdown of individual investor commitments, which include capital from
Apple, Qualcomm and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, among others,
please see below:
https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SoftBank-Vision-1.jpg
Note: Data as of 06/12/2017. SoftBank has since closed the full $100
billion fund [19]with investments from Daimler, Mizuho, and Oracle
co-founder Larry Ellison, among others. Assuming a 20% target IRR, let's
review the methodology and other assumptions we used in sizing up
SoftBank's prospects: SoftBank makes equal capital calls on equity
commitment of $55,360,000,000 in years 1-5. This equates to
$11,072,000,000 a year. SoftBank makes annual 7% interest payments on
$44,640,000,000 debt commitment from years 1-12. This equates to
$3,124,800,000 a year ($37,497,600,000 in total). SoftBank realizes
equal equity returns following the investment period of the fund from
years 6-12, distributing $22,850,345,450 per year ($159,952,418,148 in
total). SoftBank pays back debt principal of $44,640,000,000 at the end
of the fund in year  
https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SoftBank-Vision-2.jpg
If SoftBank meets its 20% hurdle rate on equity, the fund will need to
generate $142 billion1 in investment gain over the life of the Vision
Fund, a value that took Amazon's market cap approximately 16 years
[20]to reach after its IPO. Mr. Son definitely has his work cut out for
him. To put these target returns into perspective, SoftBank will need to
distribute a Spotify-sized company (worth $26.5 billion [21]at time of
IPO in April 2018) for 7 straight years. Or they'll need to match the
GDP of El Salvador[22] every year over the same time period.  
https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SoftBank-Vision-3.jpg
Note: Calculations do not include management fees or performance fees 1.
Interest Payments plus Equity Returns, less Initial Equity Committed
Furthermore, if Mr. Son wants the Vision-Fund to approach SoftBank's
historical returns, the task at hand becomes even more challenging, as
demonstrated below. Assuming a 30% and 40% IRR on Equity, the Vision
Fund would need to realize the market caps of Wells Fargo [23]and
JPMorgan Chase, [24]respectively.  
https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SoftBank-Vision-4.jpg
To take this a step further, we've analyzed the formidable market caps
that some of SoftBank's individual company investments would have to
reach to hit these returns. We selected 10 U.S. based startups with
large financing rounds led by SoftBank and calculated each company's
required exit valuation (assuming an IPO) if each company were to
deliver a 20% IRR on equity to SoftBank and the other investors. Given
it's impossible to predict the exact IPO cadence of these companies, we
assume the following: Each company goes public around year 9 of the fund
(the midpoint between the end of the investing period and the final year
of the fund) No follow-on investments; percent ownership held constant
from financing date and used to imply 'Required Market Cap'

https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SoftBank-Vision-7.jpg
The required market caps become even more gargantuan if we assume that
SoftBank can deliver an IRR on equity of 30% or even 40% in the minimum
fund life of 12 years:  
https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SoftBank-Vision-8.jpg
From an individual investment level, these companies will need to
greatly exceed their current, arguably frothy valuations. For
perspective, if WeWork's current valuation were based on the same
multiple of sales as its closest public competitor, IWG (formerly known
as Regus), WeWork would be worth less than $3 billion, [26]a far cry
from the $144 billion valuation necessary to achieve a 20% IRR. In
reality, the Vision-Fund's success will rest on a few outsized exits
while many of its investments will disappoint. Again, we are assuming
that every company is able to make a 20% IRR independently. However, the
common rule of thumb [27]in the venture capital world is that, given ten
startups, three or four will completely fail, three or four will return
their original investment, and one or two will produce substantial
returns. While it is important to note that SoftBank is specifically
targeting late-stage investments that are less likely [28]to completely
fail, it is safe to assume that not every single investment will produce
competitive returns. In reality, some of SoftBank's investments may
produce no return at all, which would require the few companies that are
successful to achieve even greater market caps than the figures shown
above. Even though investors are looking to only beat private equity
returns, even a 20% IRR will require rapid growth from SoftBank's
portfolio. For reference, top-quartile US buyout funds have been able to
produce IRRs of around 20% - 30% [29]from 2005 - 2016, according
research from Bain ...mpany. If investors are only looking for an IRR of
20%, buyout funds, which target more stable, cash flow positive
businesses, may be a less risky investment than the Vision-Fund's bet on
high growth. This begs the question, why is Mr. Son embarking on this
journey and why is he so confident in his mission? To answer this, we
will need to take a look at Mr. Son's past. Despite the enormous
challenge ahead of him, Masayoshi Son has been an incredibly successful
investor in the past. Mr. Son has been able to deliver outsized returns
before. In 2000, Mr. Son famously invested $20[30] million [31]in Jack
Ma's company, Alibaba. Almost two decades later, SoftBank's remaining
29% stake in the now Chinese conglomerate is worth over $130 billion.
[32]While much of Mr. Son's wealth rests on this one investment, he has
made several other successful investments [33]in companies including
Sprint, Yahoo! and Supercell. However, the question remains if he can
deliver these same past returns at the scale of the Vision-Fund. We
should also remember that, during the dot.com bubble burst, Mr. Son
reportedly lost $70 billion [34]of net worth in one day. However, Mr.
Son seems undaunted by the task as the Vision-Fund has already begun
with an impressive start after Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart in May.
According to the Wall Street[35] Journal, [36]'the Vision Fund has
agreed to sell its $2.5 billion stake in Indian e-commerce company
Flipkart to Walmart for $4 billion.' In a sign of immense confidence,
Mr. Son has even begun to plan a second Vision Fund [37]sometime 'in the
near future.' In the end, the Vision Fund's returns may be a secondary
concern for Son, who is looking to free entrepreneurs from the
constraints of limited capital. Though we'll have to wait another decade
before we can judge the Vision-Fund's performance, we'll likely have to
wait another century before we witness the culmination of SoftBank's
self- proclaimed greater mission: 'Information Revolution - Happiness
for everyone.' [38]Mr. Son has emphasized that he wants to see his
company grow for the next 300 years. [39]With this long-term vision and
massive checkbook, SoftBank is able to give its entrepreneurs the luxury
of asking themselves, '[i]f money was not a constraint, [40]what would
you do differently.' With this mindset, the Vision-Fund has opened the
possibility of a new reality. From the virtual worlds of Improbable
[41]and the development of autonomous machinery at Brain
Corporation[42], to research in oncology at Guardant Health,[43] Mr. Son
is placing huge bets on potentially revolutionary technologies across a
variety of industries. Unprecedented funding levels may enable these
companies to develop and scale at unprecedented speeds. Regardless of
whether SoftBank's portfolio returns billions to its investors or if the
Vision Fund fails to deliver any returns at all, Mr. Son hopes his
efforts will unleash a new frontier of profound technological
advancement in the coming decades. Despite the Vision-Fund'ss admirable
goals, its willingness to deploy capital at a massive scale is arguably
pushing already frothy valuations even higher and crowding out the
competition. According to venture capitalist Megan Quinn [44]of Spark
Capital, SoftBank is changing the rules in Silicon Valley, turning
standard sub-$100 million rounds led by firms like hers into routine
$200 million+ fundraises. NEA and Kleiner Perkins ran into a similar
situation when they were in talks with Wag. Last year, the startup was
in negotiations with these VCs to raise $100 million [45]when the
dog-walking app piqued the interest of SoftBank. SoftBank, however,
would only invest in the company for a minimum $300 million [46]round.
The increased funding size caused investors including NEA and Kleiner
Perkins to drop out [47]of the picture. In addition to Wag, SoftBank has
written several other check sizes larger than most startups have ever
seen. Prior to Brain Corporation's $100+ million[48] funding round led
by SoftBank, the company had only raised a little over $10 million.
[49]Similarly, Improbable had only received $52[50] million [51]in
funding when SoftBank injected a $500 million [52]Series B investment
into the company. SoftBank's checkbook comes as a double-edged sword for
these companies. Yes, these companies are now allowed to dream big and
are much less likely to fail due to lack of funding as SoftBank has
pushed the cost of capital lower. However, overfunding also creates
significant issues of its own. Primarily, these now cash-rich companies
must achieve a certain level of growth to justify their inflated
valuations. This in turn could lead to undisciplined spending of capital
or forced expansion. Furthermore, the hefty sum of cash in the bank may
eliminate the scrappy creativity that many entrepreneurs pride
themselves on while building their businesses. However, these startups
may have little choice as to whether they accept SoftBank's investment.
Companies are left with the fear that if they reject SoftBank, the
Japanese conglomerate will instead invest in rival businesses. Uber's
CEO Dara Khosrowshahi[53] succinctly sums up the experience of working
with SoftBank: '[r]ather than having their capital cannon facing me, I'd
rather have their capital cannon behind me, alright?' In the end, where
does EquityZen fit in? More private capital will continue to delay IPOs,
making a robust secondary market for venture-backed companies
increasingly important. A critical thesis behind EquityZen's formation
stems from a particular trend: companies are staying private longer. The
rise of SoftBank and other mega-funds will likely re-enforce this
phenomenon and increasingly diminish the need for public capital to fund
innovation. It is important to note that the investors in SoftBank's
Vision-Fund and other mega-funds who are able to reap these gains in the
private market are not every-day, retail investors, but rather large
corporations, VCs, private equity funds and other wealthy entities. From
the start, our mission has been to democratize access for all types of
investors to these late-stage private companies while simultaneously
unlocking value for startup employees. SoftBank and its new breed of
investing make our mission more important than ever. Article By Andrew

Assessing the likelihood of success for the unprecedented VC giant On
October 14, 2016, SoftBank shocked the world with the announcement of
its $100 billion[1] Vision Fund, which would focus on investing in
late-stage technology companies. Within 7 months of the announcement,
SoftBank had already cemented $93 billion [2]in commitments. To put the
unprecedented scale and speed of the Vision Fund into perspective—it
took all US-based venture funds 4 years to raise $143 billion [3]from
2014 to 2017. Get Our Icahn eBook! Get our entire 10-part series on Carl

below. NO SPAM EVER Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[4] In
its short history, the Vision-Fund has already led enormous financing
rounds [5]across the globe, from billion dollar plus investments in
ride-sharing services like Uber to a $300 million investment in Silicon
Valley's dog-walking and dog-sitting app, Wag. [6]In comparison, the
median global VC deal size for late-stage companies was only around $11
million [7]in 2017. The sheer amount of capital deployed has left the
venture capital world stunned, with many questioning if competitive
returns are possible at this massive funding scale. At EquityZen, we
decided to take a step back and analyze what it would take for the
Vision Fund to deliver competitive returns. With this fund, Masayoshi
Son hopes to replicate SoftBank's stellar historical returns. Through
2017, SoftBank boasts an impressive 44% [8]Internal Rate of Return
('IRR') over its 18 year history. Though Mr. Son's goal is to replicate
[9]his company's historical returns with this fund, others claim that
the goal is not to produce venture capital returns, but instead to beat
the returns of private equity firms. According to TechCrunch, investors
are expecting to see at least a 20% IRR [10]from the fund. Our analysis
moving forward assumes that the Vision Fund will generate a 20% IRR on
invested equity. Before we dive into our returns analysis, we should
discuss the Vision Fund's rare structure and marquee investors. Notably,
the Vision-Fund is composed of both equity and debt. As the general
partner of the fund, SoftBank has made a $28 billion [11]commitment, all
of which is in equity. The remaining $72 billion[12] is a mix of debt
(~$45 billion[13]) and equity (~$27 billion[14]) and will come from
outside investors. According to the Financial Times, [15]debt provided
by investors will be in the form of preferred units, which we assume
will be paid an annual coupon of 7% over the life of the fund. The
Vision-Fund will have a 5 year [16]investing period with a minimum fund
life of 12 years.[17] Significant debt utilization can magnify both the
potential gains and losses of the fund. On one hand, if the fund does
well, SoftBank will be able to leverage the ~$45 billion of preferred
units to deliver high equity returns to its investors. On the other
hand, if the fund does poorly and returns are less than the 7% annual
coupon, the equity portion of the fund will get nothing. For a breakdown
of individual investor commitments, which include capital from Apple,
Qualcomm and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, among others, please
see below:
https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SoftBank-Vision-1.jpg
Note: Data as of 06/12/2017. SoftBank has since closed the full $100
billion fund [18]with investments from Daimler, Mizuho, and Oracle
co-founder Larry Ellison, among others. Assuming a 20% target IRR, let's
review the methodology and other assumptions we used in sizing up
SoftBank's prospects: SoftBank makes equal capital calls on equity
commitment of $55,360,000,000 in years 1-5. This equates to
$11,072,000,000 a year. SoftBank makes annual 7% interest payments on
$44,640,000,000 debt commitment from years 1-12. This equates to
$3,124,800,000 a year ($37,497,600,000 in total). SoftBank realizes
equal equity returns following the investment period of the fund from
years 6-12, distributing $22,850,345,450 per year ($159,952,418,148 in
total). SoftBank pays back debt principal of $44,640,000,000 at the end
of the fund in year  
https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SoftBank-Vision-2.jpg
If SoftBank meets its 20% hurdle rate on equity, the fund will need to
generate $142 billion1 in investment gain over the life of the Vision
Fund, a value that took Amazon's market cap approximately 16 years
[19]to reach after its IPO. Mr. Son definitely has his work cut out for
him. To put these target returns into perspective, SoftBank will need to
distribute a Spotify-sized company (worth $26.5 billion [20]at time of
IPO in April 2018) for 7 straight years. Or they'll need to match the
GDP of El Salvador[21] every year over the same time period.

Furthermore, if Mr. Son wants the Vision-Fund to approach SoftBank's
historical returns, the task at hand becomes even more challenging, as
demonstrated below. Assuming a 30% and 40% IRR on Equity, the Vision
Fund would need to realize the market caps of Wells Fargo [22]and
JPMorgan Chase, [23]respectively.

To take this a step further, we've analyzed the formidable market caps
that some of SoftBank's individual company investments would have to
reach to hit these returns. We selected 10 U.S. based startups with
large financing rounds led by SoftBank and calculated each company's
required exit valuation (assuming an IPO) if each company were to
deliver a 20% IRR on equity to SoftBank and the other investors. Given
it's impossible to predict the exact IPO cadence of these companies, we

From an individual investment level, these companies will need to
greatly exceed their current, arguably frothy valuations. For
perspective, if WeWork's current valuation were based on the same
multiple of sales as its closest public competitor, IWG (formerly known
as Regus), WeWork would be worth less than $3 billion, [25]a far cry
from the $144 billion valuation necessary to achieve a 20% IRR. In
reality, the Vision-Fund's success will rest on a few outsized exits
while many of its investments will disappoint. Again, we are assuming
that every company is able to make a 20% IRR independently. However, the
common rule of thumb [26]in the venture capital world is that, given ten
startups, three or four will completely fail, three or four will return
their original investment, and one or two will produce substantial
returns. While it is important to note that SoftBank is specifically
targeting late-stage investments that are less likely [27]to completely
fail, it is safe to assume that not every single investment will produce
competitive returns. In reality, some of SoftBank's investments may
produce no return at all, which would require the few companies that are
successful to achieve even greater market caps than the figures shown
above. Even though investors are looking to only beat private equity
returns, even a 20% IRR will require rapid growth from SoftBank's
portfolio. For reference, top-quartile US buyout funds have been able to
produce IRRs of around 20% - 30% [28]from 2005 - 2016, according
research from Bain ...mpany. If investors are only looking for an IRR of
20%, buyout funds, which target more stable, cash flow positive
businesses, may be a less risky investment than the Vision-Fund's bet on
high growth. This begs the question, why is Mr. Son embarking on this
journey and why is he so confident in his mission? To answer this, we
will need to take a look at Mr. Son's past. Despite the enormous
challenge ahead of him, Masayoshi Son has been an incredibly successful
investor in the past. Mr. Son has been able to deliver outsized returns
before. In 2000, Mr. Son famously invested $20[29] million [30]in Jack
Ma's company, Alibaba. Almost two decades later, SoftBank's remaining
29% stake in the now Chinese conglomerate is worth over $130 billion.
[31]While much of Mr. Son's wealth rests on this one investment, he has
made several other successful investments [32]in companies including
Sprint, Yahoo! and Supercell. However, the question remains if he can
deliver these same past returns at the scale of the Vision-Fund. We
should also remember that, during the dot.com bubble burst, Mr. Son
reportedly lost $70 billion [33]of net worth in one day. However, Mr.
Son seems undaunted by the task as the Vision-Fund has already begun
with an impressive start after Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart in May.
According to the Wall Street[34] Journal, [35]'the Vision Fund has
agreed to sell its $2.5 billion stake in Indian e-commerce company
Flipkart to Walmart for $4 billion.' In a sign of immense confidence,
Mr. Son has even begun to plan a second Vision Fund [36]sometime 'in the
near future.' In the end, the Vision Fund's returns may be a secondary
concern for Son, who is looking to free entrepreneurs from the
constraints of limited capital. Though we'll have to wait another decade
before we can judge the Vision-Fund's performance, we'll likely have to
wait another century before we witness the culmination of SoftBank's
self- proclaimed greater mission: 'Information Revolution - Happiness
for everyone.' [37]Mr. Son has emphasized that he wants to see his
company grow for the next 300 years. [38]With this long-term vision and
massive checkbook, SoftBank is able to give its entrepreneurs the luxury
of asking themselves, '[i]f money was not a constraint, [39]what would
you do differently.' With this mindset, the Vision-Fund has opened the
possibility of a new reality. From the virtual worlds of Improbable
[40]and the development of autonomous machinery at Brain
Corporation[41], to research in oncology at Guardant Health,[42] Mr. Son
is placing huge bets on potentially revolutionary technologies across a
variety of industries. Unprecedented funding levels may enable these
companies to develop and scale at unprecedented speeds. Regardless of
whether SoftBank's portfolio returns billions to its investors or if the
Vision Fund fails to deliver any returns at all, Mr. Son hopes his
efforts will unleash a new frontier of profound technological
advancement in the coming decades. Despite the Vision-Fund'ss admirable
goals, its willingness to deploy capital at a massive scale is arguably
pushing already frothy valuations even higher and crowding out the
competition. According to venture capitalist Megan Quinn [43]of Spark
Capital, SoftBank is changing the rules in Silicon Valley, turning
standard sub-$100 million rounds led by firms like hers into routine
$200 million+ fundraises. NEA and Kleiner Perkins ran into a similar
situation when they were in talks with Wag. Last year, the startup was
in negotiations with these VCs to raise $100 million [44]when the
dog-walking app piqued the interest of SoftBank. SoftBank, however,
would only invest in the company for a minimum $300 million [45]round.
The increased funding size caused investors including NEA and Kleiner
Perkins to drop out [46]of the picture. In addition to Wag, SoftBank has
written several other check sizes larger than most startups have ever
seen. Prior to Brain Corporation's $100+ million[47] funding round led
by SoftBank, the company had only raised a little over $10 million.
[48]Similarly, Improbable had only received $52[49] million [50]in
funding when SoftBank injected a $500 million [51]Series B investment
into the company. SoftBank's checkbook comes as a double-edged sword for
these companies. Yes, these companies are now allowed to dream big and
are much less likely to fail due to lack of funding as SoftBank has
pushed the cost of capital lower. However, overfunding also creates
significant issues of its own. Primarily, these now cash-rich companies
must achieve a certain level of growth to justify their inflated
valuations. This in turn could lead to undisciplined spending of capital
or forced expansion. Furthermore, the hefty sum of cash in the bank may
eliminate the scrappy creativity that many entrepreneurs pride
themselves on while building their businesses. However, these startups
may have little choice as to whether they accept SoftBank's investment.
Companies are left with the fear that if they reject SoftBank, the
Japanese conglomerate will instead invest in rival businesses. Uber's
CEO Dara Khosrowshahi[52] succinctly sums up the experience of working
with SoftBank: '[r]ather than having their capital cannon facing me, I'd
rather have their capital cannon behind me, alright?' In the end, where
does EquityZen fit in? More private capital will continue to delay IPOs,
making a robust secondary market for venture-backed companies
increasingly important. A critical thesis behind EquityZen's formation
stems from a particular trend: companies are staying private longer. The
rise of SoftBank and other mega-funds will likely re-enforce this
phenomenon and increasingly diminish the need for public capital to fund
innovation. It is important to note that the investors in SoftBank's
Vision-Fund and other mega-funds who are able to reap these gains in the
private market are not every-day, retail investors, but rather large
corporations, VCs, private equity funds and other wealthy entities. From
the start, our mission has been to democratize access for all types of
investors to these late-stage private companies while simultaneously
unlocking value for startup employees. SoftBank and its new breed of
investing make our mission more important than ever. Article By Andrew

Dear Pro member,

Last week, I had a casual chat with a startup founder in Myanmar, whose
startup ecosystem is in dire straits. The COVID-19 breakout, Feb 2021
coup, and the economic downturn hit startups the hardest. Over 70-80
tech companies have shut down, and the junta is least bothered about
startups.

Feeling neglected and with no way out, local startups and even big IT
companies moved to neighbouring countries, such as Thailand and Vietnam.

I am gathering more details to write a piece about Myanmar's many
problems. If you know someone who can share some details about the
issues faced by the country's startup industry, please let us know.

Separately, we are working on a new feature series for founders to speak
about their failures/failed startups. Some big 'fishes' in the region
have agreed to talk to us about this. Wanna be part of this series?

In today's ER edition, we have many funding stories, Echelon

New Delhi, Aug. 24 -- In your book, you have introduced the market
opportunity navigator-a tool that aids in discovering and evaluating
market opportunities. How can an organization reap benefits from it and
combine it with other business tools? Innovative ideas can be applied to
different market domains and address the needs of different types of
customers.

Think about blockchain as an example. This breakthrough technology can
create value in so many different areas other than financial
transactions. It can be used to create decentralized marketplaces, share
data securely across platforms, create smart contracts, and the list
goes on.

So, whether you are managing a blockchain project in a big company with
deep pockets or in a lean new startup, you must try to map out your
possible markets and applications, and figure out where to play. In
fact, this is the case for almost any type of innovation, and this is
exactly where the market opportunity navigator comes in. It is an
easy-to-apply framework to help you set your strategic focus, turning
this complex choice into a structured and manageable task. Using visual
worksheets, it covers three essential steps to help find the right
markets for your innovation: n generating a set of market opportunities
stemming from the venture's unique abilities n evaluating possible
market opportunities comprehensively, to reveal the most attractive
options n setting a smart strategic focus that will also keep you
open-minded and agile.

The navigator is designed to reinforce and work smoothly with other
common business tools such as the 'business model canvas' and the
'lean-startup methodology'. The wide perspective that it provides adds
an essential level of analysis to the micro-planning of the canvases, so
you can set your strategic boundaries and engage in meaningful lean
cycles of experimentation. What factors should one take into account to
make an informed market choice when identifying potential market
opportunities? Most importantly, managers should look before they leap.
It is very important to take the time, and make this decision carefully.
To do so, start by uncovering potential markets for your innovation.
Having options at hand not only gives you the power of choosing, but
also the power of staying agile. Then work systematically on evaluating
your options-talk with potential users and search for evidence to
support your major assumptions. The goal is to find a market that offers
the highest potential for value creation and, at the same time, the
lowest challenge in capturing this value. Systematic evaluation, like
the one suggested in our tool, can help compare and prioritize different
customer segments, so you can make an informed market choice.

Finally, remember that focusing smartly is not only about choosing a
promising market but also about managing the delicate, yet critical
balance between focus and flexibility. You should consciously keep open
selected markets that can serve as your backup or future growth options.
This allows you to maintain agility over time, and to make sure you do
not get locked into one specific direction. Most established firms see
technological change as a threat, whereas startups see it as a vast
opportunity. How then can established firms use the market opportunity
navigator to recognize opportunities in technology and overcome this
challenge? All companies have to renew themselves to survive, and are
challenged to capture new growth opportunities. They struggle to sustain
their competitiveness and find new fertile grounds. Yet, discovering and
implementing growth endeavors is extremely challenging for established
firms, which are focused more on execution rather than on innovation. To
be able to uncover truly fresh opportunities and utilize new
technologies, companies should adopt explicit processes and frameworks.
Step 1 of the market opportunity navigator offers such a process- it
guides managers how to delink their core abilities from any specific
product they are presently producing, or any specific customer they are
presently addressing. Characterizing these core abilities in 'their own
right' helps managers to search systematically for new market
opportunities and adds new technological capabilities. This process will
not only support them in discovering adjacent market opportunities but
also facilitate the distant search for new opportunities-to overcome the
well-known 'tyranny' of the present markets. As a result of this
process, managers-in large organizations and in small startups- reveal
and map out their landscape of opportunities.

So, before they actually start running, this wide-lens perspective
allows them to make sure they are running in the right direction. How
effective is the market opportunity navigator when an organization has
to define and focus on their target/s in a fast-paced, competitive
environment? Playing in a fast-paced, competitive environment requires
frequent examination of strategy to make sure you are still running in
the right direction. Doubts can arise for many reasons; for example, a
new competitor entering your market, or a new enabling technology.
Whatever the reason may be, you can always go back to the structured
evaluation offered by the market opportunity navigator. You can apply it
to check your new assumptions, support or refute your doubts, and align
your strategy, if necessary. Going back to the navigator whenever you
need to rethink your strategy can show that you are still running in the
right direction, or can help you discover a new direction-if your
analysis indicates that pivoting is preferable. For example, if you come
across a new opportunity that seems interesting, avoid simple
opportunism-evaluate this new opportunity, look at it relative to your
other options, and arrive at an informed decision on whether it is
worthwhile to be pursued, now or later. Could you explain the concept of
'attractiveness map' and its four zones? All market opportunities are
not 'born equal': some are more valuable than others, offering different
levels of challenge in capturing this value. A visual and intuitive way
to distinguish between market opportunities and grasp their differences
is to map them on a simple 2x2 matrix, which we call the attractiveness
map. The Y-axis represents the overall potential of each market
opportunity, and the X-axis represents the overall challenge in
capturing it. This creates four quarters or zones that represent four
types of market opportunities: n quick win: opportunities that are
located in this quarter of the map offer relatively low potential but
also entail low challenge. You can choose to focus on such an option to
increase your sales volume in a relatively safe manner, or simply as a
stepping stone towards a larger and more challenging opportunity in the
future.

Tesla chose such a strategy when focusing first on the high-end electric
sports car, as a stepping stone towards an affordable electric car for
the masses. n gold mine: gold mines are rare opportunities that promise
high potential with a relatively low challenge.

Uncovering a gold mine is usually the result of identifying a
significant need in the market that no one has been aware of before
(think about Facebook, for example), or of developing an extremely
powerful capability that no other company has. If you have a gold mine
opportunity in your map, then you should definitely focus on pursuing
it.

n moon shot: just like the name, moon shot opportunities promise you
tremendous potential, but are extremely challenging. In the risk-return
analogy, these are high riskhigh return options. Breakthrough ideas
often fall in this quarter of the map (innovative drug development is
one clear example). Choosing to focus on a moon shot means that you
accept the entailed risk and that you are ready for the long ride, for a
hopefully rewarding end.

n questionable: questionable opportunities offer a challenging climb
towards a relatively low reward. Companies should avoid pursuing
questionable opportunities, yet the number one reason for startups'
failure is putting too much in developing an offer that no one really
needs. So, if you invest time and effort in researching and validating
your target markets before pursuing them, then you just might save
yourself from focusing on questionable options. While estimating the
potential and challenge of your market opportunities requires a great
deal of attention, it will help to differentiate between your options
and be fully aware of their upsides and downsides before choosing where
to play.

How can market opportunities be shaped? Identifying and shaping new
market opportunities is a creative task, but you can apply systematic
frameworks to enhance this creative discovery. The first step of the
market opportunity navigator offers such a structured framework.

The process begins with getting a good understanding of your unique
abilities or your core technologies, to understand what properties they
have and what functions they can perform. Once done, it is time to think
about them creatively, perhaps recombine them in different manners, in
order to identify possible applications. An application means a specific
usage or job, which you can fulfill with your core abilities. For
example, Google Glass- the smart eyewear developed by Google X Labs.
This wearable computer had several unique technological elements,
including eye-tap technology, voice control, smart prism projector, and
augmented reality abilities. Although the device was officially pulled
from the market in early 2015, the unique abilities of Google Glass
could actually serve many different applications, other than
consumers-for medical purposes, educational purposes, media
applications, to name a few. As you uncover potential applications, also
consider who may have the need for them. These will create your possible
sets of customers. Eventually, a market opportunity is any combination
of application and customers. For example, medical applications of the
smart glasses include use by different types of surgeons during
interventional procedures, by doctors and nurses during clinical
examination, and by trainers and medical students. Each one of these
customer groups can turn into an interesting market opportunity.
Overall, the structured logic of this process helps managers identify,
shape, and define new market opportunities in a clear manner.

How can an organization depict its strategy and communicate it using the
'agile focus dartboard'? How can the 'agile focus strategy' assure that
companies maintain a focus and deliberately keep open other viable
market opportunities? Setting a smart strategic focus is more than just
choosing the most promising market opportunities to pursue. It is also
about managing the delicate balance between focus and flexibility.
Companies-large and small-must stay agile and open to adaptation and
change if they want to win the game. To do so, you will need to set your
agile focus strategy-clearly define the market opportunity that you will
pursue now, but also the opportunities you will keep open for backup or
future growth. Keeping an option open means that you presently invest
very little resources and management attention in it, just to make sure
not to lock yourself out of it. This will help you maintain your
flexibility while staying focused. To clearly communicate this strategy,
you can depict it on the agile focus dartboard:

place your primary market opportunities at the centre, the options that
you keep open in the surrounding square, and the opportunities that you
place in storage (ie, disregard at this stage) on the outskirts. How can
startups design an agile focus strategy? At first, agile focus seems
like an oxymoron, but a deeper observation reveals not only that this is
possible, but also that it can be extremely beneficial if done right.
Here is how you can design your agile focus strategy, in three clear
steps:

n Identify additional market opportunities that could be suitable as
your backup or growth options. A backup option is one that you will want
to pursue if you are not successful with your present opportunity. A
growth option is a market opportunity that you will want to pursue once
you are successful with your present opportunity.

n Evaluate the relatedness of these possible options to the markets you
are presently pursuing. Relatedness means that developing and delivering
the product-for both markets-require relatively similar resources and
capabilities. The more related an option is, the more you can leverage
your existing competencies to succeed in it. And this is exactly what we
want. n Pick at least one backup and one growth option to keep open.
Keep them in mind when you develop your venture's unique abilities,
resources and networks, to make sure you do not get locked into one
specific direction. What are the pros and cons involved when an
organization focuses only on one market opportunity (primary
opportunity)? Large organizations can build a portfolio of products, and
play simultaneously in several market domains. However, startups are
extremely scarce on resources-both human and financial-and must not
spread them too thinly.

Therefore, it is important for startups to choose one market opportunity
as their primary focus. In rare cases, however, it may be beneficial for
small companies to pursue more than one target market simultaneously.
This may be the case if your primary market is highly uncertain and
risky, and if you have options at hand that are tightly related, so you
can leverage the same resources and capabilities to succeed in both.

As an example for such parallel strategy, consider Camero, a leading
provider and pioneer of through- wall-imaging solutions. Their products
provide real-time observation of stationary and moving objects concealed
behind walls or barriers. This revolutionary solution is suitable for
intelligence and tactical applications needed by both military troops
and law enforcement officers.

While both markets had large potential, the main challenge was in
accessing these customers and in bearing the very long, complex sales
process. To balance this risk, Camero's managers decided to pursue these
two markets simultaneously: military and police. The products they
required were similar, and the markets were tightly related, as they
were both leaning on government budgets and sharing the same values and
word of mouth. This tight relatedness enabled Camero to pursue a
parallel strategy, to increase their value and mitigate their risk with
minimum effort.

Guidelines on evaluating market opportunities... An attractive market is
one that will likely produce a significant potential for value creation
and that poses manageable challenges in capturing that value. To
estimate the potential of an opportunity, check if your offering creates
a compelling reason to buy for a significant set of customers, who will
be able and are willing to pay for it. To estimate the challenge in
pursuing an opportunity, understand the difficulties in developing and
delivering your offering and the risks associated with your business
environment. Assess whether they are manageable and if you can overcome
them in a reasonable time frame. To evaluate these parameters, adopt a
learning mindset-start with setting your hypotheses or beliefs about
your markets, and then strive to turn your critical assumptions into
knowledge. Perform desk research-get some figures on the size of the
market and the competitive threat you might face, but also make sure to
'go out of the building' and talk with potential customers and market
experts, to make sure that they really need and want what you have to
offer. Step 2 of the market opportunity navigator offers a structured
process to help you perform a comprehensive evaluation without
overlooking any important factors. The systematic approach also enables
you to compare different market opportunities and to make an informed
strategic choice on where to play.

Why e27 Pro member Incubate Fund remains optimistic about the startup
ecosystem in Japan

Sep 01, 2020( e27: http://www.e27.sg Delivered by Newstex) ; The largest
early stage focused venture capital firm in Japan, Incubate Fund, is
ranked within the top five best consistent performance venture capital
firms globally in Preqin Private Capital Performance Update: 4Q2018[1].
Sometimes misunderstood for an incubator or accelerator, Principal Dave
Kwong said, the idea of 'Incubate' in Incubate Fund[2] is that they
always strive to be the first investor in their portfolio companies and
'incubate' them from a small team to become a large reputable company.
e27 chatted with Kwong to know their funds, philosophy, and portfolio in
detail in our latest webinar. What is your investment philosophy? We are
a thesis-driven early stage focussed investor as opposed to
spray-and-pray; hence we spend much of our time doing research and
discussing business models ideas internally.

We usually have a vivid image of the exact business model in the
respective sector which we want to invest in, and we actually have a
list of business models that we discuss internally as a team multiple
times in a month. This extensive preparation helps us with our efficacy
in deal sourcing and identifying the right founders to invest. Speed is
essential for an early stage VC[3], and we hope that our focus and
preparation help with speed and accuracy. Our GPs schedule weekly calls
with their portfolio companies and spend the bulk of their time doing
portfolio management.We found weekly calls to be more helpful as the
agenda is always fresh and actionable tasks can be updated quickly. We
also remain mindful not to overstep and micromanage the founders.
Sometimes being founders can get lonely, and it may be comforting to
some of them who are just looking to routinely talk to someone who has
been with them through every part of the journey. There is a case where
the founder continues to have regular meetings or calls with one of our
GP up until the week they went public. Also Read:HostelHunting raises
US$500K from KK Fund, Incubate Fund, Cradle Fund[4] Explain your current
funds in detail? What's your average ticket size? Incubate Fund
currently has four flagship funds in Japan, Incubate Fund India has been
investing actively from its second fund, and Incubate Fund-US is also
actively looking for investments in San Francisco. Incubate Fund India
and Incubate Fund US operate independently from Japan, by GPs who are
living in Bangalore and San Francisco respectively, with active support
and participation from our team in Japan and Singapore. All our funds
are focused on investing in seed stage startups[5]. We started off in
Japan with a JPY2.8 billion fund (approx. US$26 million) in 2010, and by
Fund 3 (2014 Vintage) and 4 (2017 Vintage), our fund performance has
helped us garnered enough interest from Limited Partners to close JPY110
Billion (approx. US$100M) for Fund 3 and 4 each. Incubate Fund India and
Incubate Fund US are around US$20-30 million in size as they are still
relatively new funds. Given the market size, we will not be surprised if
the Asia (ex. Japan) and US operations will each surpass Japan in the
future. We also have a JPY6.9 billion (approx. US$63 million) Fund of
Fund vehicle in Japan called IFLP. This fund has invested into many new
GPs with unique theses and deal sourcing capabilities who are starting
their first funds in Japan. In a sense, Incubate Fund not only helps get
startups moving, but we are also trying to build a healthy funding
ecosystem by helping new VCs get started. Are there any specific
sectors, industries, regions or funding stages that you are focussed on?
We are mostly sector-agnostic, but our investment themes vary across
geographies.In Japan, we have moved on from investments in mobile
internet, marketplaces, and media/entertainment in our earlier funds and
gradually move our focus to digital transformation innovations,
deep-tech, and frontier tech. Also Read:Incubate Fund's Masahiko Honma
on silliness, missed deals and investing funda[6] We have invested in
space tech companies such as iSpace, medtech companies such as AI
Medical, and wave control technology companies such as Pixie Dust
Technologies in recent years. In India and Southeast Asia, our
hypothesis is that there are still ample opportunities in B2B[7] and B2C
sectors where we were targeting in Japan five to 10 years ago. In the
US, we are focussed on B2B and digital marketing innovations. Can you
shed more light on your growing involvement in Japan and the startup
ecosystem there? The Japanese startup ecosystem is like a black hole in
East Asia. People know more about China and South Korea's startup
ecosystem but overlook the startups coming from the world's
third-largest economy. Due to the lack of information on the ecosystem,
most people infer that the startup scene in Japan is not vibrant.
However, it is and has been growing over the last few years. From 2017
to 2019, there have been 243 funds established, and the total startup
funding amount has reached JPY1.22 trillion (approx. US$11.2 billion)
funding 6,780 startups in the same period. There are 48, 46, and 42
startup IPOs in Japan in 2017, 2018, 2019 respectively. In 2019, there
have also been 52 M&#38;A exits for startups in Japan. There is still
much room to grow in Japan, especially when Japan's GDP/VC Investment
Ratio is only 0.03 per cent as compared to South Korea which is 0.083
per cent and US which is 0.4 per cent. There are many excellent
engineers in Japan and Incubate Fund's current strategy is to utilise
technology to create new industries and transform existing industries
with talented teams. What are the qualities that you look for in a
founder/startup or potential investment? Any singular most important
trait? In terms of tangible qualities, I like to look for founders who
have relevant experience and insights in the industry they are
targeting. We also started to realise that the founders in Incubate Fund
India's portfolio are gradually averaging around middle age. I am a
relatively young venture capitalist, and it is always humbling to learn
from founders and grow.However, as the VC becomes more experienced, then
they will have way more knowledge to give founders, and that is when VCs
may find themselves more comfortable to invest in younger founders and
coach them. Optimism is an important trait[8]; it is what allows
founders to come up with seemingly outrageous ideas and just run with
it. However, it is a double-edged sword and may affect how founders
drive decisions and leave blind spots when they least expect. Also, as
an early-stage investor, investing in a grateful founder would also mean
that they still value your presence and voice even when their startup
becomes a unicorn. What are the three most common traits in your current
portfolio companies? The first trait is that the founders in our
portfolio companies are passionate about what they are building and the
mission. The secondtrait is that the founding team has at least one
member who has experience in the field they are targeting. This has now
become more important for our investment themes in Japan, India, SEA,
and US portfolio companies. Also Read: Monk's Hill Ventures's Peng T.
Ong on how to get your startup ready for the new normal[9] The third
trait is that our portfolio companies are always testing product-market
fit and making sure the business model works during the early stages. We
always encourage our portfolio companies to target for sustainable
growth, as opposed to growth at all cost. Personally, I always advocate
for survivability, if the company survives then it can fight for another
day then there will still be a chance that things will turn around. If
it cannot survive, then the company will liquidate, and we will never
know what happens if we have the chance to fight for another day. Catch

Space industry and travel predictions for 2020

In 2019, the U.S. Space Force was formally established, NASA received a
2024 deadline for returning Americans to the moon, and private companies
the world over raised billions of dollars for everything from rockets to
antennas. This year shows no signs of a let-up in space-sector momentum.
Here are 20 predictions for 2020 as seen by SpaceNews reporters and
correspondents.

1. Suborbital space tourism finally arrives

After years of delays, the two leading companies in suborbital human
spaceflight may finally enter commercial operations. Virgin Galactic
plans to move VSS Unity, its SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane, to
Spaceport America in New Mexico early in the year for a final series of
test flights. The company, which became publicly traded in October, said
in filings it expects to begin tourism flights by June. Blue Origin said
in early 2019 it expected to start crewed test flights of its New
Shepard suborbital vehicle by the end of the year, but executives later
said it wanted to perform a few more test flights without people on
board first. The company has yet to disclose details regarding when
people will start flying commercially on the vehicle, and for what
price.

2. A flotilla of Mars missions takes off

As many as four Mars missions are scheduled to launch this year. The
most ambitious mission is NASA's Mars 2020 rover, which will collect
samples for return to Earth on a pair of missions in the latter half of
the 2020s in cooperation with ESA. The biggest questions, though,
surround ESA's own ExoMars 2020 mission, which has suffered problems
with its parachutes. A key set of tests early in the year will determine
if the mission can launch on a Russian Proton rocket this summer or if
it will have to wait until 2022. China is planning its first Mars
mission that will include an orbiter as well as a lander and rover. The
United Arab Emirates will launch its first planetary mission, a Mars
orbiter called Hope, on a Japanese H-2A rocket. Assuming they launch on
schedule, all the spacecraft will reach Mars in early 2021.

3. Angara 5 returns

After a five-year gap, Russia's Angara 5 rocket is scheduled to resume
flights in 2020. Russia launched the first and so far only Angara 5
mission in December 2014 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. ILS Chief
Technology Officer Jim Kramer said in December that two Angara 5
missions are planned for this year. Both are Russian government
missions. Angara 5 is Russia's successor to Proton, the country's
flagship heavy lift vehicle. A launchpad for Angara 5 at Russia's new
Vostochny Cosmodrome is expected to be ready in 2023.

4. FCC prepares to run public C-band auction

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided in November to run
its own auction of satellite C-band spectrum instead of letting
satellite operators handle it. Giulia McHenry, the acting chief of the
FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics, said days later that the
commission was "confident we can commence this auction before the end of
2020." The FCC has emphasized a desire for speed in transferring 280
megahertz of C-band spectrum for use in 5G cellular networks. How
satellite operators currently using American C-band, notably Intelsat,
SES, Telesat, and Eutelsat, will transition out of the spectrum is not
yet clear.

5. Winners get picked for U.S. National Security Space Launch program

The big four in the U.S. launch industry - United Launch Alliance,
SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman - hope to be one of two
providers that will receive five-year contracts later this year to
launch national security payloads starting in 2022. ULA, Blue Origin,
and Northrop Grumman are pitching newly designed vehicles for the
competition, all projected to fly for the first time in 2021. "That
means we'll be doing final development and production of first-flight
hardware in 2020," Col. Robert Bongiovi, director of the Space and
Missile Systems Center's launch enterprise, said in December.

6. Satellite servicing and debris retrieval missions move forward

Spacecraft will demonstrate their ability to move satellites to new
orbits and clean up orbital debris. Northrop Grumman's Mission Extension
Vehicle-1, launched in October, is scheduled to dock with Intelsat-901
in early 2020 to extend the life of the communications satellite. Also
in 2020, Swiss startup Clearspace plans to begin leading a European
consortium focused on capturing a Vespa payload adapter in 2025 and
dragging it into Earth's atmosphere.

7. OneWeb and SpaceX begin major constellation deployments

The two leading mega constellation companies project a rapid increase in
launches, enough to begin partial service offering internet access from
low Earth orbit later this year. OneWeb launched 34 small broadband
satellites on a Soyuz rocket in February, kicking off regular launch
campaigns as it builds toward an initial constellation of 650
satellites. SpaceX, having conducted five dedicated Starlink launches so
far, projects two dozen such launches this year. If each mission carries
60 satellites, SpaceX could have well over 1,000 satellites in orbit by
year's end.

8. NRO commercial imagery buys accelerate

The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office in 2019 awarded contracts to
multiple commercial imagery providers as it seeks to bring new
geospatial data suppliers into the national security overhead
architecture. NRO officials said 2020 could be a pivotal year as the
agency considers awarding larger procurement contracts to commercial
players like Planet and BlackSky that are seeking a piece of the market
now dominated by Maxar Technologies, which owns DigitalGlobe.

9. SpaceX will more than double its launch pace

The Dec. 16 launch of the JCSAT-18/Kacific-1 communications satellite
was SpaceX's last mission of 2019, a slower than an expected year with
13 launches - 11 fewer than the company had projected. SpaceX President
and COO Gwynne Shotwell said the forecast for 2020 is 35 to 38 launches.
That includes 15 to 24 Starlink missions as the company grows its
broadband constellation. Shotwell told reporters Dec. 6, "you should see
a mission every two to three weeks."

10. China's launch rate stays high

China expects to conduct more than 40 launches this year, including
flights of its most powerful rocket, the Long March 5. Missions on
China's manifest include launching Beidou navigation satellites, a
mission to Mars, and a lunar sample return mission. China completed 34
orbital launches last year, and 37 in 2018 - the first year it surpassed
the U.S. and Russia in launches.

11. Telesat to choose LEO constellation builder

Telesat Canada was planning to pick a manufacturing partner to build
some or all of its 300-satellite constellation last year, but that was
before a competing team split up. Maxar Technologies and Thales Alenia
Space were vying together for the $3 billion contracts until late last
year, when the two parted ways, citing disagreement over the size,
scope, and financial metrics of their partnership. Those companies are
now competing separately against Airbus Defence and Space to build
Telesat LEO, a constellation Telesat hopes to have fully in orbit in
2023.

12. New small launch vehicles enter the market

Several companies working on small launch vehicles will likely attempt
their first launches in 2020. Virgin Orbit announced in December its
first orbital launch attempt was "imminent" and would take place after a
final series of tests of its converted Boeing 747 with the LauncherOne
rocket attached. Firefly Aerospace will soon begin static-fire tests of
the first stage of its Alpha rocket, with a first launch later this year
from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Other companies, like ABL
Space Systems, Relativity Space, and Stealth Space Company (aka Astra
Space) will at least make progress toward a first launch, as the
industry awaits a long-anticipated shakeout among the dozens of
companies that have announced plans to build small launchers.

13. Data Fusion becomes the norm for Earth observation

Electro-optical, synthetic aperture radar and radiofrequency data will
be combined with information drawn from airborne and terrestrial sensors
as well as social network feed to create new data products for
customers. During the 2010s, companies proved they could capture data
with increasing frequency and spatial resolution. Data fusion will be a
watchword of the 2020s.

14. Space startups find it harder to raise money

Recent space startup failures, including Vector Space Systems, Audacy,
and LeoSat, will make investors more cautious in their approach to space
sector investment in 2020. That is not to say that private capital will
dry up. Far from it. Many investors will continue to seek space-related
investment. However, companies in some of the overcrowded sectors, like
small satellite launch, may find it harder to raise additional funding.

15. Maiden flights of Ariane 6 and Vega C

Both of Europe's next-generation launch vehicles, the heavy-lift Ariane
6 and light lift Vega C, are scheduled for first flight in 2020.
Arianespace is conducting both missions, Ariane 6 with 30 small
broadband satellites for OneWeb, and Vega C with the Italian Space
Agency's Lares-2 science mission. Ariane 6 is designed to cost 40% to
50% less than the Ariane 5, and Vega C is designed to lift around 700
kilograms more than Vega to low Earth orbit. Exact launch dates for the
new launchers have not yet been announced.

16. Flexible communications satellites reign supreme

Satellite manufacturers have used the past few years of slow sales to
invest in high-throughput technologies that offer more capacity and the
ability to better control where that capacity goes. Manufacturers say
the ability to offer "flexible" communications satellites that can
adjust the power, shape, and position of their beams is now the de facto
standard to do business. Airbus, Thales Alenia Space, and Boeing all
rolled out new flexible satellite lines last year. Satellite operators
discussing their future satellite plans now stress the importance of
flexibility, as evidenced by Inmarsat's purchase of three OneSat
satellites from Airbus last year, and SES's purchase of seven O3b mPower
satellites from Boeing in 2018.

17. Artemis makes progress

NASA ended 2019 getting most, but not all, of what it asked for in
additional funding for the Artemis program to return humans to the moon
by 2024. The agency will likely award initial contracts for lunar lander
development early in the year, but the funding shortfall that effort
received - $600 million versus a request of $1 billion for fiscal year
2020 - could mean fewer companies will win contracts. Other major
milestones for Artemis include completion of environmental testing of
the Orion spacecraft at NASA's Plum Brook Station in the spring and a
"Green Run" static-fire test of the Space Launch System core stage at
the Stennis Space Center later in the year. However, a first flight of
the SLS, an uncrewed mission called Artemis-1, is unlikely to take place
before early 2021. In Washington, NASA is expected to reveal just how
much that first phase of the Artemis program, through a 2024 landing,
will cost, a figure that could cause sticker shock among some in
Congress.

18. Signals intelligence from space takes off

Companies planning constellations to detect radiofrequency signals from
space all have important launches in 2020. HawkEye 360, which has three
satellites in orbit, plans to launch another trio later this year on an
Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. France-based UnseenLabs said in
September it anticipates launching six more satellites in 2020 following
the successful launch of its first satellite on a Rocket Lab Electron in
August. And Luxembourg-based Kleos Space, having last year traded Rocket
Lab's Electron for rideshare on an Indian PSLV, anticipates launching
its "Scouting Mission" on the Indian space agency ISRO's next mission
with the rocket.

19. Commercial crew test flights take place

Both Boeing and SpaceX performed uncrewed test flights of their
commercial crew vehicles in 2019, setting the stage for crewed test
flights in the coming year. NASA has yet to set dates for either
SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 or Boeing's CST100 Starliner Crew Test
Flight missions, although SpaceX CEO Elon Musk suggested in late
December his company's flight might take place around the middle of the
year, after an inflight abort test in January and final NASA safety
reviews. NASA is counting on at least one company being able to enter
service this year but is negotiating with the Russian space agency
Roscosmos for additional Soyuz seats, just in case.

20. Commercial alternatives surface to NASA's Tracking and Data Relay
Satellite System

The increasing human and robotic space activity in low Earth orbit will
prompt government agencies and commercial firms to invest in networks to
relay communications to and from the ground. In 2020, Solstar Space Co.
plans to upgrade transceivers to offer Wi-Fi to people and machines in
orbit. Addvalue Innovation, a subsidiary of Addvalue Technologies, plans
to expand production and delivery of Inter-satellite Data Relay System
terminals, which it developed with satellite fleet operator Inmarsat. In
addition, NASA's Space Communications and Navigation program office will
work to establish public-private partnerships aimed at creating
resilient communications and navigation networks. spacenews.com

In 2019, the U.S. Space Force was formally established, NASA received a
2024 deadline for returning Americans to the moon, and private companies
the world over raised billions of dollars for everything from rockets to
antennas. This year shows no signs of a let-up in space-sector momentum.
Here are 20 predictions for 2020 as seen by SpaceNews reporters and
correspondents.

1. Suborbital space tourism finally arrives

After years of delays, the two leading companies in suborbital human
spaceflight may finally enter commercial operations. Virgin Galactic
plans to move VSS Unity, its SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane, to
Spaceport America in New Mexico early in the year for a final series of
test flights. The company, which became publicly traded in October, said
in filings it expects to begin tourism flights by June. Blue Origin said
in early 2019 it expected to start crewed test flights of its New
Shepard suborbital vehicle by the end of the year, but executives later
said it wanted to perform a few more test flights without people on
board first. The company has yet to disclose details regarding when
people will start flying commercially on the vehicle, and for what
price.

2. A flotilla of Mars missions takes off

As many as four Mars missions are scheduled to launch this year. The
most ambitious mission is NASA's Mars 2020 rover, which will collect
samples for return to Earth on a pair of missions in the latter half of
the 2020s in cooperation with ESA. The biggest questions, though,
surround ESA's own ExoMars 2020 mission, which has suffered problems
with its parachutes. A key set of tests early in the year will determine
if the mission can launch on a Russian Proton rocket this summer or if
it will have to wait until 2022. China is planning its first Mars
mission that will include an orbiter as well as a lander and rover. The
United Arab Emirates will launch its first planetary mission, a Mars
orbiter called Hope, on a Japanese H-2A rocket. Assuming they launch on
schedule, all the spacecraft will reach Mars in early 2021.

3. Angara 5 returns

After a five-year gap, Russia's Angara 5 rocket is scheduled to resume
flights in 2020. Russia launched the first and so far only Angara 5
mission in December 2014 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. ILS Chief
Technology Officer Jim Kramer said in December that two Angara 5
missions are planned for this year. Both are Russian government
missions. Angara 5 is Russia's successor to Proton, the country's
flagship heavy lift vehicle. A launchpad for Angara 5 at Russia's new
Vostochny Cosmodrome is expected to be ready in 2023.

4. FCC prepares to run public C-band auction

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided in November to run
its own auction of satellite C-band spectrum instead of letting
satellite operators handle it. Giulia McHenry, the acting chief of the
FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics, said days later that the
commission was "confident we can commence this auction before the end of
2020." The FCC has emphasized a desire for speed in transferring 280
megahertz of C-band spectrum for use in 5G cellular networks. How
satellite operators currently using American C-band, notably Intelsat,
SES, Telesat, and Eutelsat, will transition out of the spectrum is not
yet clear.

5. Winners get picked for U.S. National Security Space Launch program

The big four in the U.S. launch industry - United Launch Alliance,
SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman - hope to be one of two
providers that will receive five-year contracts later this year to
launch national security payloads starting in 2022. ULA, Blue Origin,
and Northrop Grumman are pitching newly designed vehicles for the
competition, all projected to fly for the first time in 2021. "That
means we'll be doing final development and production of first-flight
hardware in 2020," Col. Robert Bongiovi, director of the Space and
Missile Systems Center's launch enterprise, said in December.

6. Satellite servicing and debris retrieval missions move forward

Spacecraft will demonstrate their ability to move satellites to new
orbits and clean up orbital debris. Northrop Grumman's Mission Extension
Vehicle-1, launched in October, is scheduled to dock with Intelsat-901
in early 2020 to extend the life of the communications satellite. Also
in 2020, Swiss startup Clearspace plans to begin leading a European
consortium focused on capturing a Vespa payload adapter in 2025 and
dragging it into Earth's atmosphere.

7. OneWeb and SpaceX begin major constellation deployments

The two leading mega constellation companies project a rapid increase in
launches, enough to begin partial service offering internet access from
low Earth orbit later this year. OneWeb launched 34 small broadband
satellites on a Soyuz rocket in February, kicking off regular launch
campaigns as it builds toward an initial constellation of 650
satellites. SpaceX, having conducted five dedicated Starlink launches so
far, projects two dozen such launches this year. If each mission carries
60 satellites, SpaceX could have well over 1,000 satellites in orbit by
year's end.

8. NRO commercial imagery buys accelerate

The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office in 2019 awarded contracts to
multiple commercial imagery providers as it seeks to bring new
geospatial data suppliers into the national security overhead
architecture. NRO officials said 2020 could be a pivotal year as the
agency considers awarding larger procurement contracts to commercial
players like Planet and BlackSky that are seeking a piece of the market
now dominated by Maxar Technologies, which owns DigitalGlobe.

9. SpaceX will more than double its launch pace

The Dec. 16 launch of the JCSAT-18/Kacific-1 communications satellite
was SpaceX's last mission of 2019, a slower than an expected year with
13 launches - 11 fewer than the company had projected. SpaceX President
and COO Gwynne Shotwell said the forecast for 2020 is 35 to 38 launches.
That includes 15 to 24 Starlink missions as the company grows its
broadband constellation. Shotwell told reporters Dec. 6, "you should see
a mission every two to three weeks."

10. China's launch rate stays high

China expects to conduct more than 40 launches this year, including
flights of its most powerful rocket, the Long March 5. Missions on
China's manifest include launching Beidou navigation satellites, a
mission to Mars, and a lunar sample return mission. China completed 34
orbital launches last year, and 37 in 2018 - the first year it surpassed
the U.S. and Russia in launches.

11. Telesat to choose LEO constellation builder

Telesat Canada was planning to pick a manufacturing partner to build
some or all of its 300-satellite constellation last year, but that was
before a competing team split up. Maxar Technologies and Thales Alenia
Space were vying together for the $3 billion contracts until late last
year, when the two parted ways, citing disagreement over the size,
scope, and financial metrics of their partnership. Those companies are
now competing separately against Airbus Defence and Space to build
Telesat LEO, a constellation Telesat hopes to have fully in orbit in
2023.

12. New small launch vehicles enter the market

Several companies working on small launch vehicles will likely attempt
their first launches in 2020. Virgin Orbit announced in December its
first orbital launch attempt was "imminent" and would take place after a
final series of tests of its converted Boeing 747 with the LauncherOne
rocket attached. Firefly Aerospace will soon begin static-fire tests of
the first stage of its Alpha rocket, with a first launch later this year
from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Other companies, like ABL
Space Systems, Relativity Space, and Stealth Space Company (aka Astra
Space) will at least make progress toward a first launch, as the
industry awaits a long-anticipated shakeout among the dozens of
companies that have announced plans to build small launchers.

13. Data Fusion becomes the norm for Earth observation

Electro-optical, synthetic aperture radar and radiofrequency data will
be combined with information drawn from airborne and terrestrial sensors
as well as social network feed to create new data products for
customers. During the 2010s, companies proved they could capture data
with increasing frequency and spatial resolution. Data fusion will be a
watchword of the 2020s.

14. Space startups find it harder to raise money

Recent space startup failures, including Vector Space Systems, Audacy,

Arianespace is conducting both missions, Ariane 6 with 30 small

Agency's Lares-2 science mission. Ariane 6 is designed to cost 40% to
50% less than the Ariane 5, and Vega C is designed to lift around 700
kilograms more than Vega to low Earth orbit. Exact launch dates for the
new launchers have not yet been announced.

Let's understand how champion companies work: Hariom Rai, Lava

Voice & Data

At the Telecom Leadership Forum 2022, Hariom Rai, Chairman and MD, Lava
International Ltd, presented a talk on the challenges Indian companies
face today, and how to over come. His talk was on the key to unlock
India's potential.

Holistically, how is India going to progress from power to wealth. If we
understand the fundamentals, things become very simple. If we can deploy
that into any other sector, it is going to work similarly, but right
now, I'm going to speak in context of electronics.

So, what is the big picture? Let's understand first, so, Bharat has had
5,000 years of economic dominance. We were 25% of the global GDP, when
the Britishers came, they brought the GDP down. When they left us in
1947, with 3.9% of the global GDP, what we have done in the last 75 odd
years has brought us further down to 3.1% of global GDP.

First, and the most important thing for us is to understand that
whatever we have done with the country, it has not served us well. Let
us also look at it from the different context. We were really left
behind when the whole of Asia kept progressing. We were almost similar
in 1960s, when the per capita income for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and
India, were almost similar. Japan was a little ahead, but was almost
similar. Look at what happened to us and where we are.

We were not been able to progress. Let's try to unlock as to why it
happened. Let's first understand the process of growth. Finally, whether
it is a family, or a company, or a country. Finally, when you are at a
low level of stage, or, the issue is in the knowledge and skills, that's
all whether it's an individual or a family or a country.

Stage one for a developing country - it lacks knowledge and skills. What
needs to be done is that you have to deploy your people in the
agriculture and in manufacturing, because it has the most use of limited
productive skills. It is also called the volume deployment of workforce.
We know that we have not been able to actually kickstart the
manufacturing in a greater manner. What we do is after the second stage,
which is the value creation stage. You keep the money targeted for
fastest technological learning, which means what you need to do is to
radically restructure the agriculture. You can also acquire higher level
of skills in technology in the manufacturing domain.

To give you a context, India has 1.6 times has land, and then there is
China. Yet, our , China's production is double that of India. We have
160 million hectares, and China has about 104 million hectares, which
means that 1.6 times land, but the China production is double. The
opportunity for us is to produce more. But, why don't we produce more?

If we produce more, what will happen? We have to understand that the
opportunity of country and why we were 25%, because God has given us
everything, Let's understand the post-nuclearization era. Before the
world became nuclear, countries used to make colonies. After
nuclearization, there is a new world order. How to make colonies and how
to how to ensure that the richer countries are getting richer.

Economy at heart of agenda

The fundamental is the economy. The economy is at the heart of the
government agenda. Whatever the government requires to do, whether it is
to build the social and physical infrastructure, or you have to build
your defense and security. Or, you have to redistribute the money from
the rich to the poor. For all, you require money. For that, the economy
is at the heart.

You build businesses to take share from the global pie. That's what the
world has done. What is the process? We have to understand that nations
are rich only if their companies are rich. That's the only process of
growth about how to build companies. Only the large companies can
compete on the global scale. The winner takes all is the principle.

How do we build those companies? First is the nurturing, where you
protect and support the infant industries. Then, you enable them to
attain scale to compete globally. This has become the new military
system of the developed world for making colonies. The only process of
building a robust economy is champion companies.

Building champions

Let's understand how the champion companies work. It's a top down
champion companies which means very large companies. Once you have
developed a company, in China, I've seen factories employing 1 million
people, people in just one factory. If you have 1 million people in this
factory, you have giant companies supporting you. Maybe, companies
employing five hundred thousand people. Then, to support the giant
companies, you have large companies company deploying 100,000 people, to
support these large companies. You have MSME companies, and to support
these MSME companies, there are very small companies to support that.
That's how you create the ecosystem.

You need to have such a large ecosystem. When I go to China, I see
hundreds of restaurants in a row, and each restaurant is really running
well. There's so much of the ecosystem, and there are so many people
earning a lot of money. They are going to all the restaurants.
Consumption is at a very high level.

In India, I see at certain places, there are 5, 10, and even 20,
restaurants, and suddenly, you will see restaurants going down. That is
because of the fundamentals. We don't have very large economy built on
the basis of manufacturing. So, what does this ecosystem does? It
becomes globally competitive manufacturing and service ecosystem
employing millions of people. It starts doing exports. The whole focus
is how can you take share from the global GDP.

To take share from the global GDP, you focus on exports. Whether it's
goods or services, you have export and get the export surplus. That
export surplus multiplies in the economy as an economic multiplier. When
you have a very large ecosystem, then the kind of farm production, you
consume, whatever the farmers produce. The farmers also become very
wealthy.

Sometimes we see farmer produces, but they have to leave their farm
production and the farms itself, because there is no taker. That's
because we don't have a large economy. When that happens, and the farmer
become very wealthy, they start creating demand for manufacturing goods
and services. That's how you create a virtuous cycle in the economy.

For that, what is the impact of domestic champions economy? Let me just
take you through the numbers of Fortune 500 companies. What is the
revenue of the Fortune 500 companies for the global GDP? We find that
companies produce 40% of the revenue in the global GDP. In Taiwan, eight
companies produce 73% of Taiwanese GDP. In France, 26 companies produce
69% of French GDP. In China, 135 companies are producing 56.6% of
Chinese GDP. In Korea, 15 companies produce 51% of the foreign GDP. In
Germany, 27 companies produce 51% of the German GDP. In USA, 122
companies produce 47% of a giant US GDP of more than $20 trillion.

In India, about seven companies are creating nearly 13% of the Indian
GDP. Four are government or the public sector firms. We have a very
small economy. Only 7% is contributed by seven companies. So, this is
the US vs. China in 1996. China had only one company in the Fortune 500
list. Today, China has 135 companies, it has surpassed USA. The USA has
only 121 companies. This is how China has grown by making Fortune 500
companies as champion companies. This is a percentage share. China share
is about 56% of their GDP of these top 135 companies. The USA has 44% of
these 121 companies.

We have to understand why and how does that happen! The developed world
deploys only three inputs of building champions. Number one, utilizing
the domestic market to build champions. Number two, banks followed
completely development agenda through the monetary policies. Number
three were the fiscal inputs through budgetary mechanisms, that the
other three mechanism the world has followed.

Every country is today advocating the free market, follow protectionism
and champion policies to create world-leading firms. In 16th century,
Britain did the same tax export of raw wool and import of clothing to
nurture export-oriented wool and textile industry. In the 17th century,
France followed similar policies as Britain. In the 18th century,
pressure from Frederick the Great in all interventionist policies were
followed. In the 19th century, the first Treasury Secretary, Alexander
Hamilton, of USA, was dubbed as in the USA mother of all protectionism.
Then, in 19th century, unified Germany refined and expanded the policies
of Europe. Then, in 20th century, Japan learned from German
protectionism, followed by Korea, Taiwan and China. This is how the
world has moved forward.

On the protectionism side, on the monetary policy side, what are the
modern monetary policies during development? Banks follow the
development agenda. There is low return for citizens when the
development agenda has been followed in the bank when they keep money,
maybe 1-2%. Less return is there. But, the entire money's focused
towards the development agenda and regarding discounting of loans
falling in the development agenda.

Focus on exports

Export is the key criteria. What are the fiscal policies during
enrollment? The government builds the necessary infrastructure to create
global scale. They incentivize domestic companies to create R&D supply
chain and manufacturing skills, and subsidize and incentivize to create
global competitiveness. These are three important elements on the fiscal
policy.

What are the outcome of the policies? High employment rate, acquisition
of technology and skills, creation of world-leading firms, multi-fold
rising exports, long-term financial and technological independence,
virtuous cycle of demand, and finally, migration from poverty to wealth.

We need to acknowledge failure first, and then start. We opened up our
economy prematurely. In 1991, we have done a great job. Money came into
the country, but it never made the country productive. It went into the
consumer lending, speculation of secondary market or speculation of
land, but never made the country productive. Economists studied the
policy, which were being followed in the developed world. They forgot to
see what the development world did when they were in the developing
stage. They completely forgot! And, that's is the big problem of the
country. Having said that, this is the best time to take a leap. This is
the big picture! Let's understand all that for electronics and IT.

Electronics and technology create the most value in the global market.
Total valuation of $15.5 trillion is created by the market cap of the
technology industry, which is about 17-18% of the total market cap
global market cap of about $85 trillion. If you see from the GDP
perspective, and similar contributions with the economic multiplier, we
have from the electronics and tech industries, because the revenue is $4
trillion, which multiplies at least about four times to add value to the
remaining GDP.

Roughly, $16 trillion is the value addition of electronics and IT in
GDP. The electronics industry revenue is about $3 trillion. Therefore,
electronics and technology are the most valuable sectors in the world.
The contribution of this sector is also growing in the rest of the
businesses. Electronics and technology are now being used everywhere.
Today, we are very clear that the world is looking at the alternatives
for manufacturing as the alternative to China. In China, the population
is now aging now, but the per capita income is rising.

Job opportunities are there for people beyond manufacturing. They don't
want to work for manufacturing. Wages have risen by triple in the last
10 years. The world is thinking that you are overdue depending on what
country you have to go in and do a different supply chain. Geopolitical
compulsions are there. Hence, the entire world is looking at China plus
one. India, is the best answer because of young, unemployed live
population and second-largest English speaking people in the world.

This country is the technology center for most companies. Software is
the key, and we are doing software for such a long time. We have
low-cost IT services. Software is key for electronics. Low wages are
there in the country because of low per capita income. This large
population is going to become a very large market with GDP growth.
Therefore, it is the best time for any company of the world to
manufacture in India in the same manner, as to how they have gone in
manufacturing in China for 30-35 years.

Because of the market access, you get local manufacturing. In Vietnam,
it's up to 8-9% of the Indian market, if you manufacture. Once you
manufacture in India, you get a very large market, eventually to
manufacture and supply to the same market.

Vision strategy

What is our vision strategy? Let's see this from the this perspective
that India population is about we are 18% of the global population yet
surviving on a mere 3.1% of the global GDP, which means that we have to
take our fair share from the global GDP. To do that, we have to export
goods and services.

We want to take electronics from $70 billion, which we manufacture in
2020, to $300 billion by 2026. We want to now go from 2020 to 2026 with
$300 billion of total production, out of which $180 billion is for local
consumption and $120 billion for exports.

Business eventually consolidates in the hands of very few players due to
the economies of scale. The same principle is equally valid for
countries as well. Only handful of companies are going to supply to the
rest of the world. We have a goal that India must take 50% share of the
global consumption of electronics by 2032.

We will not be only limited to companies are going to supply to the rest
of the world. To build 50% globally competitive value chain India by
2032, at least in the next 10 years, this is more the target that we are
taking the industry and also working with the government, and ensure
that the remaining 50% manufacturing in the world cannot be competitive
without using India's competitive value chain. That's the goal which we
are taking.

What are the strategic imperatives for that? The entire strategy is
export-oriented. In the bargain, we will also supply to the domestic
economy. We need to build a globally competitive supply chain and design
ecosystem in India.

How can it be built? By creating economies of scale! How can economies
of scale be created? By attracting global value chains to create and to
manufacture at scale. We need to mitigate disabilities. The PLI scheme
has been created to build Indian champions for long-term technological
and financial independence of the country.

Strategically deploying the electronic sector, and mobile phone is at
the core of electronics. Once you build mobile phones, you can build
anything. Every single product of hardware used anywhere else, is used
in the mobile phones. similarly, whether it is in the software, is
equally the same. It connects with the rest of the electronics. Once, we
are able to build an infrastructure of mobile phones, anything can be
built in India. This is the process of growth and dominance. Once we
understand how the mobile phone business happens, you acquire skills and
technology. Once you acquire the skills and technology, and if you have
the economies of scale at lower per capita, your output becomes very
competitive.

That's how the entire world has progressed. At 17% of Chinese per
capita, India's output would be most competitive globally, once we are
able to create economies of scale. It is the visionary PLI scheme to
create economies of scale for global champions and their value chains to
start the ecosystem. The Indian champions have a separate scheme, so
that we are able to deepen the skills in the value chain inside India,
for long-term technological financial independence.

China holds the largest share of the mobile phone value chain. The
mobile phone value chain of 3.5% is in Europe, 10-15% in the USA,
depending on segment. Japan, Korea and Taiwan have about 35-45%, and
40-50% value chain in China. That's the scenario today.

Foreign companies today occupy 90.8% share of the mobile phone market in
India, and our Indian companies have 9.2% Volume market share vs. value
market share should be less than 2%. Here, the Indian Indian companies
were 44% of the market in 2015. They have come down to about 9.2% market
today. Chinese companies have grown to become 63% of the volume market
of Indian companies.

This is a situation facing the top segment of India. Apple is also
coming and going to manufacture in very large scale. The segment is
covered through Apple, but they have a very large Chinese supply chain
as well. Apple may bring their Chinese supply chain and manufacturing to
India because of some geopolitical issues. This is the challenge that we
have.

Samsung has also started exporting, but it's on a losing spree. Chinese
companies today command the largest market share in the value chain in
the whole world. They are, sort of, not bringing their value chains in
India. That's the issue we have. Indian companies are being throttled to
capital burn and supply chain cartel of the Chinese companies. That has
happened in the past.

What is the way forward? It is very clear for us that India needs to
change the mindset first. The biggest business of the country is the
government. Government has to think that they are fully responsible for
building the globally competent ecosystems and the firms belong to the
government.

You have to change the measurement system to change the behavior, and
change the mindset of people working the government so that they believe
that their companies are theirs. They have to build companies to create
finally, and to change the country from to migrate from the country and
from poverty to wealth.

Secondly, Chinese companies and their supply chains, when they are
coming, must follow the development agenda. Once they are following the
development agenda, they must be given green carpet for companies
bringing skills and fully aligned to follow the development agenda. To
export from here, because the Taiwanese companies and Japanese companies
went to China because they utilize the global capital of China and their
human resources. They exported from China to the world.

We must also follow that, because our per capita is low. Once we are
able to create skills, we will be the most competitive. Any company
who's utilizing the India's labor and exporting out of India must be
supported. Last the fiscal policies. We have to create the economies of
scale through incentives and subsidies. We have to create the roadmap
for globally competitive supply chain and for globally competent supply
chain from India.

We have to utilize the domestic market. That's what the world has done.
For Indian companies to build scale, we have to give them exclusive
market access of roughly 20%. The market can enable scale for creating
Indian champions or global Indian champions.

With this action, we will build the globally competitive supply chain in
India in a very big way. Banking must follow the development into banks
to have targets to build Indian champions. They have to follow the
development agenda, and set targets to build globally comprehensive
financial cost by subsidizing the cost of companies following the
development agenda.

Science, management, startups - Bangalore Business LitFest provides a
treat of books and authors

From politics to publishing, speakers at the Bangalore Business
Literature Festival share a wide range of insights for entrepreneurs and
leaders.

The seventh annual Bangalore Business Literature Festival (BBLF) will be
held online on September 21-23 this week. YourStory is the media partner
for BBLF; see our coverage of earlier editions in 2020, 2019, 2018,
2017, 2016, and 2015.

See also YourStory's Book Review section with reviews of over 320
titles, and our compilation of 85 Quotes on World Book Day.

Our earlier five preview articles addressed startup advice, failure
recovery, business resilience, reader patterns, and creativity tips. In
this article, the authors discuss trends in Indian science, business
writing, opportunities for entrepreneurs, and better management
practices.

Indian science

"It has become hard for the public to appreciate the value of science in
a national context. Science is so advanced these days that the public
hardly gets to know what happens in the country's labs," observes Hari
Pulakkat, author of Space. Life. Matter: The Coming of Age of Indian
Science, and editor of science and technology magazine IITM Shaastra.

This lack of knowledge has implications for the country as public
understanding influences policy in the long run. "So, the central
challenge of Indian science, as in any country, is to get the public and
its leaders to appreciate the value of science," he adds.

The second challenge is money. "India is a resource-constrained country
and so needs to spend money wisely. The first challenge - distance from
the public - is therefore tied to the second, because a careful
understanding of science is necessary to make decisions on what to
fund," Hari explains.

These two aspects have affected the progress of Indian science. "Yet,
considering the money spent on education and research, India has done
very well," he says.

"India is among the top five nations in terms of research output, and it
excels in some select areas. However, the overall quality of research
(if you remove a few top institutions) is still quite low," Hari
laments.

Pandemic impacts

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on the
health and economies of nations around the world.

"We learned a lot about ourselves and alternate ways of living and
working during the pandemic," observes Keel Hunt, author of The Family
Business: How Ingram Transformed the World of Books. The lockdowns led
to many routines of life becoming more personal.

"Choices were more limited, and we all became more interested or even
dependent on how publishers, booksellers and authors did their work in
service to society. Many players in the book trade responded well to
these challenges," Keel adds.

"I believe we found that humans are much more resilient than anyone
believed possible," he says.

"The pandemic has taken a lot of money out of the system and so there
will be pressure on the government to cut funding in science. But, on
the other hand, the pandemic has led to a realisation that science is
important to our future," Hari Pulakkat adds.

"We will have to and see whether this realisation will lead to increase
in funding overall or only in some areas like healthcare," he observes.

The pandemic has also led to two other contradictory trends. "The first
is the feeling that India needs to stand on its feet in science and
technology. The second is the need to cooperate with other countries in
science to solve big problems. We have to again wait and see how these
two tendencies will influence each other," Hari explains.

Management and leadership

Four authors address the changing face of leadership, demographics, and
technology impacts.

"The leaders of successful companies, of any size really, must be
thoughtful leaders of people, as well as innovators of products and
services. This fact is real at any stage of development," observes Keel
Hunt.

"As we learn from the Ingram story, the "intrapreneur" especially must
be both a risk-taker and a person capable of keeping the dream alive.
Ingram's Lightning Source, the print on demand innovator, is an
especially good example," he adds.

"The most common misconception about organisational politics is adopting
a victim mindset - They did this to me," explains Bhavna Dalal, Founder
and CEO of Talent Power Partners, and author of Checkmate Office
Politics.

"My attempt has been to get people to see what is it about you that
allowed others to do it to you, and transform or remould that such that
you don't allow that pattern to be repeated," she adds.

"Another misconception is that I am virtuous because I stay away from
politics. However, to tackle something you need to know it and
understand it. If you label "politics' as bad, you will never get close
to handling it," Bhavna says.

The growing base and power of millennials is a key trend in business,
society and politics. "Leaders should really focus on talking and
listening to millennial employees. Millennials, mostly, do not feel
heard right now," observes Vivan Marwaha, user researcher and author of
What Millennials Want: Decoding the Largest Generation in the World.

"The policies they need are not different from what other generations
would have liked, but it is really important to actually engage in a
meaningful dialogue with millennial employees instead of imposing
top-down policies," he advises.

"Everyone struggles to manage between life and technology. This is a
continuous journey and is actually harder for millennials since they are
far more networked and therefore constantly interrupted or impacted by
others," observes Rishad Tobaccowala, author of Restoring the Soul of
Business: Staying Human in the Age of Data.

Customers and fans

In addition to internal changes, external shifts have led companies to
reinvent the way they engage with customers.

"Fandom is the avenue that companies can use to reach their customers in
that genuine human way," explains David Meerman Scott, author of The New
Rules of Marketing and PR and Fanocracy: Turning Fans Into Customers and
Customers Into Fans.

"Instead of shouting the loudest with ads that most people will ignore,
fandom allows companies to reach people's hearts-through what they love
or care about. That connection will last longer than any traditional
online marketing campaign," he adds.

This is now more important than ever because everyone is feeling the
chaos of digital communication. "The social media boom has happened, and
we have gotten so used to ignoring the ads on Facebook or Instagram," he
observes.

"We have grown tired of influencers who seem fake, and all we want is to
connect with friends and family. What we want more than ever is genuine
human connection," David says.

Entrepreneurship frontiers

The 'triple helix' of partnerships between academia, industry, and
government is regarded as key to boost India's entrepreneurship
ecosystem.

"There are no clear rules or procedures here. Partnerships between the
three have to evolve naturally, as more scientists feel the need to
spin-off companies based on their work. As their number increases,
startups are likely to be the bridge between academia and industry,"
Hari observes.

In addition to the tech side, there is also a boom in cultural
entrepreneurship. Kaninika Mishra, author of The Indic Quotient:
Reclaiming Heritage Through Cultural Enterprise, points out that the
ventures and initiatives in her book are not just businesses.

"They are preserving and promoting indigenous ideas from our unique and
timeless heritage and thus contributing to India's soft power. It is
often assumed that soft power diplomacy is a national level endeavour,
but in their own way, these entrepreneurs and activists have helped
positively influence and shape the perception about India," she
emphasises.

Keel Hunt also offers tips for aspiring entrepreneurs. "Understand that
your dreams are important - in fact, they are vital not only to your
personal financial success but also, in some cases, to your national
culture. This is especially true for people engaged in the world of
books," he advises.

Business writing

"Business books account for a big chunk of the non-fiction category,"
observes Tony V Francis, author of the novel The Autograph Seeker, and
Chief Revenue Officer, Matrix Publicities(WPP).

As categories in this space, he points to biography, history, marketing,
sales, business culture, human resources, small business,
entrepreneurship, job hunting, careers, management, leadership, and
skills.

"There is also the trending and important Women and Business category,
and Inclusiveness in the Workplace. Business professionals are writing
like never before and it is not only to capture experience and
expertise," Tony adds.

This business writing is taking place because of the opportunities it
opens up. "It helps in gaining thought leadership in the industry, helps
one's business, gets media attention, and engagements for keynotes and
paid speaking," Tony explains.

"A published business book that has something compelling to say can also
become a powerful business and brand-building tool. Professionals have
realised it," he says.

"Desired distribution may be a challenge for first-time authors, but
publishing is not. For established writers, as long as people want to
gain a fair amount of knowledge and be inspired, their audiences will
only grow," Tony affirms.

He also describes three key elements of a good business book - people,
problems, and potential solutions. "Writers should be clear who they are
after. They should clearly state the challenge the reader has and the
downside it creates for the reader," he describes.

The author should indicate that there is a possible solution to that
problem. "Can the book give resolution to that specific problem? You may
not want it to be on an expansive subject like leadership in the
workplace. Ideally, it should be more specific, such as a book that
helps frontline trainees become leaders," Tony advises.

Festival highlights

With 34 speakers featured in 13 sessions spread across three evenings,
BBLF offers a wealth of insights by authors in a diverse range of
fields.

"The Bangalore Business Literature Festival and The Bangalore Literature
Festival are very close to my heart. I became a part of the lit
ecosystem because of these two culturally relevant festivals that have
been drawing the best minds from around the world," Tony V Francis
explains.

He volunteered for an earlier edition of BBLF and attended a workshop on
screenplay writing by Anjum Rajabali. "I was then on my maiden novel,
The Autograph Seeker. Rajabali is one of the best screenwriters in the
country and he drove home the concept of serving one's apprenticeship as
a writer," Tony recalls.

BBLF has a range of unique sessions this year. "Indian business writing
is dominated by a few authors, and R Gopalakrishnan is right on top,"
observes Benedict Paramanand, Co-founder of BBLF and author of CK
Prahalad - The Mind of the Futurist.

In his career spanning nearly half a century, holding senior leadership
in HUL and the Tatas, Gopal has published 16 books. "Conversation with
him at BBLF will be to learn how to be a prolific writer even while
holding a top job, and why he picked the range of topics he did,"
Benedict describes.

Very few people know how a "deep state" works. "Businesses are
intrinsically part of it. Investigative journalist Josy Joseph will
discuss his new book The Silent Coup with author Mihir Sharma," Benedict
adds.

Rama Bijapurkar, thought leader and expert on marketing and branding in
India, will end the festival by reflecting on the evolution of Indian
business writing and the new challenges it faces.

After more than 30 years, the Wuhan development zone has turned itself
into a mecca for innovative companies

Editor's Note: As the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate
its 70th anniversary on Oct 1, China Daily is featuring a series of
stories on the role regions have played in the country's development and
where they are today.

Optics Valley in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, has long been
hailed as the country's version of Silicon Valley, due to the booming
number of successful startup businesses it has attracted.

Established in 1988, the 518-square-kilometer development zone is home
to 42 universities, 56 national and provincial research institutions, 65
academicians and more than 300,000 professionals.

Optics Valley is like the home where we started our dream. The
authorities are doing their utmost to support us with their policies and
help us have more media exposure

Wu Bing, co-founder of Shimo Docs, cloud-based collaborative office
software

Its major industries include optoelectronics, biomedicine, energy saving
and environmental protection, high-end equipment manufacturing and
modern service industries.

Among five unicorn enterprises - startup companies valued at over US$1
billion - is video game livestreaming platform Douyu, which recently
made its trading debut on the US Nasdaq Stock Market.

A number of startup companies in Optics Valley have hit the headlines in
recent years due to their innovations and cutting-edge technologies. The
startups are also attracting talented people from Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou, and even overseas, because of the dynamic atmosphere and
preferential policies in Optics Valley.

"While the cost of living is rising in big cities, second-tier cities
are developing fast and their life and work environments appeal to young
people," said Zeng Yumei, director of talent and entrepreneurship office
of the administrative committee of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development
Zone, another name for Optics Valley.

Attracting talent

In 2009, they launched the 3551 Optics Valley Talent Scheme to offer
funding for potential startups, with 1,699 individuals benefiting so
far.

Wuhan, with a total of 83 universities, ranks second in the country
behind only Beijing when it comes to higher education institutions,
providing a large talent pool for corporations in Optics Valley. In
2017, the city government created special subsidies to encourage
university graduates to work in Wuhan.

Optics Valley now boasts a population of 1.79 million and 70 percent are
below the age of 35, making them the backbone of the workforce. Last
year, the percentage of those with an associate degree and above level
living in the valley was 81.6 percent, an increase of 26 percent
compared with 2008.

"Young people are the future of the city's development," Zeng said.

"A cluster of young talent will reshape the city's spirit, culture and
image, attracting more and more talent from other places. We're more
than happy to assist them in all aspects in their entrepreneurship."

She said pioneering companies in Optics Valley share several things in
common.

"These entrepreneurs are ambitious and have strong nerves to risk the
danger of possible failure in startups. Their corporations have core
competence that makes them stand out, with steady management and good
use of capital."

Eyes on the prize

Optics Valley has witnessed the development of advanced technologies in
different fields.

Wuhan Homsh Technology is a manufacturer of high-tech chips for iris
recognition equipment.

"Iris recognition is suitable for application in public security and
security checks at border areas, with advantages in efficiency and
accuracy when compared with other biometric data such as fingerprints,"
said Yi Kaijun, the founder of the company.

Iris recognition technology is utilized mainly in anti-terrorism and
identity collection overseas. India includes iris scans in its national
biometric identity system.

Yi said since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 in New York, iris scans
have been used widely at airports and border checkpoints in foreign
countries. The US and the Middle East have their own iris databases.

Yi said in China it is used for building security and also to identify
miners before they go underground. He's confident that Chinese airports
will adopt iris recognition in the future, as concerns about public
security increase.

"Our iris equipment is smaller in size, with lower energy consumption
and more advanced technology. We're telling government bodies across the
country we can build an iris recognition system for them," he said.

Their equipment is able to log into the iris database of police
authorities, as it's on the list of their qualified iris recognition
equipment suppliers.

The company is also developing a small device that can be connected to a
smartphone for police and the military that can scan a person's iris and
compare it with information in the database.

"China's iris recognition industry will occupy an important place in the
world - its large population means a large iris database," Yi said.

Robot capsule

Optics Valley is also the birthplace of NaviCam, the world's first
magnetically controlled robot capsule endoscope, which has the ability
to precisely capture images of a patient's upper gastrointestinal system
with a tiny camera.

The patient only needs to swallow the robot capsule and the entire
checking process takes about 15 minutes.

The capsule is produced by Ankon Technologies, a high-tech medical
device company in Optics Valley. Approved by the China Food and Drug
Administration in 2013, the robot capsule is widely used in more than
100 hospitals and medical centers across China.

"It's a breakthrough for China's endoscope technology; as a comfortable
and accurate method of gastric screening, it's able to diagnose cancer
in the early stages," said Xiao Guohua, who cofounded the company in
2009.

Xiao said they have published a number of medical papers about NaviCam
in international journals, and it has won praise from overseas experts
for both research methods and clinical application. The capsule has been
exported to countries including the United Kingdom and France and is
being evaluated for approval by the Food and Drug Administration in the
US.

Xiao attributed the company's success largely to the support of Optics
Valley. In 2008, he came back to China to pursue the project because of
the high labor cost in the US.

A year later, he was enlisted in the 3551 Optics Valley Talent Scheme
and was allocated startup funding of 5 million yuan (US$726,900).

"Industries like photoelectron, life sciences and healthcare are
developing fast in Optics Valley. Its preferential policies and friendly
environment are attracting various startups and talent from home and
abroad," he said.

"Optics Valley is open-minded about innovation. As long as you have good
ideas and products, you will realize your dream here."

Return of the natives

Ruan Rui, 37, founder of animation company Yhkt Entertainment, is a
Wuhan native who has taken advantage of what Optic Valley has to offer.

Last month, the company announced it had been authorized to produce a 3D
animation based on Chinese sci-fi writer Liu Cixin's Three Body trilogy.
It will premiere on Chinese video website Bilibili, a co-producer of the
animation.

Ruan graduated from Beijing's Communication University of China in 2005
and came back to found the company a decade later.

Just over one-quarter of the 140 staff members are from the province and
relocated to Wuhan for work. The majority of the employees were born
between 1990 and 1995.

"Young talent brings new ideas, which are important in the animation
industry," Ruan said.

"Wuhan is a vibrant city that has developed fast in its economy and
other aspects. You can maintain a good quality of life in Wuhan, where
the cost of living is a bit lower than Beijing and Shanghai."

Ruan extolled the preferential policies of Optics Valley saying his
company was awarded rent and talent subsidies.

"The quality of Chinese animation series has caught up with their
counterparts in Japan and South Korea in recent years. And the audience
in China for animation series is increasing greatly, making it a
potential market," he said.

Like him, 35-year-old twin brothers Wu Bing and Wu Jie, are natives of
Wuhan who chose Optics Valley due to its friendly environment for
startups.

Wu Bing worked on Wall Street and Wu Jie in Silicon Valley with both
returning to China in 2012 because of curiosity about the "great
changes" happening in their homeland. Two years later, they founded
Shimo Docs. Similar to Google Docs, it's a cloud-based collaborative
office software with Chinese aesthetic design. Many of its 20 million
individual users and 200,000 corporate users live in first-and
second-tier cities in China and are aged between 18 and 35.

"Optics Valley is like the home where we started our dream," Wu Bing
said. "The authorities are doing their utmost to support us with their
policies and help us have more media exposure."

Since 2016, their company has been selected to take part in an annual
project of Optics Valley that offers staff exchange programs, both
domestic and overseas, for entrepreneurs. Wu Jie said young talent is an
integral part of the company. The average age of their staff is 27.

"Our young staff members are self-motivated, with great professional
competence. They are of similar age and get along easily with each
other," he said.

"Our iris equipment is smaller in size, with lower energy consumption
and more advanced technology. We're telling government bodies across the
country we can build an iris recognition system for them," he said.

Their equipment is able to log into the iris database of police
authorities, as it's on the list of their qualified iris recognition
equipment suppliers.

The company is also developing a small device that can be connected to a
smartphone for police and the military that can scan a person's iris and
compare it with information in the database.

"China's iris recognition industry will occupy an important place in the
world - its large population means a large iris database," Yi said.

Robot capsule

Optics Valley is also the birthplace of NaviCam, the world's first
magnetically controlled robot capsule endoscope, which has the ability
to precisely capture images of a patient's upper gastrointestinal system
with a tiny camera.

The patient only needs to swallow the robot capsule and the entire
checking process takes about 15 minutes.

The capsule is produced by Ankon Technologies, a high-tech medical
device company in Optics Valley. Approved by the China Food and Drug
Administration in 2013, the robot capsule is widely used in more than
100 hospitals and medical centers across China.

"It's a breakthrough for China's endoscope technology; as a comfortable
and accurate method of gastric screening, it's able to diagnose cancer
in the early stages," said Xiao Guohua, who cofounded the company in
2009.

Xiao said they have published a number of medical papers about NaviCam
in international journals, and it has won praise from overseas experts
for both research methods and clinical application. The capsule has been
exported to countries including the United Kingdom and France and is
being evaluated for approval by the Food and Drug Administration in the
US.

Xiao attributed the company's success largely to the support of Optics
Valley. In 2008, he came back to China to pursue the project because of
the high labor cost in the US.

A year later, he was enlisted in the 3551 Optics Valley Talent Scheme
and was allocated startup funding of 5 million yuan ($726,900).

"Industries like photoelectron, life sciences and healthcare are
developing fast in Optics Valley. Its preferential policies and friendly
environment are attracting various startups and talent from home and
abroad," he said.

"Optics Valley is open-minded about innovation. As long as you have good
ideas and products, you will realize your dream here."

Return of the natives

Ruan Rui, 37, founder of animation company Yhkt Entertainment, is a
Wuhan native who has taken advantage of what Optic Valley has to offer.

Last month, the company announced it had been authorized to produce a 3D
animation based on Chinese sci-fi writer Liu Cixin's Three Body trilogy.
It will premiere on Chinese video website Bilibili, a co-producer of the
animation.

Ruan graduated from Beijing's Communication University of China in 2005
and came back to found the company a decade later.

Just over one-quarter of the 140 staff members are from the province and
relocated to Wuhan for work. The majority of the employees were born
between 1990 and 1995.

"Young talent brings new ideas, which are important in the animation
industry," Ruan said.

"Wuhan is a vibrant city that has developed fast in its economy and
other aspects. You can maintain a good quality of life in Wuhan, where
the cost of living is a bit lower than Beijing and Shanghai."

Ruan extolled the preferential policies of Optics Valley saying his
company was awarded rent and talent subsidies.

"The quality of Chinese animation series has caught up with their
counterparts in Japan and South Korea in recent years. And the audience
in China for animation series is increasing greatly, making it a
potential market," he said.

Like him, 35-year-old twin brothers Wu Bing and Wu Jie, are natives of
Wuhan who chose Optics Valley due to its friendly environment for
startups.

Wu Bing worked on Wall Street and Wu Jie in Silicon Valley with both
returning to China in 2012 because of curiosity about the "great
changes" happening in their homeland. Two years later, they founded
Shimo Docs. Similar to Google Docs, it's a cloud-based collaborative
office software with Chinese aesthetic design. Many of its 20 million
individual users and 200,000 corporate users live in first-and
second-tier cities in China and are aged between 18 and 35.

"Optics Valley is like the home where we started our dream," Wu Bing
said. "The authorities are doing their utmost to support us with their
policies and help us have more media exposure."

Since 2016, their company has been selected to take part in an annual
project of Optics Valley that offers staff exchange programs, both
domestic and overseas, for entrepreneurs. Wu Jie said young talent is an
integral part of the company. The average age of their staff is 27.

"Our young staff members are self-motivated, with great professional
competence. They are of similar age and get along easily with each
other," he said.

ABSTRACT

Purpose

The study aims to understand how big data analytics capabilities of tech
startups help them gain competitive advantage and improve their firm
performance. The study is performed for two countries: India and China.
A comparative analysis is also discussed in the study.

Design/methodology/approach

The study collected responses from tech startups from both India and
China. A total of 502 responses were collected with 269 from India and
233 from China. The results were analyzed using Warp PLS 6.0 after
testing for common method bias, endogeneity and reliability of data. The
study tested five primary hypotheses and also tested the effect of two
control variables: country of origin of startup and age of the startup.

Findings

We found that big data analytics capabilities have a positive and
significant impact on the firm performance and competitive advantage of
tech startups. While organizational culture proved to have a positive
impact as a moderator, innovation was found to have non-significant
effect. The results also found to have non-significant effect of age of
the firm while its country of origin does play an important role in
defining its success.

Originality/value

The study offer key insights for the tech startups operating in two
countries which are geographically neighbors but differ in the tech
expertise from each other. Moreover, the study offers key insights on
how does the origin of the country contributes significantly to
explaining the success and competitiveness of the firm.

1. Introduction

The performance of firms has always been of interest to management
scholars. The changing dynamics of business are mostly driven by
transformations in intellectual capital, modern and advanced
technological upgradations, roles and relevance of stakeholders, which
have led firms to being more competitive. Darwin's theory of “survival
of the fittest” is one of the apt theories in such a competitive
environment. A large part of competitiveness is driven by the kind of
resources which any firm possesses and more importantly how it builds
upon it and/or uses it for expanding its business (Anwar, 2018).
Management scholars have recently laid the importance of strategic
decisions for gaining a competitive edge over rivals, most of which are
driven by data (Raffoni et al., 2018; Raguseo and Vitari, 2018). A
recent report by Gartner confirms that established firms which have
larger market capitalization possess lesser risk and are often averse to
change as compared to firms with small market capitalization. The
dynamic nature of market and uncertain business dynamics makes it
difficult for young firms to take appropriate strategic decisions at
times, which leads to further dip in their existing market
capitalization and in extreme cases go out of business (Pusala et al.,
2016; Kubina et al., 2015). Firms that have survived in such a dynamic
and competitive environment are the ones that have used innovation as
their key to success (Jeble et al., 2018; Charles and Gherman, 2013).
The death of brands like Nokia and Kodak are examples where lack of
innovation and changing business practices with time led to their
complete failure.

Another critical success factor for success is the role of data which is
the new oil for most businesses (Beyer and Laney, 2012). Firms have
gained competitive advantage and have built strategic frameworks using
big data analytics (BDA), machine learning, artificial intelligence,
blockchain technologies, cloud computing, etc. (Akter and Wamba, 2016;
Behl et al., 2019). This has also led to firms practicing and living in
the world of industry 4.0 (Bag et al., 2020b). As all these factors help
in examining the success of firms, there exists a need to understand the
behavior of tech startups in an environment which is competitive, driven
by innovation and has a huge scope as far as the application of data
analytics is concerned.

Blank (2020) defines startup as “an organization formed to search for a
repeatable and scalable business model.” While the definition points to
concepts like repeatability and scalability as two primary attributes,
it is attributed to intellectual capital and competitiveness (Cavoukian
and Castro, 2014). Unlike established firms, where risk appetite is
higher, startups behave differently in understanding and reacting toward
competitiveness and score differently when it comes to practicing
innovation. A large part of their functioning can be explained by the
sector and immediate competitors they face and more importantly their
readiness to change and adapt to the growing needs of customers/clients.
Studies also claim that entrepreneurial strategy and intellectual
capital act as a foundation for startups as they significantly impact
competitiveness and sustainability in the business (Chen, 2019;
Davenport and Bean, 2018). When compared to external factors, internal
factors play a significant role in understanding performance-level
indicators of any startup (Furtardo et al., 2017). Knowledge management
also acts as a catalyst in fostering change in thoughts and actions for
startups as it infuses a sense of sustainability in the actions taken by
startups. With multiple theories and factors explaining the workings and
reactions by startups, it is worthwhile to explore this area for
geographies that have a high growth rate of tech startups in recent
years. India and China are two such nations where the rate of growth of
startups is more or less similar and more than that, they are believed
to behave similarly when exposed to competition (Behl et al., 2019).
Studies although have debated on why Indian markets are not ready to
compete with China; however, most of the debate is because of the
tech-investments made by these countries in setting up and growing the
e-commerce market.

There is no standard recipe for the success of any startup, but drawing
upon the lens of Whetten (1989); Sutton and Staw (1995); Wacker (1998);
it becomes important to ask three significant questions: what, why and
how in the context of startups. Earlier studies have attempted to answer
mostly one of the three questions using different methodologies across
different parts of the world (Gupta and George, 2016). A large part of
these studies is done in geographies that are technologically advanced,
rich in knowledge and offer intellectual capital by human capital
outsourcing. On the flip side, it is recorded that the rate of growth of
startups in these countries is relatively lower in comparison to nations
like India and China where growth and development parameters indicate
the scope of growth of new businesses.

The recent launch of “Startup India” in 2015 and the ongoing “Made in
China 2025” have helped the best brains and ideas to germinate and grow
in the same country. While both these countries are gearing up for a
startup marathon, there lies a structural difference in the sectors
which they have picked up. Indian startups largely rely on four pillars
of education, ride-hailing, e-commerce and online payments, whereas
China invests its ideas in developing artificial intelligence, robotics
and digital money like Bitcoins. While there are other sectors which
feature in the list, but their order of appearance is different for both
the countries. This calls for understanding the two economies which are
aiming toward the same goal of nurturing startups but are different on
paths and output which they want to achieve or output which would be
achieved. The study, therefore, aims to answer the following research
questions:RQ1. What role does data analytics capabilities of a firm play
in enhancing the firm performance (FP) in the context of Indian and
Chinese tech startups?RQ2. How does organizational culture and
innovation help moderate the relation between data analytics
capabilities and FP in Indian and Chinese startups?

To answer these questions, we investigate the antecedents to the success
of startups in India and China through the lens of dynamic capabilities
view (DCV) theory and examine the role of competitiveness and BDA in
explaining better FPs across the two countries. DCV is an extension of
the resource-based view (RBV) theory which proposes that firms' internal
capabilities contribute more significantly toward superior performance
as compared to external capabilities (Barney, 1991). Extending the
theoretical arguments of RBV into DCV, we propose to study the
relationship between big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) of startups
and competitive advantage which could then be used to explain FP. The
proposed relationship is moderated by organizational culture and
innovation, while the entire framework is controlled by control
variables like Age and Country of Origin.

The rest of the paper is discussed as follows. Section 2 discusses
theoretical underpinning, key review of the literature and
operationalizes the constructs along with their contextual references.
Section 3 details the discussion on all the hypotheses and proposes a
theoretical framework. Section 4 elaborates on research design and
nuances of data collection and preliminary results for data validation.
Section 5 presents the results of the study for both Indian and Chinese
startups. Section 6 presents a discussion of results for each country
and compares the same with each other along with proper justifications
and reasoning. Section 7 offers a critical debate on how does the study
contributes to theory and practice and discusses the shortcomings of the
study along with the future scope. Section 8 concludes the study.

2. Literature review

The journey of any entrepreneurial firm into the startup space is driven
by multiple factors, while their success is driven by factors like
vision, leadership, financial strength, technology support (Li et al.,
2019). There also exist factors which are not in control of the startup
firms like assessment and action on competition, degree of novelty of
the idea, rules and regulations laid down by the industry and government
of the geography of operation (Spender et al., 2017; Tellis et al.,
2009). One of such scientific measure is “Ease of doing business”
promoted by World Bank since 2003. Countries like New Zealand, Singapore
and Denmark feature in the top three countries consistently, while there
are countries that have significantly climbed up the rankings. India and
China are two such countries that moved up their ranks significantly.
India which stood at 142 rank in 2015 climbed up to 77th rank in 2019
and 63 in 2020, while China jumped from 90th rank to 46 in 2019 and 31
in 2020 in the same time frame.

The World Bank uses a five step process to measure “Ease of Doing
Business” which includes opening a business (starting a business,
employing workers); getting a location (dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property); accessing finance
(getting credit, protecting minority investors); dealing with day-to-day
operations (paying taxes, trading across borders) and operating in an
secure business environment (enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency)
(World Bank Report, 2020). Over the past five years, both the countries
have seen a significant surge in opening new businesses which has helped
their economy to grow significantly. Looking at the statistical data
from the World Bank report, it is found that the Indian startup market
has raised $50 billion across 3,700 + deals. The startup ecosystem has
already yielded more than 500 acquisitions and have created close to
7,50,000 jobs in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru and a lot of them have also
expanded operations in multiple countries. India stands at the third
highest start up economy after the USA and China. This also makes China
an interesting economy to study. With India and China featuring in top
three spots and significantly gaining ranks in “ease of doing” business,
it is worthwhile to understand two key aspects: competition within the
country and among the firms. India has created some great unicorns in
the recent past which includes Delhivery, BigBasket, Ola Electric, Dream
11, Rivigo to name a few. While, China and the USA dominate with over
80% of the world's known unicorns, despite representing only half of the
world's GDP and a quarter of the world's population. It is therefore
worthwhile to understand how both India and China's start up culture
through appropriate theoretical and practical lens.

Studies have explored the success and failure of startups from different
theoretical viewpoints like human capital theory, expectancy theory,
stakeholder theory, crowdfunding theory, prospect theory, etc. (Tsai et
al., 2015; Wamba et al., 2015). The literature on startups can also be
further classified based on technology and sector. It is important to,
therefore, study the success factors of startups through a systematic
review of the literature (Tranfield et al., 2003) and funnel them down
in the context of India and China. A next step would be to study them
using an appropriate theoretical lens and propose hypotheses. The
subsequent sections are written keeping this flow.

2.1 Underpinning theory

Dynamic capability view (DCV) theory has its roots grounded in RBV
theory and has its applications in the strategic management literature
(Vogel and Güttel, 2013; Makadok, 2001). The theory has been widely used
to understand the economic competitiveness of the firm through a
distinct and unique mechanism of capacity building which is considered
to be a resource (Lawson and Samson, 2001; Vogel, R. and Güttel, 2013).
Teece et al. (1997) proposed that for any firm to make a distinguishing
mark in the market by its available set of resources, RBV theory can
help in explaining the process. The concept was further extended and
supported by arguments of Wernerfelt (1984) who supplemented the thought
by addressing the importance of resources of any firm to gain
competitive advantage among its competitors. It is also documented that
RBV tends to support the argument of adding economic value to any firm
by strictly working on their internal resources, developing capabilities
for their external resources and deploying them strategically against
the competitors (Kim et al., 2015). The application of RBV was multiple
and studies confirm its application in developing countries and
developed countries, for firms across sectors and specializations, for
resources related to information and communication technology, BDA,
blockchain technology, etc. The theory was able to explain the
utilization and importance of resources for firms but lacked a better
understanding in a dynamic setting wherein there are multiple players
and each of them works with their own set of resources (Kraaijenbrink et
al., 2010). Wang et al. (2016) concluded that RBV can be further
extended using DCV which will help in explaining the competitive
advantage at the firm level and also instill innovation in firms.

The theory holds relevance for firms across sectors in an oligopolistic
market and moreover for firms that have entered the competition
recently. A digital startup faces similar issues as it needs to compete
with players of their maturity in terms of existence and moreover with
firms that have gained a higher degree of maturity and have a higher
degree of resources (Stubbs, 2014; Freeman and Engel, 2007). Therefore,
DCV holds a better theory to explain the digital startup market as the
players are more dynamic in nature compared to an offline startup for
which the competition is localized and often bound by geography. It is
also comprehended that the online startups have to constantly work on
improving the technical support in order to understand the omnipresent
customers and understand how their competitors are using technology
(Duan and Xiong, 2015; Carlson and Usher, 2016). Referring to the work
of Teece et al. (1997), dynamic capabilities encapsulate the firm's
capabilities to deploy, integrate and upgrade the competencies both at
the internal and the external level. Lawson and Samson (2001) further
added that dynamic capabilities support firms to substantially raise
their profits by keeping a check on the firm's capabilities in an
uncertain environment which holds true in today's scenario wherein
online startups are increasing at a rapid pace. Thus, DCV can offer
stronger theoretical support in explaining firms' ongoing investment
practices in resource building, their market analysis and their actions
to remain competitive without compromising on the FP.

The application is DCV suits best in the context of online startup firms
that face issues like risk and volatility, which have to focus on
tangible and intangible (Chen et al., 2012), internal and external
resources to remain competitive (Erevelles et al., 2016), or else they
will not survive in the business. The study, therefore, uses the
theoretical foundations of DCV to explain how BDAC helps the firms to
gain competitive advantage which then positively impacts a firm's
performance. We also control for innovation and organizational culture
as moderators which are key indicators in explaining the firm's
performance and startups to gain a competitive advantage in the online
competitive space. The next section discusses the scope and
operationalizes the constructs in the context of the present study and
details the importance of moderating variables in the proposed
hypothetical model.

2.2 Big data analytics Capability

BDA has been in the industry and in practice for a while now. It is seen
that the width and the depth of BDA have increased over time largely
because of the increase in the scale and magnitude of data and better
computing processors. Studies have predicted diversity and variety of
use of big data and predictive analytics (BDPA) for creating a niche in
the competitive space for every firm (Wamba et al., 2015; Akter et al.,
2016). BDPA also offers key insights to the business by offering strong
statistical support to interdisciplinary studies which can help
businesses grow (Dubey et al., 2018). The string of analytics coupled
with 5 V's of big data makes the process of analyzing raw data from the
viewpoint of the descriptive, inferential and prescriptive lens (Nguyen,
2018). Recent studies have also claimed that BDPA can offer insights to
any firm by churning complex and unstructured data into meaningful
insights (Shamim et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018). Studies also claim
BDAC is an organizational capability that firms use to gain a
competitive advantage in a dynamic environment (Wamba et al., 2017;
Gupta and George, 2016). Firms practice this by engaging big data
resources in the form of machines and specialists to churn data and
capture more customers and/or work toward retaining their customers to
gain market share and in turn improve their profitability. We can,
therefore, confirm that by extending the learnings of DCV theory, a
startup firm would also have to rely on two key factors: machine and
manpower to develop their BDAC (Winter, 2003; Schoenherr and
Speier-Pero, 2015). Thus, BDAC can be operationalized as the combination
of data and skillset (both technical and non-technical) for making
meaningful and timely predictions of the market which in turn will help
strategize them better against their competitors. A brief discussion on
the subparts of BDAC can be referred to as under:

2.2.1 Data and its importance

Data is the new oil that runs businesses and its abundance has been a
challenge rather than its scarcity. Firms leverage the benefits of it to
gain a competitive edge over their competitors. The concept of “big
data” has been in the industry for a very long time but its popularity
and operational definition have changed quite recently which makes it
attractive for every business to look at (Mishra et al., 2018a; Mikalef
et al., 2018). The transition from 3 V's (volume, variety and velocity)
to 5V's has added two key elements of “value” and “veracity.” The
magnitude and speed of data have also been aided with its value which
has helped gain an edge over others (Galina, 2013). One of the most
important results which firms look forward to is the capacity of data to
reveal trends, help predict the future and understand the dynamic nature
of businesses (Galina, 2013; Dubey et al., 2019a, 2019d). BDPA has also
helped firms especially startups to understand the hidden layers of
information and helped them place their product/service at par with the
existing competitors. Studies also reflect BDAC as a key resource for
strengthening their core operations and therefore strategize their next
steps (Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018; Liu, 2014). The popularity and need for
BDAC have helped firms to hire specialists in their firms. Reports have
also claimed that 85% of the tech startup firms stress on understanding
BDPA to gain market insights and use tools to extract information for
their business. With data, comes an urge to understand its nuances and
moreover hire resources to understand its language as well (McAfee et
al., 2012; Batistič and van der Laken, 2019). Thus, while data is
important, but it alone cannot solve issues in any company.

2.2.2 BDPA skillset and its importance

BDPA skills are hard to possess because appropriate resources are scant.
Studies have discussed that firms need both managerial and technical
skills to ensure BDPA tools are harnessed to the best of their capacity
(Gupta and George, 2016; Mikhalef et al., 2020). It is also reported
that in business expansion and moreover in new business setup, managers
and technical staff should understand data from its generation phase to
its analysis phase. Technical skills are something that every firm
thrives for and it becomes more difficult for a startup to possess a
team of highly trained technical staff because of their uncertain nature
of business growth (Nemati and Khajeheian, 2018). Startups face
challenges with respect to hiring, compensating and retaining a
technical resource as their business operations are governed by revenue
while at the same time, they have to be competitive in the market
(Prescot, 2014, 2016). The technical workforce available is equally
underprepared as most of them are academically strong but lack required
and relevant practical exposure which is also a matter of concern for
startups while hiring (Rai and Tang, 2010; Kabir and Carayannis, 2013).
The technical human resource is also difficult to retain because of
their higher demand which makes them vulnerable resources. Thus, the
success of any startup depends on their technical team which understands
data as well as understands business to present key insights for them to
be competitive. Firms also need to invest substantially to upgrade the
knowledge and skills of their technical workforce to be competitive
(Hansen and Wernerfelt, 1989; Abbasi et al., 2016; Akter et al., 2016;
Dubey et al., 2019b, 2019c).

While technical skills offer brains to business, managerial skills offer
smartness and personality to the business. Managerial skills are a
result of working experience with multiple clients and on multiple roles
for a considerable amount of time for different/similar firms (Abbasi et
al., 2016; Mikhalef et al., 2020). The success of any BDPA project
depends on the managerial skills of the team, a large part of it is
driven by how clearly, they understand the goals and how they strategize
to achieve that with given resources (Cavoukian and Castro, 2014).
Managerial skills are also a function of time and its reward which an
employee looks forward to. Thus, for any startup, getting these embedded
into their culture becomes relatively tough as they are low on time
spent in the competitive space (Ngai et al., 2017). It is also
postulated that startups face the risk of hiring resources which are
either promising on paper or are far away from understanding the
complications of BDPA and its importance in driving their business
(Chen, 2019; Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018). BDAC is largely dependent on how
well the managerial functions are handled by the team and how can they
translate their skills in achieving profits and treated as competitors
by others (Bag et al., 2020a). It can be thus summarized that apart from
data which is generated by machines, the data managers are the ones who
are actually responsible for supporting life to any business.

2.3 Firm performance

Any firm in their sector is usually judged by its performance and market
capitalization. Studies have documented that FP is a key indicator of
the growth as well as the financial and intellectual health of the
company (Gunasekaran et al., 2017; Hansen and Wernerfelt, 1989). It is
also noted that companies often invest in both tacit and explicit
knowledge to raise their intellectual capital and therefore their market
share (Mishra et al., 2018b). Therefore, both market share and financial
health form key indicators to assess the firm's performance. There are
various proxies used in academic literature for FP (Mithas et al.,
2011). Out of all different types, studies have stressed the importance
of operational performance and market performance to measure a firm's
performance (Gupta and George, 2016; Rai and Tang, 2010). Both the
parameters are also used in the context of startups as well as help in
measuring both financial and operational performance thereby helping
them to understand how are they standing within their peers. Market
performance for any online startup is crucial to understand their market
share of existing customers and potential customers as well. A firm
scoring high on market performance alongside a strong and significant
rise in operational performance minimizes the risk of losses and
shutdown (Ngai et al., 2017). Financial health which is often used as a
proxy to financial health helps in confirming that firms' startups have
started to gain attention and there is a constant flow of money. As
startup firms do not compete with only their digital twins in terms of
ideas but have their fathers and forefathers with a wider scale of
business, it becomes more important for these firms to grow their
performance score as much as they can (Bag, 2017).

2.4 Competitive Advantage (CA)

There is a steep rise in entrepreneurial activities and the expansion of
businesses. Firms especially when they enter the market with a new
business model aim to understand the market and in the long run wants to
capitalize the market (Prescott, 2014, 2016). Firms invest in both
tangible and intangible resources to stay competitive and moreover be
agile (Stubbs, 2014). Sustainable business operations help firms achieve
excellence while competition helps them constantly improve. Studies have
also stressed the importance of ongoing competition within and outside
the firm to ensure productivity and profits (Worster et al., 2014). It
is also postulated that firms with an innovative idea and with the
first-movers advantage tend to be more competitive than their followers.
Businesses operated on digital platforms face bigger issues when it
comes to customer retention (Bradlow et al., 2017) because of the
volatility of their needs and existing players with a larger and
effective workforce. Kabir and Carayannis (2013) have discussed the need
to measure and standardize metrics for measuring and operating with a
competitive advantage in order to create and maintain benchmarks with
other players. It is recently been discussed in e-commerce literature
that while innovation drives new businesses, the spirit of
competitiveness has helped them grow and foster (Palem, 2014). It is
therefore, worthwhile to explore how competitive advantage can help
digital startups create and sustain their niche amongst their peers.

2.5 Organizational Culture (OC)

Organizational culture is a key driver behind the success of any
organization. Studies have proved that organizational culture is the
outcome of employees and their relationship within themselves and with
customers/clients. It is also proven that a well-nurtured and cultured
organization has a better performance and contributes toward the
sustainability of the practice of excellence (Davenport and Bean, 2018;
Dubey et al., 2019a). Recent works have also explained the tangible and
intangible resources help build organizational culture as it inculcates
a habit of understanding recent practices which the industry is
performing/using in any firm (Dubey et al., 2019b; Frisk and Bannister,
2017). It is also seen that organization culture has been pivotal in
helping firms adopt, implement and adopt BDPA projects (Teece, 2015;
Jeble et al., 2018). Studies have also highlighted the importance of key
decision-makers and their motives as a prominent decision-maker for
shaping the culture of any organization (Frisk and Bannister, 2017).
Unlike firms that have matured over time and have stabilized with their
organizational culture, there lie startups that have relatively a
shorter life in the market and are in the phase of building
organizational culture. The team sizes are also smaller and the business
models of startup firms are different from that of giants. Therefore,
while adopting a big data and predictive analytics tools and using them,
the internal culture of employees and the owners play a significant role
(Simon, 2013; Trabucchi and Buganza, 2019). The key stakeholders in
startups also face the risk of investing in their existing resources in
order to upgrade them or buying new resources to replace the old ones.
It is also imperative that while they strive hard to build their culture
of work, they are also bound by a dynamic environment around them.
Studies were done for understanding the importance of inter- and
intrapersonal skills (Hofstede, 1998) and rational choices made by the
employees to evaluate the needs of any technology results in
understanding how organizational culture helps in promoting FP (Shamim
et al., 2019) and/or helps them survive in the competitive space. Of
many and varied classifications for studying organizational culture, we
have adopted and extended the work of Dubey et al. (2017) to understand
the transaction-based culture or relation-based culture in understanding
the adoption behavior of BDPA in startup firms. We have used the
cultural dimension as a moderating variable to understand the role of
BDAC in explaining FP and competitive advantage.

2.6 Innovation(IN)

Innovation in its contemporary form is defined as introduction of a new
product or qualitative change in the existing product, process
innovation new to the industry, opening of a new market, development of
new sources of supply of raw material or other inputs or changes in
industrial organizations (Rogers and Rogers, 1998). Firms have used
innovation as their primary tool for creating their market space and
have continuously worked toward improving on the realm of product or
service innovation. A lot of companies have also used knowledge as a key
resource which helps them to innovate while others have used technology
to distinguish them from masses. Innovation also involves the creation
of entirely new knowledge as well as diffusing existing knowledge
(Spender et al., 2017; Tellis et al., 2009). More recently, studies have
also discussed how innovation help firms gain better FP (Weiblen and
Chesbrough, 2015). Recent studies done for startups have proposed
innovation as a key indicator in understanding their success (Carlson
and Usher, 2016). Moreover, the rate and direction of innovation have
also been expressed as a catalyst in explaining their growth. Most of
the startup firms are started because of an idea that symbolizes
innovation and their success is a function of adding fuel to their
innovative idea through resources. It is also observed that tech
startups have innovation clubbed with new or improved technology to
address practical gaps (Chen, 2019; Oliva and Kotabe, 2019). Both
internal and external innovation helps the firms to survive and
capitalize on the market share and gain a competitive advantage. BDPA is
also seen as innovative practice for tech-based startup firms and its
applications range from fraud detection, customer engagement,
understanding behavioral intentions, analyzing social media patterns,
investment decisions, etc. (Kim et al., 2015). Sun et al. (2018) assert
that both product and service innovation would be essential for any
online startup to survive irrespective of their geography and magnitude
of customers. In light of the above facts, this study aims to understand
how innovation would help explain the competitive advantage and FP
better.

3. Theoretical framework and hypothesis development

The study applies the theoretical foundations of DCV and proposes to
understand how BDAC can impact competitiveness and FP for digital
startups. In order to discuss the arguments proposed in this study, we
referred to earlier studies that have used DCV theory to discuss similar
arguments in a firm's perspectives across various countries and across
different timelines. We performed a systematic review in exploring the
studies which have discussed one or multiple such hypotheses in
different technological interventions as well. We also know that
capabilities and resources are the key ingredients of DCV wherein
capabilities are required to improve the performance and productivity of
other resources while resources refer to knowledge, technology and human
resources in any firm. We also discuss how the application of DCV is
relevant and apt for understanding the nature of digital startups as
they have features resembling existing firms but face a different degree
of risks. It is also important to understand that investment for any
technology and moreover its intervention to understand its market share
is not a regular activity performed by startups. In light of the
existing argument, we have discussed each of the primary proposed
hypothesis along with the discussion for interacting and moderating
effect of “innovation” and “organizational culture” for digital startups
in different countries. Figure 1 presents the proposed hypothetical
framework for the study:

3.1 Positive relationship between BDAC and FP

Akter et al. (2016) in their seminal review article discuss the role of
BDPA in improving FP which was further tested by Wamba et al. (2017).
Referring to the literature of BDPA and FP, it is seen that new and
improved technology intervention has helped firms to perform better and
increase their efficiency. Gupta et al. (2018) also discussed how cloud
ERP and BDPA positively impacts FP. Literature also supports a positive
and significant impact of big data capabilities of firms on their
financial performance indicators like return on investment, return on
equity, sales revenue, market capitalization and has also helped
inefficient management of their customers/clients (Wamba et al., 2017;
Gupta and George, 2016). It is also witnessed that e-commerce startups
which are driven by technology are developing their big data capacity as
they have seen promising results from their established competitors in
their respective businesses. There seems to be less evidence available
exploring reasons why and under what conditions companies adopt and
implement BDPA in their operations (Wang et al., 2016), but it is well
established that there is a positive impact on their market and
operational performance post-adoption (Vitari and Raguseo, 2019).
Srinivasan and Arunasalam (2013) tested a similar argument for the
healthcare sector and found that BDPA has helped them reduce healthcare
waste and fraud. Dubey et al. (2017) also found positive and significant
results in a humanitarian context. As tech-based firms generate larger
and frequent data in their business operations and moreover, they are
more prone to the risks of performance, there is a need to explore the
relationship in their context. It is also important to assess the same
for different sectors as it would help in generalize DCV theoretical
implications for tech startups. We, therefore, hypothesize that:H1.
There is a positive significant impact of BDAC on the FP of tech
startups.

3.2 Positive relationship between BDAC and competitive advantage (CA)

Big data and its scope have changed ways and reason for firms that have
adopted them. Most of the firms began the process of adoption because of
expanding operations and studies claim that in larger corporations
treated it to be a luxury earlier. With the passage of time, studies
have presented the transition from a luxury for firms to the necessity
which has helped them gain CA (Kubina et al., 2015; Mikalef et al.,
2020). It is also shown that BDPA capabilities are outsourced as firms
face concerns regarding hiring and training resources for getting deeper
insights. It is also reported that firms have gradually drifted from
hiring third party resources to build technical expertise within the
firms to ensure customized and on-demand solutions (Nemati and
Khajeheian, 2018). The growth of the size and magnitude of data has also
forced firms to use BDAC to remain competitive. Drawing from DCV theory,
BDAC has proved to be a key resource for firms to expand the business
(Vogel and Güttel, 2013; Wamba et al., 2017). The positive effect of
using BDAC in gaining market share has been reported for firms in
countries like China, Australia and European companies. While most of
the earlier studies have looked at developing BDAC capacities internally
because of firms wanting to have more control, it becomes a necessity
for new ventures which lack capital and human resources (Gupta et al.,
2018; Winter, 2003). Tech-based startups often produce data as large as
their mature and old competitors but lack the depth and breadth of BDAC
resources. Davenport and Bean (2018) also reported that e-commerce firms
face risks of losing business if they underperform consistently which
forces them to be highly competitive. We propose to test the
relationship between BDAC and CA in such a context in order to
understand how are the results similar with respect to previous studies.
We therefore hypothesize:H2. There is a positive relationship between
BDAC and CA for tech startups.

3.3 Positive impact of CA on FP

Firms strive hard to gain a CA among their peers and competitors by
adopting appropriate strategic moves. Some of the early literature on
competitiveness proposes the importance of understanding the
consequences of competition in understanding the growth of the firm
(Teece, 2015; Wamba et al., 2017). Studies have reported that FP is
measured by the operational and market performance of the firm but is
not controlled by only the working of the firm alone (Wang et al.,
2012). As firms exist in an oligopolistic market, their performance is
also driven by how others are performing for similar or high proximity
businesses. Developing on the theoretical arguments of DCV theory, it
has been found that competitiveness drives FP in a positive manner
(Gupta et al., 2018; Dubey et al., 2019a). The market conditions are
often used as a driver for understanding competitiveness but as firms go
global, the expansion of market and businesses have also been difficult
to measure. Bradlow et al. (2017) performed a similar analysis in the
hotel industry and found a significant positive effect of CA on FP.
Drawing from the logic of DCV theory and earlier arguments, we aim to
test the same logic for tech startup firms. The theoretical argument is
worthwhile to explore as the online business market behaves differently
when it comes to understanding competitiveness. Shamim et al. (2019)
also discussed that as startups are new in existence in any sector, they
strive hard to achieve excellence and want to capture as much share as
possible. It is also recorded that startups usually have a novel idea or
technology which helps them gain market share and thus the scale of
competitiveness holds differently than for firms operating in offline
markets. It is, therefore, worthwhile to test the hypothesis:H3. There
is a positive impact of CA on FP of tech startups.

3.4 Moderating effect of organizational culture

Businesses have strived hard to develop their work culture which has
helped them improve their market share, gain operational excellence,
improved their customer retention and helped with gain consistent profit
with lower churn propensity. Management and psychology scholars have
worked on understanding the growth trajectory of firms which have
improved and improvised organizational culture (Frisk and Bannister,
2017). While the main driver of organizational culture is employees and
the leadership under whom they perform, it is recently been reported
that like an individual's cultural traits, organizations also possess
certain traits that help them set their goals and therefore achieve
them. As identified by many scholars (Dubey et al., 2017),
organizational culture classified by control orientation (rational hand
hierarchical culture) and flexible orientation (group and development
culture) play their roles on different effects on organizational
performance, respectively (Gupta et al., 2018). The operational
boundaries of firms have also been reported as a key indicator
controlling the performance and culture of work. Some key example
includes Toyota and Honda which differ from the place of origin and are
similar in their business but have different values and work cultures.
The growth of firms and their cross-functional roles in different
geographies have affected their working style and culture (Nguyen,
2018). However, this change has not affected the way firms leverage
their CA based on their working style. Some cases which have shown
interesting results are comparisons between brands like Apple and
Microsoft, Ford and Ferrari, Tata and Jaguar, etc. Studies have proved
that firms that promote flexible work culture has helped them gain a
larger and consistent market share and also helped with remain
competitive in the business when compared to firms that have a
controlled or closed working culture. Off late firms have also discussed
the factor of readiness to change and flexibility to adopt new knowledge
and technology as a part of organizational culture. The changing
competitive markets and growing customer base have also helped firms to
change their pattern of investments which are either done by choice or
by force so that they could book more profits by offering similar
products/services to the customers/clients (Seggie et al., 2017; Sun et
al., 2018). Dubey et al. (2017) have also postulated that there exists a
difference between control working culture and it should be mistaken
with an antonym to flexibility as control can help firms achieve their
defined goals in a stipulated time frame by investing on key resources.
Resources and its scope have also evolved with time for firms and
moreover for tech startups. Firms whose business model are reliant on
the Internet and they are not into a customer-facing setting, the
investment and use of digital tools like cloud computing, big data
resources, machine learning tools, which facilitate flexibility to
control their operations (Waller and Fawcett, 2013; Wang et al., 2012).
To achieve higher growth and financial health, tech startups are
required to have a suitable work culture and more important should be
open for innovations in their firm. Moreover, their work culture would
also help them hire and retain human resources and invest in demanding
technologies like “big data”, “artificial intelligence”, “blockchain,”
etc. which will in turn help them gain CA over their rivals. While
earlier studies have argued that organizational culture acts like a
catalyst for business, there is need to test to same in a tech-based
startup environment. We therefore propose:H4a. There is a positive
moderating effect of organizational culture on the relationship between
BDAC and FP.H4b. There is a positive moderating effect of organizational
culture on the relationship between BDAC and CA.

3.5 Moderating effect on innovation

Innovation is a key driver for the growth of any firm. Product and
service innovation have been considered as two integral resources that
every firm uses to gain profits and capture the market. With the advent
of the Internet, both products and services are monitored and controlled
by online activities of customers and firms spend a considerable amount
of money and time to understand the effect of any innovative practice on
their market capitalization and their financial and social performance
(Weiblen and Chesbrough, 2015). Innovation, since its inception has been
considered a source of constant motivation for firms to spend on
resources which would help them book more profits (Freeman and Engel,
2007). Research intensive firms have innovation as their highest capital
while firms belonging to the service sector follow them, while product
innovation has the least visible impact for firms. Studies also confirm
that innovation is mostly supported by the availability of resources
(Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018) which could be in the form of human resources
or technologies (Kim et al., 2015; Lawson and Samson, 2001). Recent
studies conducted in the sphere of tech companies in developed countries
like Japan, Australia and the USA confirm that innovation adds to the
intellectual capital of firms and helps them distinguish from their
competitors. It also helps companies attract more customers and makes
the process smoother by reducing the turnaround time. Tech startups also
leverage of the same principle wherein the firms offer either services
or products, a lot of them are short time and mostly for offering ease
in operations or ease of use of end-users (Prescott, 216). Extending the
logic of Innovation diffusion theory, the study aims to understand how
innovation impacts the competition and performance of firms in a
cross-cultural setting. We therefore hypothesize:H5a. There is a
positive moderating effect of innovation on the relationship between
BDAC and FP.H5b. There is a positive moderating effect of innovation on
the relationship between BDAC and CA.

4. Research design

We follow a systematic approach for collecting data and have consulted
experts at frequent intervals to avoid bias and minimize errors in
performing the required analysis. This section discusses steps used to
collect the required sample of data, sampling adequacy, discussion of
required tests to test the proposed hypothesis which will help in
reporting the required and relevant results.

4.1 Sample and data

We employed a survey-based approach for collecting data from startups
from India and China. The survey instrument was sent to key stakeholders
in the company, the details of which are discussed in the subsequent
sections. The questionnaire was sent to the founder members of the team
of startups in India and China. The study picked random samples from
databases like Angel.co which lists all the startups for all the
countries. We developed a database of startups that were registered as
companies between 2015 and 2017. This makes the companies with an
average life of 4 years suitable for any venture to establish. A sample
of 200 companies from each of the countries was selected and the
questionnaire was sent to their owner of key decision-makers with the
help of a market research agency.

4.2 Survey instrument

The theoretical framework used in this study is an outcome of a
systematic three-step process. The first step began with studying
existing scales (refer Table A7) and understanding their suitability and
applicability in the context of this study. The second step involved
extracting constructs and defining them operationally in the context of
the study. The selection of items and its finalization was done using an
iterative process by conducting pre-tests of the draft of the
questionnaire and getting its content-validation done by experts. The
details of the operational definition and the scales with which the
constructs and borrowed have been discussed in Appendix B. The response
was collected on a 5-point Likert scale which measured the degree of
comfort and acceptance on factors for enabling startups in India and
China. The instrument was then pre-tested with experts which were either
renowned academicians and have published papers in high impact journals
as well as practitioners who have contributed in the development of
startups. The instrument was revised based on the mutual discussion and
suggestions received by the panel of experts on the grounds of the
appropriateness of items and clarity on the operational definition of
constructs (DeVellis, 2016). The contextual clarity of the constructs
was also validated by experts using the guidelines laid down by Dillman
(2011) and appropriate changes were made which were then reconfirmed by
the same experts (Chen and Paulraj, 2004). The instrument was then
translated in Chinese by language-certified experts. The services of
language translators were also used to reconfirm if the translated
instrument had similar meaning and reference. The final instrument was
then used in a pilot study at two international conferences held in
India and China between January 2019 and March 2019. The questionnaire
was shared with the potential presenters in the international conference
to ensure that the final instrument is valid and reliable. We received a
total of 64 responses out of a total of 203 target respondents. The
results of the pilot survey were useful in finalizing the structure of
the instrument which was then used for the data collection process.

4.3 Data collection

The questionnaire was sent to the key stakeholders (founding members) of
the startup firms which are involved in taking strategic decisions and
were founding members of the organization through a market research
agency. A total of 1876 firms were contacted of which 912 were from
India and 964 were from China. The questionnaire was sent in multiple
waves by the market research agency to the required stakeholders to
collect data. We received a total of 514 responses from this exercise of
which 235 were from China and remaining were from India. We ensured that
we receive only one representation from a firm to maintain parsimony. In
the case of multiple responses received, the response recorded by a
higher designation employee was considered for analysis. In case of any
confusion, all the responses were dropped. Data cleaning eventually led
to a total drop of 12 responses thereby making 502 as an overall useable
sample size. Table 1 represents a bifurcation of samples based on the
Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). GICS is used as a basis
for Standard and Poor's and Morgan Capital Stanley International
financial market indexes in which each company is assigned to a
sub-industry, and to an industry, industry group and sector, by its
principal business activity. The study used two different samples, one
each from India and China for further analysis. The descriptive
distribution of the profile of respondents is mentioned in Table 2.

4.4 Non-response bias

The nature of data is empirical and was therefore checked with
non-response bias. Following the guidelines of Armstrong and Overton
(1977), we looked at the trends of responses from early and late
respondents. A sub-sample of 58 responses was randomly selected from
China and India to undertake this test and we found no significant
difference between early and late respondents. The results confirm that
there is no significant difference between the two waves for each of the
items tested for both India and China respectively (p > 0.05). We also
tested the financial performance of firms in both the waves by using
paired sample t-test and found that there is no significant difference
between the two for both the geographies: India and China (p > 0.05).
This confirms that the study is free from non-response bias.

5. Data analysis

The study used partial least square (PLS) structured equation modeling
(SEM) using WarpPLS 6.0 to test the theoretical model. WarpPLS is
proposed by Kock (2019) initially and its advancements are embedded in
the latest WarpPLS 6.0 which is extensively used by researchers on
multiple occasions to test hypothesis using empirical data (Dubey et
al., 2018a; Kumar and Purani, 2018; Kock, 2019; Ifinedo, 2016). PLS-SEM
and its advantages (Akter et al., 2016) have been discussed at length by
Peng and Lai (2012) especially in the context of predicting validity of
exogenous variables. Unlike traditional regression methods, SEM offers a
simulated environment for understanding the relationship and dependency
of multiple independent constructs with the dependent construct (Chin,
1998; Urbach and Ahlemann, 2010). Hair et al. (1998) have discussed the
advantages of SEM in distinguishing the properties of independent and
dependent variables and more especially exogenous and endogenous latent
variables. The debate of using covariance-based SEM and PLS-based SEM is
discussed by Preacher and Hayes (2008a) wherein they have proposed that
guidelines for using a particular type of SEM under given circumstances.
The present study satisfies most of the criteria laid down by Preacher
and Hayes (2008b) as this study stems from its exploratory nature and
the theoretical framework is not borrowed from the existing framework.

The theoretical framework offers first-order reflective measures most of
which are latent constructs. The items used to measure these constructs
are independent of each other and indicate that there is a possibility
of their existence irrespective of the construct name (Peng and Lai,
2012). Therefore, the items could be placed under any variable. This
also indicates a positive inter-correlation among the constructs in the
model (Diamantopoulos and Siguaw, 2006; Edwards and Bagozzi, 2000;
Jarvis et al., 2003). The use of PLS-SEM is also discussed for offering
simplicity in understanding results even with reduced sample size and
restricted residual distribution along with handling issues like factor
indeterminacy (Fornell and Bookstein, 1982). Therefore, following the
guidelines of Peng and Lai (2012), we examined the reliability and
validity of the measurement model to begin with followed by analyzing
the structural model.

5.1 Measurement model

We examined the measurement model before examining the output of
PLS-SEM. We first calculated variance inflation factor (VIF) which helps
in ruling out the chances of multicollinearity in data (Peng and Lai,
2012). The results of the study indicate its value to be 4.583 which is
below the threshold of 5. Any value greater than 5 corresponds to the
existence of risk of multicollinearity in the data. While studies claim
that average block VIF should be lesser than 3 in the most ideal
scenario, but our results indicate that it is still under the acceptable
limits. We also calculated the average path coefficient (APC) and
average R² both of whose values are recorded in the table. The results
are statistically significant thereby indicating that there are no
concerns related to model fitting the data. We therefore conclude model
fit for our data (Refer to Table A5).

We also calculated statistical suppression ratio (SSR), R² contribution
ratio and Simpson's paradox ratio (RSCR) and nonlinear bivariate
causality direction ratio (NLBCDR) test for checking the endogeneity in
the data following the guidelines of Kock (2019) and found their values
greater than the threshold value (>0.7) (Refer to Table A5).

We collected primary data for the study which may suffer from common
method bias (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). In the argument proposed by
Podsakoff et al. (2003), it is clear that data which is self-reported
may suffer from common method bias due to multiple reasons like social
desirability and consistency of responses. Of many methods proposed by
various studies, we employed the most robust method of designing the
instrument using multiple scales to minimize the effect across each of
the type of constructs (dependent, independent and moderating).

5.2 Common method bias test

As a second step for validation of CMB, we employed conservative version
of Harman's one-factor test (Podsakoff et al., 2003) which depicted that
one of the factors explained more than 43.45% of the variance. This
concludes that data is free from CMB. A third test following the
guidelines of Lindell and Whitney (2001) is performed on the data, often
discussed as correlational marker technique in literature. We chose a
six items scale for measuring “Innovation” which provided lowest
correlation between MV marker and other constructs (r = 0.07) to adjust
statistical significance and construct correlation (Lindell and Whitney,
2001). The three tests confirmed that there is a minimal scope for
common method bias in the data. This also confirms that while it is
impossible to completely remove CMB, it gives a significant test that it
has been controlled in design of the study.

Next, we tested for causality which is also a prerequisite condition
before hypothesis testing (Guide and Ketokivi, 2015). Referring to the
conceptual framework and discussed hypothesis, it is seen that the
arguments are presented unidirectional in nature. Thus, in order to test
for the causality for relationships with interchanging dependent and
independent constructs, we performed Durbin→Wu→Hausman test following
the guidelines of Davidson and MacKinnon (1993). The test results
confirmed that residual was insignificant thereby confirming that the
nature and characteristics of constructs remain as proposed in the
theoretical framework and there is no significant change in the proposed
relationships. The triple confirmatory tests (CMB-Causality-Endogeneity)
ensure data preparedness (Dubey et al., 2019a).

Summary statistics of each of the constructs are presented in Table A4.
We calculated scale composite reliability (SCR) of each construct and
found their value greater than 0.70, while their average variance
extracted (AVE) has values greater than 0.50 (refer to guidelines by
Hair et al., 2017). This indicates that there exists reliability for
every construct and the latent constructs in the framework account for a
minimum 50% of the variance in their corresponding and respective items.
It is also found that the loadings fall in an acceptable range and all
of them are significant at 0.01 level. Following the guidelines of
Fornell and Larcker (1982), it can be seen that the square root of AVE
is found to be significantly greater than the inter-construct
correlation. This is a strong indicator of discriminant validity. The
details of discriminant validity can also be referred to from Table A1.
We also calculated the value of Cronbach's alpha for each of the
constructs and compared them with the threshold value of 0.7 as
suggested by Hair et al. (2016). The results confirm that each of the
constructs individually is reliable (Tellis et al., 2009). We also
tested for checking the overall reliability which also exceeded the
threshold value. The results for the same are listed in the table.

5.3 Results of hypothesis testing and discussion

The results of the hypothesis testing using PLS-SEM can be referred to
in Figure 2. Results record a value of r = 31% for explaining CA and
overall value of r = 69% for explaining FP. Each of the corresponding
values of PLS path coefficients are their corresponding p-value (* for
<0.1; ** for <0.01 and *** for < 0.001) is recorded in Figure 2 as well
as in Table A2 and Table A3. The results of the hypothesis (H1 → H3) and
moderating effects of Innovation (H4a and H4b) and Organizational
Culture (H5a and H5b) have also been documented in Tables A2 and A3
respectively. Results reveal that there exists a positive linkage
between BDAC → CA (β = 0. 22); BDAC → FP (β = 0.42) and CA → FP (
β = 0.34). As all the β values are significant at 0.01 value of
significance, we can conclude that the results confirm that the H1→H3
hypothesis is supported. Results show that unlike the hypothesis for
moderating effect of organizational culture which positively affects the
relationship between BDAC and FP and BDAC and CA, hypothesis related to
the moderating effect of innovation is found to be non-significant.

6. Discussion

Results for moderating effect of IN and OC represent that while
hypothesis linked to IN and OC is supported. Thus, while innovation is
believed to moderating the relationship between BDAC and CA, results
assert this proposition which confirms that the dynamic capability view
theory could be used to test and validate relationship between BDAC and
CA which holds true in the context of tech startups as well. The study
also tested for effect of control variables → “Country of Origin” and
“Age of Startup”. It is found that “age of startup” does not have a
significant effect while “country of origin” has a significant positive
impact on both CA and FP. Required results and their corresponding
coefficients are mentioned in Table A4.

We then tested for exploratory power of our proposed theoretical
framework by calculating the value of R² for the endogenous construct.
We found that R² for CA is 39% which is considered to be moderately
strong while the value of R² for FP (74.3%) is strong as per the
guidelines of Chin (1998). We then calculated the value of f² for BDAC
using Cohen's formula. Both the values of f² related to CA and FP are
found to be more than the threshold value of 0.00 (Dubey et al., 2019a,
b, c, d). Lastly, following the guidelines of Peng and Lai (2012) we
checked for the value of Stone→Geiser's value of Q² thereby testing for
explanatory power of the endogenous constructs. It is found that the
values for CA (0.732) and FP (0.202) are greater than 0.00(threshold
value) thereby reflecting acceptable predictability of the model.

The results presented in the last section offer insightful discussion on
linkages between dependent and independent constructs especially the
effect of moderating variables on the hypothesized relationships. The
key indicators of hypothesis testing are presented in Tables A2 and A3
which offers significant insights on each of the proposed hypotheses.

While some hypotheses (H5a and H5b) are not supported by the data
although earlier literature has helped in proposing its relationship
(Carlson and Usher, 2016). This, in turn, offers new insights toward the
extension of existing theoretical relationships specifically in the
startup space. The results related to variables controlling the
exogenous variables also offer to an existing body of literature
especially when the study is related to multiple geographic boundaries
(Shamim et al., 2019). This section expands and elaborates the results
of each of the hypotheses in the context of the study and supports the
output with debates and discussion from similarly published works.

Our study is an early attempt to understand how BDAC helps tech startups
across different businesses gain a CA in their respective sector and in
turn help them achieve better FP using the lens of DCV theory. Our study
extends the earlier works done with different technologies in the
context of organizations, however this study is one of the unique kinds
which contributes to the literature of tech startups and offers
comparative results across two upcoming geographies (Gupta et al., 2018;
Kabir and Carayannis, 2013). We also explored how organizational culture
positively moderates the after-effects of the adoption of BDAC for
gaining CA for different tech startups. It, therefore, calls for
improving how these startups internally drive their success in a
competitive arena. Further, as our study is done on two economies which
are geographically closer to each other but are different from each
other in proposing business ideas and implementing them across different
sectors. Our study also counterintuitively discussed how and why
innovation might not be useful for explaining FP and competitiveness
(Kubina et al., 2015; Nemati and Khajeheian, 2018). One of the prime
reasons behind the same could be the use of diversification of
portfolios selected as a part of the sample in this study. Another
plausible reason could be that innovation is not an ongoing process
after the business is established, which once was important for all the
firms when they were about to enter the market.

In addition to this, we also found that while the country of origin does
matter in explaining how the startups would perform while the age of the
startup would not contribute significantly and does not offer
significant explanations. Thus, for both countries: India and China, it
becomes important to understand that similar ideas, when implemented in
a specific country, could help them earn higher profits. A common
example to support the argument is the rise of Alibaba and Alipay as two
of the most successful startups and Cure.fit and Razorpay is an example
that is successful only in the Indian market. On the flip side the age
and maturity of the organization do not matter as much in explaining its
performance and how well their standings are among its competitors
(Prescott, 2014, 2016). These results are opposite to what earlier
studies have discussed as far as understanding the development of BDAC
in firms to gain CA. Another justification for the same could be because
the age to mature any business idea depends on how well does the
customer/client respond to it, and therefore as the study is restricted
to only tech startups, the rate of acceptance of ideas could differ
depending on the need and outreach of startup (Shamim et al., 2019).
These results open doors for future scholars to discuss and comprehend
how innovation could be used as a predecessor to the adoption of
technology. It also calls for using Innovation Diffusion Theory with DCV
theory to explain the process of FP better. The study also proposes to
explore reasons and situations when age and the business which they do
play an important role in explaining their competitive spirit better and
help them gain better profits.

7. Implications of theory and practice

7.1 Theoretical implications

There are multiple theoretical debates in the past trying to understand
the role of competitiveness in the startup space, most of which are
either sector agnostics or geography bound. We aimed to extend these
studies by testing DCV for multiple sectors and comparing them across
two geographies. We offered a new dimension of extending the logic of
using BDAC as a critical resource which will drive the spirit of
competitiveness and hence the performance of firms. As the performance
of firms are critical, especial for startups as it proves to be one of
the most critical measurement of their success, it is important to
understand its function through the lens of BDAC as a resource. We also
see that literature has till now discussed how firms (mostly does not
discuss startups) have used BDAC as a strategic tool for gaining CA and
controlling and enhancing their operational performance. Our study
extends the works and offer new and significant results for the startup
firms. As the world is experiencing startup culture, testing a
theoretical paradigm for firms which are low on resources (at times
human resource, financial resource or strategic resource) and high on
risk of failing is more important. Thus, our study offers three unique
theoretical contributions:

Firstly, we discussed how BDAC can help in achieving CA to startup as
most of them have lesser market share and they need to be highly
competitive to survive when compared to the existing business giants. We
have grounded our assumptions from the lens of a dynamic capability view
of the startup organizations. As our study moderates the relationship
with “organizational culture,” we offer new insights that the culture
does play an important role in understanding how startups across
different sectors work to be competitive. Secondly, we projected that
while “innovation” is treated to be an important construct, it is
important that it's moderating effect does not hold significance when it
comes to understanding two key relationships BDAC → Competitiveness and
BDAC→ FP. Thus, it is interesting to understand that while diffusion
innovation theory focuses on firm's growth with innovation, use of BDAC
which is although considered to be resource does not stand out for
startup firms, rather it is the resourcefulness which matters to them.
Lastly, we extended the earlier debates of using DCV for a particular
geography and sector to a broader view which helps in generalizing facts
and offers strength to knowledge about how firms operate in a
competitive and resource driven space.

7.2 Managerial implications

Our study performed the analysis for tech startups for India and China
and the results will offer insights to firms which are currently
operating in Indian and Chinese context. As the study discusses the role
of BDAC on a firm's competitiveness and firm's performance by moderating
the effect of organizational culture and innovation, it would help
startups improve on their capabilities to adopt and adapt to BDAC going
further. We also confirmed that BDAC will help the firm gain a
competitive edge which could be useful for tech managers, training and
learning resource managers of startups to invest significantly in this
resource. Results can also guide the human resource managers to work
toward developing a culture in the organization which promotes a good
work culture. The results are helpful for budding entrepreneurs who want
to start their tech business as it gives insights on how selecting a
country is important for the success of the startup. It is also learning
that BDAC would continue to play a significant role in tech startups,
thus it would be recommended if the firms start investing in building
appropriate resources for the same.

The study offers key insights to Indian startup firms by making them
understand the importance of adopting business intelligence tools like
big data and artificial intelligence to drive their business. As
organizational culture plays a vital role, it is important for the
owners or top management of startup firms in India to maintain and
sustain organizational culture which is driven by learning and
improvement in terms of technology mostly. Also, in order to sustain in
the market competition, startup firms also need to understand that while
their business might not need BDAC directly, it is important to
understand how can BDAC help them catalyze their performance and gain
better results. As India lags far behind the race of developing
unicorns, the study would be more useful to understand market dynamics
and learn from China which has been producing consistently and abundant
number of unicorns.

Our study also offer key insights to Chinese startup firms by making
them aware that while innovation after a point will not be considered as
a unique selling point in their business. This is primarily because it
is easier to replicate business models over time. What matters to them
is how they start using big data and business intelligence to their
fullest capacity and expand their business so that they can translate
them into operational and financial performance.

7.3 Limitations of the study and future research directions

While our study discusses key insights for startups started in two
countries, the study needs to be further extended to compare startups
which have similar business ideas and are working in these two
countries. The selection of startup firms were the ones which were from
operational on the Internet, while the study excluded firms which have
their business operations in the offline space as well. The study lacks
presenting a growth trajectory of each of the firms or any specific
sector which could have been better to explore for anyone who wants to
start their own entrepreneurial activity. Our study does not factor in
country-specific and sector-specific constructs which could enable or
catalyze the process of adoption of BDAC in India and China. Our study
does not perform a longitudinal study with these companies to understand
how BDAC has helped companies gain and remain competitive over time.

The study could thus be extended by collecting more insights on the
customer database of the firm and test the presence of other competitors
and their impact on competitiveness and FP of each firm. We also propose
to perform a cross-sectional study across various tech sectors in both
countries to understand the growth and decline of every sector. We also
propose the extension of the study in the non-tech startup firms to
explore how technology acts as a catalyst in the process of adoption of
BDPA and developing its capabilities thereafter. To advance better
insights into BDPA capabilities, maybe the way of a mixed method
approach could do better, such as telephone interviews, semi-structured
interviews with respondents. By which, the relationships between these
constructs in our model could be further understood and lead to better
empirical investigation.

8. Conclusion

The study offers an insightful analysis in explaining the role of
developing insights from DCV theory to explain the phenomenon of
developing BDAC for tech startups in India and China. A comparative
study between two fastest growing nations in the sphere of startups
makes this an interesting and important study. We also offer novelty in
understanding multiple sectors through the lens of DCV which helps in
generalizing the results in future. The capabilities for BDPA help
startups to gain profits and improve their social and financial health
of the firm. We also concluded that while organizational culture plays a
significant role in controlling how BDAC translates into FP by making
the firms compete with their counterparts. The results challenge the
notion that innovation proves to be a moderator in explaining the
performance of the firm which has gained skills to deal with BDPA. We
are probably the first ones to theorize how the origin of the country
makes the firms perform better and how its time of existence in the
market does not impact its stature. Out study offers unique results when
it comes to explaining how Indian startups differ from their Chinese
counterparts. The study also offers counterintuitive arguments when it
comes to using innovation as a moderator in explaining competitiveness
and FP by adopting BDAC. In light of the same, the service provider of
big data and business intelligence firms should offer appropriate
training and other resources to keep the resourcefulness quotient high
for the startups.

The future of work: five steps to digital transformation in the age of
smart machines

Body

On the occasion of World Labour Day 2019, YourStory publishes this book
review on the evolution of artificial intelligence, its impact on jobs
and tasks, and how companies can successfully transform themselves for
the age of smart machines.

Frameworks of artificial intelligence (AI) in action along with case
studies and examples are well-described in the book What to do when
Machines do Everything: How to get ahead in a World of AI, Algorithms,
Bots, and Big Data. The authors - Malcolm Frank, Paul Roehrig, Ben
Pring - are from consultancy firm Cognizant's Centre for the Future of
Work. Their earlier book is Code Halos:How the Digital Lives of People,
Things, and Organisations are Changing the Rules of Business (see my
book review here).

The focus of the book is largely on digital transformation by
businesses, and not on work issues like minimum wages, employee
reskilling, government regulation, philosophical implications, and
ethical considerations. The core of the book is the authors' business
framework with the acronym AHEAD: automate, halo, enhance, abundance,
and discovery.

The 12 chapters are spread across 235 pages, and make for a
straightforward read. Here are my key takeaways from the book, and my
overview in Table 1 (below). See also my reviews of the related books
The AI Advantage,Human + Machine,Life 3.0,The Four,The Inevitable,The
Industries of the Future, and Machine, Platform, Crowd.

"The rise of AI is the great story of our time," the authors begin. They
define AI as "an area of computer science that focuses on machines that
learn." AI is not just about aping human behaviour, but creating the
next generation of intelligence and performance.

The authors explain that the book's focus is on pragmatic issues and not
philosophy or politics. Economic dislocation has always been part of the
First (loom), Second (steam), Third (assembly line), and Fourth (smart
machines) Industrial Revolution. AI will continue to amaze in the coming
years as it will be embedded almost everywhere and in everything.

I. Foundations

While reactions to AI tend to be polarised into utopian and dystopian
camps, the authors pitch for a more pragmatist view. The age of smart
machines is neither a capitalist's dream nor a worker's nightmare.
Alarmist stories and headlines have "tapped the nerve of insecurity."

The authors distinguish between three types of AI: narrow (weak,
applied, single domain; 'artificial narrow intelligence'), general
(diverse activities; 'artificial general intelligence'), and super
(technical genie). Cloud computing, ubiquitous networking, IoT, and
ecosystems of APIs are leading to exponential growth in AI capabilities.

Tech change and impacts proceed through three phases of 'S-curves' -
innovation burst, stall, and build-out. Rapid expansion followed by
maturity are accompanied by bubbles as well as 'golden ages,' according
to economist Carlotta Perez. AI is now moving from the fringe into the
mainstream as new business models and value chains are taking root, the
authors explain.

They show that the 'Republic of Digital' is now the third largest
economy in the world, after the US, and China. The authors present the
'3 Ms' framework for digital success: materials (data), machines (AI,
IoT, cloud), and models (new business models). New opportunities are
emerging for entrepreneurs and corporate innovators to fix problems and
frictions.

Digital technology is not just entertaining or convenient, but life
altering, the authors explain. AI has moved from "little daily helper"
to something more powerful and even disruptive, as shown in games of
intellect (chess, Go), driverless vehicles, robotic process automation,
radiology, and paralegal work.

Companies need to harness AI for the twin purposes of efficiency and
innovation. This can lead to personalised banking, individualised
education, effective healthcare, intuitive manufactured goods, efficient
supply chains, and cost-effective government services.

For example, GE has reinvented itself as a digital industrial company,
thanks to initiatives like the IoT management platform Predix. Education
is ripe for transformation; it has been criticised for not doing enough
for the top and bottom of the class; the "middle will muddle through" as
well. AI along with shuffling of student groups and different
offline-online interaction patterns can lead to more personalised and
social learning, according to New Classrooms Co-founder Joel Rose.

Automation

From factory settings to white collar offices, the transformation of
labour is now targeting knowledge activities like codification,
recombination, and repurposing of knowledge assets. AI can make
knowledge assets richer and lead to interesting and productive uses.

AI's impact will vary depending on the tasks within jobs, and along
different time lines and industries. "Don't confuse jobs with tasks,"
the authors caution. For example, for some jobs, RPA will eliminate only
some portions, especially routine and boring tasks. It will make workers
more effective, but not necessarily replace them.

"Our prediction is that AI will impact nearly 100 percent of knowledge
jobs, while completely eliminating approximately 12 percent of them,"
the authors explain. AI will eat existing jobs in a "slowly, slowly,
suddenly" manner.

The AI stack

Successful AI implementations focus on the "magic moments," deliver
individualised customer experiences, and suck up data continually from
internal and external sources. They connect data sets and empower
real-time decision-making at scale via new insights that are actionable
and proprietary.

For example, Netflix leverages recommendation engines, the app
interface, user data, and AWS infrastructure. It builds on open source
best-in-class systems, and can distinguish between what users say about
content (ratings) and what they actually watch (viewing behaviour).
Amazon has far more API mashups than Walmart, Target or Macy's,
according to the authors.

Data

"Like oil, data needs to be mined, refined and distributed," the authors
explain. Proprietary data, at scale, is the moat of competitive
advantage. "Once there's enough data to draw valuable conclusions, the
value of the data set increases exponentially," they add.

For example, First Data transformed itself from a maker of PoS devices
into smart terminals along with management tools and business
intelligence insights into customer loyalty. "This is truly becoming an
age of knowing it all," the authors enthuse.

Business models

Companies today need to compete at "Google speed" and with "Google
price." Millennials today have "defaulted to digital" and want
everything via an app. This is a challenge for incumbents with brands to
defend, and large tech and cultural inertia.

"Stability is to be admired, but in the digital economy such
considerations can lead to stasis," the authors caution. Digital
transformation helps companies become better, faster and cheaper. "The
winning business model will be hybrid - part physical, part digital,"
the authors emphasise.

Examples of service transformation include Uber (car as a service),
WeWork (space as a service), and GE (industrial uptime as a service).

Companies should not just pay lip service to digital. Creating a
standalone app without internal re-architecting is like trying to get to
the moon by climbing a tree, the authors joke. Priority should be given
to valid objective insights from data rather than just on personality or
position of established managers, or even opinions of experts.

Rather than "boil the ocean" of all data, it may be better to begin with
specific tasks and quick wins. Different industries are at various
stages of digital transformation; though the "melting points" may vary,
"digital denial" is pointless since such transformation is inevitable
across the board, the authors emphasise.

In a cross-industry survey, they present examples of such process
transformation under way in three categories: current, pilot and
considering. Examples include wealth management in banks, claims
administration in insurance, billing services in healthcare, and
merchandising in retail.

II. The AHEAD framework

Automation is one of the first steps in harnessing the power of AI. "RPA
is our new loom, our new steam engine," the authors explain. "Take X and
add AI" is the business plan of the next 10,000 Silicon Valley startups,
jokes Kevin Kelly, founder of Wired magazine.

There are a number of back-office and middle-office processes ripe for
automation, the authors observe. This includes departments like customer
service (complaint and help desk management), IT (software asset
management), HR (claims management), and finance (compliance).

For example, the Associated Press has been publishing more than 20,000
software-written news stories a year. Emerging startups in automation
space are AiCure (clinical data science), Talla (HR) and NextAngles
(financial services compliance). Healthcare productivity automation
(HPA) provider TriZetto (acquired by Cognizant) automates high-volume
routinised work in the healthcare sector.

The authors advise automation of processes that are recurring,
routinised, and repetitive. Other candidates are tasks that generate or
handle large volumes of data, require low levels of empathy or low
demand for human judgment.

Halos of code need to be created by "instrumenting" everything to gather
data and deploy decisions, eg. via IoT. Examples abound in industrial
machinery (Bosch, Caterpillar, Boeing), athletic apparel (Nike, Under
Armour), automobiles (BMW, Tesla, Ford, Toyota) and even insurance
(Progressive, Allstate, Travelers).

Every "thing" is now a code generator, the authors enthuse. Code helps
"turn water into wine," as long as the tap of valuable data is always
on. At the same time, care should be taken to respect customer privacy
and give them a delete button. The role of a digital risk officer
becomes important in this regard.

Examples include GE (digital twins), Discovery health insurance (also a
wellness company, by promoting healthy lifestyles via wearables and
apps), Iora Health (health coaches, outcome management), and New
Classrooms (design thinking in classroom activities).

Enhancement of human performance is possible via smart tools, data
insights and automation. From the stone age to the digital age, human
performance has been continually amplified by tools. Tools have lifted
us "from the savannah to the Sea of Tranquility" on the moon, the
authors explain.

Higher velocity of decision-making can lead to greater user
gratification. Using technology to automate some customer-facing tasks
opens up opportunities for greater creativity by customer service staff,
eg. in Zappos, Apple, Pret A Manger. Applying the human touch, bringing
a sense of fun, displaying empathy during tough customer moments, and
showing generosity of spirit are tasks that are best done by humans,
acting along with smart machines.

ImagineCare's predictive services enhance the competencies of doctors.
McGraw-Hill's ALEKS (Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces)
establishes a unique pathway and cadence for each student, with
assessments in real-time and not just at the end of the semester.
Playing against AlphaGo even led champion Lee Sedol to come up with new
types of moves.

In terms of physical capabilities, exoskeletons have been built by
Panasonic (for lifting heavy weights), Ekso Bionics (to help paraplegics
walk), and Sarcos (for defense personnel). For office workers,
enhancement is offered by Signac (detecting unlawful trading), and
Avicenna (improving radiology diagnosis).

Abundance or democratisation of goods has been made possible by
successive waves of innovation over the centuries: clothing (loom),
travel (steam engines), and manufactured goods (assembly lines). What
were once regarded as luxuries became affordable and ubiquitous. The
authors predict that similar trends will appear in financial services,
education and entertainment, thanks to smart machines.

"Obsess about the startup community," the authors emphasise. Market maps
of startup activity help business leaders understand the transformations
in fintech, healthtech, insurtech and govtech. Even though some of the
initial offerings may look inferior, flawed or even irrelevant, there is
a lot to learn from the successes and failures of startups, the authors
advise.

Makerspaces are other sources of useful insights, blending engineering,
design, creativity, and entrepreneurship. "Innovation is inherently
messy, but it needn't be chaotic," the authors explain.

There is both an art and a science to innovation. Useful planning
approaches are McKinsey's three horizons (current, short-term,
long-term), or even the LVMH model (60 independent subsidiaries, which
may even compete with one another).

Provocative exercises suggested include asking your sharpest employees
how to put your own company of business, or envisioning how the business
would be restructured so that your current premium offering is sold for
free or only at 10 percent of the price.

A strong focus on metrics also helps ("digital Taylorism"). For example,
sensors, software, process re-design and analytics have helped Narayana
Health Care make heart surgery more affordable without loss of quality.

Discovery via R&D, process analytics and portfolios are key for
innovation management in the digital economy. Such initiatives should
include top-down and ground-up approaches. Just as Edwin Budding's
invention of the lawn-mower in 1827 led to a boom in cricket, rugby and
tennis via grass courts, so also smart machines will open up vast new
unimagined possibilities.

"Innovation at the velocity and scale of AI" is the need of the hour,
according to the authors. Humans learn at linear rates, while machines
are learning at exponential rates, according to futurist Ray Kurzweil.

Companies need to blend incremental innovation (digital Kaizen) along
with moonshots in their portfolio. They need to think like VCs, with
hits paying for the misses. They will also need to learn to be
comfortable with failure as a source of learning; after all, the movie
and music industries have had their share of failures as well. Even
mighty companies like Microsoft and Apple have had some failed products
(Vista, Lisa), while others like RIM and Nokia have faced a reversal of
fortune.

For example, the University of Kentucky conducts surveys on students for
a predictive scoring system which helps improve retention rates. Toyota
is investing in driverless cars of the future, for which "AI is the
central technology" - as well as investing in traditional models.

Humans will have to continue to ask questions, be curious, imagine and
build, all using the new machines, the authors explain. Looking back at
how much the world has changed also helps get a sense of perspective,
eg. the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.

Leaders must be energised by the unwritten future rather than just
trying to hang onto the glories of the past, the authors urge. AI is the
ultimate game changer, and inaction will lead to irrelevance, the
authors sign off.

National Defense Industrial Association Issues Public Comment on DOD
Notice

WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 -- The National Defense Industrial Association,
Arlington, Virginia, has issued a public comment on the Department of
Defense notice entitled "Barriers Facing Small Businesses in Contracting
with the Department of Defense". The comment was written on Oct. 25,
2021, and posted on Oct. 26, 2021:

* * *

The National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) represents more than
1,600 corporate members and over 70,000 individual members from small,
medium, and large businesses. Our members and their employees feel the
impact of any policy change made in how the United States equips and
supports its warfighters. Our comments provided below come from this
diverse membership and represent a broad range of perspectives across
the defense industrial base (DIB).

In Vital Signs 2021, the Health and Readiness of the Defense Industrial
Base, we asked our membership what is "the most important thing that the
government can do to help the defense industrial base." The top three
responses were 1) streamline the acquisition process, 2) ensure budget
stability, and 3) enhance funding for R&D of emerging technologies. Our
comments reflect these concerns./1

Our intent in this comment is to document some of the critical barriers
that small businesses face in contracting with the Department of Defense
(DOD) and then to submit recommendations that DOD could implement to
attract more small business participation.

i. Government business practices that might inhibit or deter small
businesses' from producing and/or providing goods, services, and
materials for DOD requirements, to the detriment of the small business
sector and in turn the defense industrial base; 1) The U.S. Government's
regulatory burden of FAR and DFARS creates major barriers to potential
new small business and large business entrants. U.S. Government
regulations have attempted to give businesses relief by the allowance of
commercial item/services as defined in FAR 2.101 and elsewhere within
FAR and DFARS. In gathering data to support commercial items
procurements, Government contracting officers often seek data that is
subject to non-disclosure agreements between primes and their suppliers,
such as proprietary sales and pricing information. Demands for this type
of information can create significant challenges for all businesses but
can put small businesses in particular at risk. Additionally, the U.S.
Government's efforts to streamline the procurement process through
category management limits small businesses' ability to compete.

2) Profit margins and significant infrastructure requirements: Some of
our members have expressed that innovative high-technology small
businesses are not attracted to DOD business opportunities because of
low profit margins and significant infrastructure requirements (e.g.,
accounting systems acceptable to DCAA).

Recommendation: DOD should consider commissioning a study to benchmark
the margins of other industries to include changes over time.

ii. Regulations and business practices which may strain rather than
strengthen the relationship between the Department and small businesses;

1) The number of U.S. Government regulations is a barrier for small
businesses, and in-turn the flow-down of U.S. Government regulations
from prime contractors. In addition, the U.S. Government often imposes
numerous technology, quality and safety requirements, as well as
financial, quality and business process audits. The cycle time of the
U.S. Government acquisition process is slow and there are many
challenges along the way, so businesses with limited resources focus on
areas where sales are obtained more expediently, with lower transaction
expenses, and where profits rates tend to be higher.

iii. The impact of the Department's major programs to support small
business participation in the defense industrial base, specifically, the
Mentor-Protege Program, Indian Incentive Program, Procurement Technical
Assistance Centers, the Rapid Innovation Fund, Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR);

1) Mentor Protege Program. The success criteria for small businesses
participating in the Mentor-Protege Program (MPP), is primarily based on
whether the protege received increased subcontracts as a result of the
mentor's efforts. A number of MPP agreements efforts involve significant
training and assistance to the protege in Lean, Earned Value Management
(EVM), Quality Certification, etc. While mentors are an excellent
resource to provide guidance to a small business on what is needed to do
business with the mentor and other primes, the small business may still
be required to seek formal training and assistance from third-party
providers to obtain required certifications. Formal training can be cost
prohibitive for some "smaller" Small Businesses; however, without proper
certification, the small business remains at a competitive disadvantage
despite the MPP outcomes.

Recommendation: A collaboration of efforts between DOD, institutions,
mentors, and third-party providers to facilitate formal certifications
for Small Business.

The administration of tasks associated with the Mentor-Protege Program
is generally a long, arduous, and manual process. Electronic submittal
for applications and reporting is not available. Reporting requirements
may take a significant amount of time for the mentor and protege to
complete, which may deter a small business lacking the resources needed
to effectively participate.

Agencies seeking participation in the mentor-protege program may express
expectations that mentors develop proteges specifically to become prime
contractors, which a small business may not have the capacity to do;
meeting these expectations may create an awkward relationship dynamic
where a protege may be in a position to compete with its mentor. This
could be to the detriment of the relationship or partnership and
discourage participation in the program. |

2) Mentor Protege Program. Small innovative technology businesses have
great difficulty partnering with prime contractors in efforts to get
their innovative technologies fielded to the warfighters. Prime
contractors have little or no incentives to assist most of these small
businesses. This often results in very promising innovative technologies
never getting fielded.

Recommendation: DOD should consider expanding the mentor protege program
to include all small businesses. Doing so would provide significant
incentives for large prime contractors to enter into agreements with
small businesses to move promising innovative technology forward.
Opening the mentor protege to all small businesses and coupling it with
favorable treatment for prime contractors to allow them to receive sole
source SBIR Phase 3 contracts for procurement and sustainment of
innovative technologies developed by the small businesses under the SBIR
program would provide significant incentives for prime contractors to
partner with small businesses and further, to acquire the innovative
technology from the small businesses.

3) Excessive lag-time between award notification and contract award.
Lengthy time periods between notice of award on a contract and the
issuance of the contract drives small businesses away as the wait times
are not sustainable if the small business plans to keep employees paid
and working and keep the doors open. A good example is the period
between notification that the small business is being awarded a Phase 2
SBIR contract and getting the contract in hand and starting work. At
best the waiting period is four months and at worst 12 to 15 months.
Most small businesses have significant difficulty keeping principal
investigators and technical support staff working on other projects
while waiting for Government contracting officers to finalize the
contracts for the small business.

Recommendation: Develop a standardized contracting template for
Contracting Officers to use for issuing SBIR Phase 2, Phase 2.5, and RIF
contracts. Incentivize Contracting Officers to prioritize the issuing of
these contracts.

4) Insufficient funding level to fully employ small business employees.
SBIR funding is inadequate to keep the principal investigator and
technical support staff employed full-time on an SBIR project. Currently
a SBIR Phase 1 award may be $150K (cannot exceed $250K) with a 6-month
period of performance. The small business, using its' DCAA-approved
fully burdened rates, may assign a PI (principal investigator) and two
more junior technical support staff to the project. The six-month period
of performance offers 1040 labor hours per individual if assigned full
time to the SBIR project. If we assume the PI's fully burdened rate is
$250 per hour, and the two more junior technical project staff bill at a
fully burdened rate of $100 per hour, the six-month cost for the PI is
$260K, and each of the junior technical support staff is $104K, the
total rate for the three employees for working on the SBIR project full
time is $468K. The value of the Phase 1 SBIR contract is $150K. The net
result is that each of the staff members can only devote one-third of
their time (or less) to the SBIR project and their focus will not be on
developing the innovative technology the SBIR contract has been issued
for.

Recommendation: Increase the level of funding for SBIR Phase 1 contracts
to $500 thousand and increase the level of funding for SBIR Phase 2 and
2.5 contracts to $4 million. This will allow the small business to
allocate 100% of the PI's time as well as 100% of the technical support
staff to the SBIR project, and the result will be a dramatically
increased success rate for building prototype SBIR technology that has a
much better chance of being fielded for the warfighters.

5) SBIR solicitations are not in a consistent format across agencies.

Recommendation: Create a single consistent format across the Government
to allow contractors to better manage their SBIR programs.

6) Delay or Failure of DOD Program offices to transition Small Business
Innovative Research (SBIR) projects to a Program of Record. The SBIR
program is not being implemented the way it was designed. DOD invests
large sums of money awarding SBIR Phase 1 and Phase 2 contracts. One of
the requirements for SBIR Phase 2.5 funding is for the Program Office to
write a Technology Transition Plan (TTP) outlining how the Program
Office is going to POM for funds to bring the technology into a program
of record. Typically, this does not happen with the result that the
small business is faced with a funding gap of months to years in trying
to move the technology toward fielding with the warfighters. The Program
Office has several options, including SBIR Phase 3 (sole source
contracting) but the critical step is that the PM must actually follow
the TTP and POM for funding for integrating the technology into the
Program of Record.

Recommendation: Incentive Program Officers and civilian contracting
officers to address this barrier.

7) Documentation requirements are onerous - e.g., the requirement for
contractors to obtain proof of Native American Owned, Native Hawaiian,
or Alaska Native Corporation ownership. Certification in the System for
Award Management (SAM) should be sufficient. Requirements for additional
documentation could be managed by designating authority to Native
American Procurement Technical Assistance Centers to complete
verifications.

Recommendation: Create a more streamlined submittal processes or system
to allow electronic submittal of required documentations to route the
claim more quickly and efficiently. Program funding limitations, rebate
delays, and lack of process visibility (status in queue) may discourage
participation as not worth the effort.

iv. The use of past performance information during the periods of source
selection, ongoing performance, and collection of information;

1) Some small businesses are reluctant to share their past performance
because their customers have non-disclosure agreements which do not
allow information to be shared on the contract they support with their
customer. Even when nondisclosures agreements are not a hindrance, small
businesses are still reluctant to share customer names to discuss their
past performance because they do not want to exercise their customers
with unwanted requests for data, which may jeopardize their relationship
with their important customers.

vii. Contracting timelines and the impact of those timelines on small
businesses; The level of detail required to support many U.S. Government
proposals is costly, and the acquisition process (RFP to Award) is too
slow. Small businesses choose to focus on opportunities where they can
maintain a competitive cost structure and achieve higher profits with
repetitive business without the need to frequently submit updated
proposal information.

viii. The availability of skilled labor and other personnel to sustain a
competitive small business ecosystem;

A U.S. Government procurement requires additional staffing, systems, and
processes, which can make a small business less competitive overall in
the marketplace. Further, Government directed sourcing impedes Other
Than Small Business sourcing strategies for utilization of small
business subcontractors.

x. Policy recommendations or suggested executive, legislative,
regulatory action to foster more resilient supply chains, greater
competition in the defense industrial base, and/or more small business
participation during the procurement process.

1) We suggest that for Qualified Disaster Areas, incentivize Federal
agencies and Other than Small Business contractors to immediately engage
and support small businesses in qualified (catastrophic designation)
disaster areas by allowing them to receive additional credit towards
meeting contracting goals.

2) Allow certain small business subcontractors (e.g.,
veteran-owned/service-disabled veteran-owned small business
subcontractors) are allowed to retain "small business subcontractor"
status pursuant to Section 8(d) for a period of time after the small
business no longer qualifies as "small" due to a merger or acquisition.

3) Not-for-profit agencies not affiliated with Ability One: subcontracts
awarded to nonprofit entities for the blind or other severely disabled
individuals may be counted towards the OTSB Contractor's small business
subcontracting goal pursuant to Section 8(d) of The Small Business Act.

4(a). Collaborative mentoring, training and support is facilitated
through public-private partnerships between Agencies, PTACs, MPP
participants and third-party providers to help alleviate the financial
burdens administrative costs for protege participants under the MPP to
obtain necessary training and certifications (e.g., Quality, Lean, cyber
hygiene, etc.).

4(b). Existing MPP provisions under the government wide MPP are expanded
to include a pilot program for designated NAICS specifically for
"Emerging OTSBs" (mid-size business concerns).

5) The current Federal Acquisition Regulations and Cost Accounting
Standards were written in 1984 based on cost accounting methodologies in
use at the time. In 1985, Activity Based Costing was arguably invented,
the first of many advancements in cost accounting methodologies to come.
During the next 37 years, cost accounting has matured, in part thanks to
advances in computerized technologies. These developments allow
companies to select cost or pricing methodologies that are more
reflective of operations and are as easier and more cost effective to
administer. Of particular note are advancements in 1) the ability to
trace and predict a product's full lifecycle costs, from initial
development through environmentally conscious "take back" costs for
disposal or recycling; (2) the selection of the most appropriate cost
drivers to align costs based on better causal-beneficial relationships;
(3) the ability to more readily identify inefficiencies in business
operations.

Despite these advancements, the basic structure of the FAR/CAS
requirements remain unchanged. In many instances, FAR or CAS drives
contractors to adopt full absorption job costing, using methodologies
that are not necessarily the most appropriate for the business. It does
this through a variety of explicit and implied requirements, which
permeate both FAR (including agency supplements) and CAS.

Even though no one specific requirement in FAR or CAS explicitly
requires full absorption job costing, this is a de facto requirement,
when all the regulations and implementing policies are taken as a whole.

Even on U.S. Government contracts where FAR and or CAS is not directly
applicable, the cost accounting requirements of FAR/CAS influence
contracting officer, contract administrator, and auditor judgment to
follow full absorption job costing, due to trainings, policies, and
unintentional bias in favor of more familiar practices.

The unintended consequences of this root cause can be corrected by
modernizing the FAR, CAS, and implementing policy guidance. Those
unintended consequences include, but are not limited to:

* Small business and non-traditional contractors have significant
difficulty complying with cost-type contract accounting and
administration requirements. Because cost-type contracts are most
appropriate for contracts that are difficult to price, such as truly
innovative work, this has a disproportionate impact as a barrier to
entry on innovative startups.

* Costs and time of complying with cost accounting requirements of USG
contracts distracts the few back-office employees of small business and
nontraditional contractors from selling and performing contracts for
other customers. This is a significant barrier to entry.

* Established, mature, product lines and contractors who have multiple
preexisting U.S. Government contracts have a financial competitive
advantage in the cost/price volumes of proposals. This has a
disproportionate impact as a barrier to entry on innovative startups.

* Compounding that impact, in order to remain competitive and win new
contracts, many small and non-traditional businesses must self-disallow
significant indirect costs, taking them out of their bottom-line net
income or profit. Various studies suggest the number one reason that new
businesses fail is insufficient cash flow./2

Inadequate product pricing is another top ten reason for business
failure. This extra risk is a compounding enterprise risk and financial
barrier to entry.

* FAR-driven selection of inappropriate cost accounting methodologies or
cost-based pricing methodologies drives contractors to price Government
contracts in a method inconsistent with offerings to other customers.
This exposes the Government to risk of overpayment and exposes the
contractor to inadvertent compliance violations.

* FAR and CAS, taken as a whole, prompt Contracting Officers to
structure contracts and CLINs in ways that are frequently incompatible
with non-Governmental pricing. This creates additional barriers to
entry: 1) difficulty for non-traditional contractors to prepare
responsive proposals; 2) difficulty for non-traditional contractors to
prepare invoices that meet Contracting Officer expectations and can
result in lengthy delays in cash flow.

* Lower tier subcontractors in the supply chain are frequently unwilling
or incapable of accepting FAR/CAS flow down clauses related to contract
administration, especially for accounting or other Business System
requirements. This creates a significant barrier to entry for many
nontraditional and small business contractors, not just at those lower
tiers, but at higher tiers or prime levels, who cannot effectively
perform without those subcontractors.

* Many nontraditional and small business contractors do not have
dedicated audit support teams. To avoid the expense and interruption to
the business of diverting resources to costly audit support, these
businesses voluntarily self-disallow costs, to reduce the Auditable
Dollar Value (ADV) of their Incurred Cost Submissions, which typically
brings them into the "low risk" category. However, those write-offs are
a direct hit to profit, and discourages many nontraditional or small
businesses from continuing to do business with the Government. Through
word-of-mouth, this also has a deterrent effect on other contractors,
and creates a barrier to entry.

Recommendation: The Government should remove explicit preference and
implicit bias towards full absorption job costing in FAR and CAS. It
should also modernize existing requirements as relate to contract cost
accounting, evaluation of cost and/or pricing data, and solicitation or
contract structure, while leaving room for continuing modernization in
the future. For example:

* Divorce the delivery, inspection, and acceptance of a deliverable
product or service from the accounting functions under a contract (e.g.,
by revising the FAR 2.101 definition of "Line item"), to provide greater
flexibility for the contractor to use the most appropriate costing and
pricing techniques under the circumstances.

* As referenced in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act,
incorporate industry standards (e.g., GAAP) where feasible, and
otherwise provide for future flexibility as cost accounting continues to
evolve as a professional field.

* Leverage CPA-audited financial accounting data, e.g., from the Income
Statement or Profit & Loss Statement, in lieu of creating separate
requirements.

* Review Government syntax for Lines of Accounting (LOA), which were
last significantly updated almost 10 years ago for most buying commands
and modernize to: 1) leverage newer information technology and improve
comparability of USG spending across Departments and Agencies; 2)
minimize accounting adaptations required of non-traditional contractors
to generate adequate invoices; 3) increase efficiency for USG contract
administrators.

* Issue implementing guidance to contracting officers and auditors to
help them verify the contractor-selected cost or pricing methodologies
are (1) reasonable for the circumstances, (2) consistent with industry
best practices; (iii) consistently applied within each segregated
portion of the business, and not intermingled with inconsistent
methodologies which could inadvertently skew results.

xi. Any additional comments from small businesses relevant to the
assessment of supply chain resilience required by E.O. 14017, E.O.
14036, and E.O. 13985." 1) Competitive pricing is achieved by competing
manufacturers. The government should consider sourcing to specification.
Sourcing to specification is an approach that the government has
successfully used in the past. A specific example is the common handheld
radio. The government provided the specification, and each vendor needed
to qualify its offering to that specification. This allows for multiple
sources of product and allows industry to compete as well as innovate
within each firm's area of expertise.

Recommendation: Establish a working group, consisting of industry,
technical and contracting personnel, to explore and pilot alternatives
to the current COTS hardware acquisition model.

2) The exclusion of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and procurements
under the simple acquisition threshold (SAT), make the Buy American Act
(BAA) requirements not applicable to more than 98% (volume) of Federal
material purchases. As written the BAA effectively applies only to 1)
construction 2) vehicles (including ships) and 3) major weapons systems.
The exclusions, driven by the desire for low cost, have led to offshore
manufacturing and eventually technology transfer to foreign nations.
They place U.S. small manufacturers at a significant disadvantage as
well as providing telecommunications and IT design technology to foreign
nations. These exclusions should be removed from the BAA allowing US
manufacturers to build the material U.S. innovators create.

Barriers Facing Small Businesses in Contracting with the Department of
Defense. If you or your staff have any questions, please contact Nick
Jones, Director of Strategic Programs, at njones@ndia.org

Newer, Feature-Rich Cars, Primarily Suvs Are Driving Sales In The
Pre-Owned Car Market - Vaibhav Sharma Founder & CEO CarzSo

Vaibhav Sharma, the Founder, and CEO of CarzSo in conversation with
Siddharth Shankar of BWBusinessworld talks about the challenges and
opportunities of the pre-owned car business.

With the Semiconductor shortage extending the waiting period of new cars
to over of 3months to 11months, rising raw material costs increasing the
prices of new cars, the used car market has witnessed positive growth.
While still being an unorganized market, a lot of used car startups have
started offering a wide choice of vehicles, financing options, reliable
and transparent pre-buying, and post-buying experience, leveraging
technology to buy and sell used cars online. CarzSo is one such startup
in the Indian used car market, a "Virtual" pre-own car dealership that
facilitates the buying & selling of used cars digitally. Vaibhav Sharma,
the Founder, and CEO of CarzSo in conversation with Siddharth Shankar of
BWBusinessworld talk about the challenges and opportunities of the
pre-owned car business.

How did the idea of starting CarzSo come about and how has the journey
been so far?

Being trained on "The seven habits of the highly effective people", I am
accustomed to learn from failures. My previous failed startup in
Healthtech "Carions Healthcare" (Creating EHR) during 2015-2016, was a
key stepping stone towards building CarzSo.

In 2016, I got an opportunity to work in the auto industry and always
working with an entrepreneur mindset, I understood the market and was
always keen on resolving the challenges identified (based on my tenure
and experience in the auto sector). CarzSo as a concept emerged in 2019,
when I moved out of Audi / Porsche and started brainstorming on these
challenges and the possible opportunities that arise consequently.

While brainstorming on the market opportunity, we realized that no
single player was offering online retail of pre-owned cars in India (in
2019). Further, we learnt that the digital pre-owned car market is
emerging as a game changer, especially with the Indian car industry set
to become third largest. Pre-owned car market being larger than the new
car market, growing at a faster pace, while also moving towards getting
organized presented a huge opportunity. Hence, we came up with a vision
of building India's first virtual showroom for auto industry; we planned
to bridge the gap between physical and digital sales of the car market
leveraging futuristic technologies like AR and VR. We wanted to lay a
solid foundation and be all set to scale up operations while staying at
the forefront as the sale of cars in India digitize.

Being a consumer-centric company, CarzSo offers convenient digital
experience through its online platform, we provide virtual tour of cars
as well as the convenience of transacting online and offline. For
instance, a customer can browse the car on CarzSo's virtual showroom and
can make the final purchase on its physical store (or vice versa).

In order to evaluate our business model, we initiated operational
testing in the pre-pandemic phase of 2020, and despite the challenges
faced during the pandemic, the response was positive. The focus from the
beginning of 2021 was to further amplify team building and operations.
Further along, by getting young, dynamic and experienced professionals
on board from the auto, tech, finance and banking industry helped us
further augment our business.

We plan on opening multiple specialty stores including Superstores in
Tier 1 cities (with 300-500 cars inventory), Express stores in Tier 2
cities (with 50-100 cars inventory) and Virtual stores strategically
focused on various consumer segments to promote online retail of cars.

There are multiple players operating in the same domain. In this highly
competitive market, how does CarzSo stand apart?

CarzSo is working with a vision of becoming a Virtual retail store for
the Indian auto sector.

Growth in the Indian pre-owned cars market is expected to be driven by
the rural sector as well as tier 2 & 3 cities, and within the entry
segment ("one of the key markets wherein other competitors aren't
focusing"), and we have built a strong business presence in non-metro
cities.

* We launched our first express store in Ambala (Tier 2 city with a
reach to rural and Tier 3 cities) and received a very positive response

* We are now focused on further scaling up operations building India's
first superstore of pre-owned cars in Gurugram and are also committed to
opening multiple virtual stores strategically covering Tier 2 cities
(with a reach to rural and Tier 3 cities) of Haryana starting from
Karnal

We are also working on a strategic tie-up to support our customers with
the best financing options, wherein we will soon start offering very
attractive finance rates for the customers along with the buyback
options at attractive pricing.

The pandemic has introduced numerous changes in the auto sector; how do
you feel this has impacted the consumer sentiments in your domain?

The pandemic has impacted the pre-owned cars market positively; there
have been several growth-driving factors:

* The demand for personal mobility is rising, while the global
semiconductor chip shortage is resulting in longer waiting for new
cars - the waiting period is ranging from 2-3 months to as high as 12
months for certain models and variants. This is leading to a rise in
demand for used cars, while also resulting in a surge in the pricing of
pre-owned cars due to a surge in overall car demand.

* In the pre-covid era of car shopping, most consumers used to enquire
about cars physically, however, with the onset of the pandemic,
consumers are moving towards online transactions.

How has the growth been for you - a journey of offline business to
phygital showroom?

It has been quite a difficult journey - much more exciting than
expected. We started testing the market in Q1 2020, which is when Covid
hit us and during that period testing a physical business with limited
capital and team was very difficult. We worked hard just ensuring that
we are moving forward, sometimes the result wasn't immediate but sooner
than later our efforts started paying off.

* With limited capital, we focused on the physical operations and after
a positive cash flow (within 3 months of launching the actual
operations), we started investing our profits in building technology.

* CarzSo was launched with a vision of taking the pre-owned car sales
online, and we wanted to offer a mix of virtual and physical sales which
is a more efficient and convenient way for the customers to buy a car.
Further, people are increasingly exploring and preferring online car
buying options driven by the pandemic, therefore, we started working on
building a virtual model, wherein customers can view cars virtually in
real-time irrespective of their location.

Are you funded? If not, any plans to raise funds?

So far, putting first things first we were mainly focused on building
the right team, while scaling both physical and digital operations to
build a business model that is automated to achieve maximum possible
growth with limited capital available and be ready for a SpaceX launch
as we scale up.

Believing in working with an end in mind, we have been working hard with
specific month-on-month targets and will soon consider raising external
capital.

Can you share plans regarding your expansion in the next 1 year

* We are extensively working on improving our online platform, by adding
multiple features to enhance the customer experience for online car
sales, while also boosting the Virtual pre-owned car showroom
experience. We are further working on amping up our overall technology
to support the future of auto retail.

* We will be launching three superstores of pre-owned cars and multiple
express stores.

* We are also planning on launching multiple virtual experience stores
to improve our presence in Rural, Tier 2 & 3 cities, promoting online
sales of pre-owned cars.

Elaborate on the present market scenario. What kind of business
opportunities do you see in this segment?

With the Indian pre-owned car market standing at USD 27 billion in
2020 - expected to witness a 15% CAGR over 2021-2026 - the sector is
heaving with possibilities

The growth in the market entails various opportunities:

* As more options for personal mobility come into picture with
social-distancing risks looming large, pre-owned vehicles are no longer
stereotyped with downsized social status, presenting huge growth
opportunities

* The organized pre-owned car market is the fastest-growing channel in
India, and is reaping benefits of the changing customer preferences
(partly driven by cannibalization of the consumer-to-consumer and
unorganized channels); although small, the organized channel is
competitive, compelling players to offer new-age solutions across the
physical and digital plane for buyers and sellers. The market is on its
way to getting organized driven by rising access to digital listings as
well as increasing number of dealerships in the organized and
semi-organized channels.

* The role of digitization in the pre-owned car transactions has been
profound, which is seen in the rapid increase in pre-owned car-related
search queries - online used car platforms in India are looking to
capitalize on this opportunity by using technology to offer consumers a
convenient way of finding used cars across different budget brackets

* Financing presents another opportunity in the market; loans and other
value-added services (insurance, warranty, maintenance etc.) easily
available in the new car segment aren't widely available in the used car
business. Greater customer engagement and fast-tracked approval of loans
through improvements in captive financing can perhaps accelerate growth
in the sector

Any new trend you see in the pre-owned car segment in 2022?

* Rural markets, along with tier 2 and 3 cities are likely to play a
critical role in driving business volume in the pre-owned car sector;
the availability of multiple options across segments and budgets offers
opportunities to people across these segments to own cars, which
otherwise seemed difficult, considering the per capita dynamics of
Indian economy.

* Consumers are increasingly looking for a safe, transparent and
convenient option with negligible risk while purchasing used cars. The
growth in consumers' demand will be enabled by the organized pre-owned
cars sector.

* The market will witness a digital push mainly driven by customers'
preference to limit physical visits for car busing in the wake of Covid;
the accelerating trend of digitization will lead to an increasing share
of sales through digital classifieds; digital platforms will gain
further traction due to their wide reach, accessibility and ability to
provide a variety of options.

* The market is likely to receive a boost from first-time buyers on the
backdrop of the pandemic, primarily due to the restricted availability
of public transport, and increased need for personal mobility. There is
an accelerated demand for pre-owned cars, mainly due to increasing
urbanization and nuclearization which is further expected to provide
impetus to the need for personal mobility.

* Newer, feature-rich cars, primarily SUVs are driving sales in the
pre-owned car market; due to the intermittent launches, SUVs are seeing
faster replacement cycles. Intermittent model launches and feature-rich
competitively priced vehicles will likely aid the shift towards SUVs in
the pre-owned car space.

Share some data around the number of cars sold for far, revenues, cities
tapped for far, etc

* Having launched our first express store in Ambala, we have a presence
across the rural areas and other tier 1 and 2 cities adjoining Ambala;
we also have widespread operations across Gurugram, and are planning to
launch multiple virtual stores starting from Karnal - to further
concentrate on non-metro cities and adjoining rural areas

* Further, in Gurugram, we are launching India's first Superstore of
preowned cars

* Having a solid base of customers, we are on target to reach 1,000
customers by the end of this FY

* Witnessing a steady growth in revenues, we have been growing at a
consistent rate of 33% month-on-month this FY

CarzSo is a startup in the used car industry and is already popular in
rural and Tier 3 cities. To understand the business better and about the
used car market, we speak to Vaibhav Sharma, the Founder and CEO of
CarzSo.

The used car market is witnessing positive growth as owning a new car is
expensive, given the cost of insurance, tax, and the waiting period.
However, new models are making their way into the used car market and so
are premium luxury brands. The wide choice of vehicles, financing
options, and the value of used cars have made them popular.

With used cars becoming a popular choice, used car dealerships have also
evolved, becoming more tech-focused, leveraging the power of the
internet to sell cars. One such brand in the Indian market is CarzSo, a
"Virtual" dealership for pre-owned cars. To know more about the
business, we speak to Vaibhav Sharma, the Founder and CEO of CarzSo.

Speaking to Vaibhav about how CarzSo became a business idea, he said,
"Being trained on "The seven habits of the highly effective people", I
am accustomed to learning from failures. My previous failed startup in
Healthtech "Carions Healthcare" (Creating EHR) during 2015-2016, was a
key stepping stone towards building CarzSo." He added, "CarzSo as a

a virtual showroom for the auto industry. The plan was to bridge the gap
between physical and digital sales of cars, leveraging technologies like
AR and VR. "We wanted to lay a solid foundation and be all set to scale
up operations while staying at the forefront as the sale of cars in
India digitise," said Vaibhav.

Speaking about CarzSo's presence in India, Vaibhav said, "We began our
operations in Ambala and later on went to expand our footprint across
tier 1 and 2 cities adjoining Ambala. Now we have operations across
Gurugram and are planning to launch multiple virtual stores starting
from Karnal - to further concentrate on non-metro cities and adjoining
rural areas. Further, in Gurugram, we are launching India's first
Superstore of preowned cars."

CarzSo plans on opening multiple speciality stores, including
Superstores in Tier 1 cities (with 300-500 cars inventory), Express
stores in Tier 2 cities (with 50-100 cars inventory), and Virtual stores
focused on various consumer segments to promote online retail of cars.

Touching upon the topic of how CarzSo is different compared to the
competition in the segment, Vaibhav said, "We believe that the pre-owned
cars business is about procuring the right quality car at the right
price, and we are a procurement-focused business. This helps us to
ensure customer satisfaction at its best." Vaibhav said that the growth
in the Indian pre-owned cars market is expected to be driven by the
rural sector and tier 2 and 3 cities, which competitors are not focusing
on, while CarzSo has built a strong presence in non-metro cities. He
added, "We are also working on a strategic tie-up to support our
customers with the best financing options, along with the buyback
options at attractive pricing."

The pandemic had varying levels of effect on different businesses,
however, "it impacted the pre-owned cars market positively," said
Vaibhav. He said the demand for personal mobility is on the rise, while
the global semiconductor shortage is adding to the waiting period for
new cars. He added, "The waiting period is ranging from 2-3 months to as
high as 12 months for certain models and variants. This is leading to a
rise in demand for used cars, while also resulting in a surge in the
pricing of pre-owned cars."

Highlighting a few trends in the used car industry, Vaibhav points out
that SUVs are the driving force of the pre-owned car market. "Newer,
feature-rich cars, primarily SUVs are driving sales in the pre-owned car
market; due to the intermittent launches, SUVs are seeing faster
replacement cycles. Intermittent model launches and feature-rich
competitively priced vehicles will likely aid the shift towards SUVs in
the pre-owned car space," commented the Founder of CarzSo.

Another trend that Vaibhav feels is interesting is the digital
transformation the industry is seeing. He said, "The market will witness
a digital push, mainly driven by customers' preference to limit physical
visits for car buying in the wake of Covid. The accelerating trend of
digitisation will lead to an increasing share of sales through digital
classifieds; digital platforms will gain further traction due to their
wide reach, accessibility and ability to provide a variety of options."

ANNOUNCER: Americans Held Hostage, Abandoned Behind Enemy Lines, Day 44.

HANNITY: Americans held hostage 44 days behind enemy lines. No light and
sight for them to get out. Hundreds of Americans, legal residents with
green cards, they have the right to be here. All of their families,
thousands of our Afghan allies -- yup, they remain abandoned behind
enemy lines.

Joe Biden -- he's turned the page, we will not forget.

Sadly, the situation on the ground, it gets worse every single day.
Taliban terrorists are now once again hanging people in the public
square. But they're doing it very professionally and business-like,
according to the Biden administration. Including one man who is
reportedly strung up from a tall crane right in the middle of the city
-- professional and business- like. We've turned the page.

As we speak, anyone who assisted the U.S. in any way is being hunted
down and will soon face a similar fate.

Sadly, Joe Biden is not working at all to lift a finger to rescue our
fellow citizens. In fact, he's barely working in on anything at all.
Last week, four days on the job, jets off to Camp David, another restful
weekend.

Today, they call a lid at 2:48 p.m. in the afternoon after refusing to
answer any questions about Afghanistan, the crisis at our southern
border, begging OPEC for more oil production -- you know, the usual
things that he ignores, or the horrific state of the economy.

Take a look.

REPORTER: How would you define "success," legislatively, by the end of
this week?

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, it may not be by the
end of the week. I hope it's by the end of the week. But as long as
we're still alive and long we got three things to do: the debt ceiling,
continue resolution and the two pieces of legislation. We do that, the
country's going to be in great shape.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Just walks off, you know, like a robot. He's not allowed to
answer questions, he gets yelled at.

And tonight, instead of addressing the crisis at the border, the Biden
administration, they are outright lying, deflecting, hoping the crisis
will magically resolve itself like Afghanistan, we just won't pay
attention anymore. Joe Biden thinks he did a great job in Afghanistan.
He did not.

The same with the border. For example, in March, Biden's Homeland
Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas proclaimed the border was closed
and he said, quote, we are expelling families, we are expelling single
adults. He was lying to you the American people.

The following months, more than a million and a half illegal immigrants
have poured across that border illegally and, of course, Mayorkas
refuses to even now use the term "illegal alien" or "illegal immigrant".
Instead, he calls them undocumented non-citizens -- keyword
"non-citizens".

For months now, these undocumented non-citizens or illegal immigrants or
aliens have been dispersed all over the U.S. with little to no vetting.
For example, almost everyone in the recent wave of Haitian migrants,
they were admitted into the U.S. without so much as a simple COVID test,
because they're not going to be here very long. That would be another
lie. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: How many have been released into the
U.S.?

ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, DHS SECRETARY: They're released on conditions and
approximately I think it's about 10,000 or so, 12,000.

WALLACE: Have been released?

MAYORKAS: Yes.

WALLACE: And of the 5,000 that are still in process?

MAYORKAS: We will make determinations whether they will be returned to
Haiti based on our public health and public interest authorities.

WALLACE: So are we talking about a total of 12,000 or could it be even
higher?

MAYORKAS: It could -- it could be even higher. The number that a return
could be even higher.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: I want to be clear about one thing. I'm actually 100 percent,
I'm pro-legal immigration. All four of my grandparents, they came here
from Ireland. Like so many immigrants, they were dirt poor. Both my
parents grew up with next to nothing. Irish Catholics, they faced
discrimination at the time. And I knew -- I know I stand on their
shoulders, I'm grateful.

Now, if you're an immigrant, I'll be very honest. I don't care what
country you come from, what continent you come from. I don't care what
you sound like, what you look like, we're all God's children.

But no country on earth is without borders. People have got to respect
our laws, our borders and our sovereignty, period, no exceptions. We
must be a nation of laws. In fact, most countries have very strict
immigration laws.

Look at this, in Australia, asylum seekers, they're not even allowed on
shore. They will stop you and they will take you to a camp in a
different island, they'll give you food and water and medical assistance
if you need it, and then they'll send you home.

It is so difficult for these refugees to ultimately immigrate to
Australia, that the U.S., they've been resettling Australian-bound
migrants stuck in offshore asylum camps near Australia's mainland. They
refused to take illegal immigrants. They uphold the law in their
country.

Meanwhile, in western Europe, you have a record high asylum seekers in
2016. Denmark, they said enough's enough. Then they took steps to stop
and process migrants again offshore.

And many other countries, you know, citizenship is such of how high
worth, immigrants will pay and purchase citizenship. By the way, some
Americans they give up their citizenship and buy citizenship in other
countries, because why? Citizenship, especially to this country, is of
great value for people coming from countries that do not have the
freedoms we often take for granted.

When you look at St. Lucia, for example, it's roughly about 250 grand.
You can get a passport and be a citizen.

Dominica, the price tag is a hundred thousand per passport. Antigua,
Barbuda, yeah, it's about a little over 134 grand. Cyprus is asking a
whopping two and a half million, they call them donations and
investments and you can buy citizenship.

In New Zealand, you've got to invest two million dollars over four years
and be there x number of days. Malta, it's $1.1 million in investments
and donations. Even Canadian residency, you can purchase residency for a
few hundred thousand bucks worth of government bonds.

Citizenship is a valuable coveted thing all around the globe. America,
the greatest country in the country, how much would people pay to be a
citizen here. Maybe we should also get in on this action, and maybe
charged people to be citizens. Every other country appears to be doing
it.

Here in the U.S., where we let in more immigrants than anywhere else on
Earth, we don't ask for a penny. Instead in theory, we merely ask
immigrants to follow our laws and we need to do more.

For example, I don't care where you come from, everybody coming into
this country should undergo a security vetting to make sure you don't
have radical associations. In the middle of a pandemic, it would be a
pretty wise thing to make sure we do a health vetting, so you're not
COVID positive or don't have any other disease. In most cases,
immigrants also should prove they have the ability if we're generous
enough to invite them in, that they have to be able to take care of
themselves financially not be a burden on the American people.

We cannot put that burden, we can't afford to put that burden on the
American people. Ideally, they would also possess a coveted skill or a
trade. We can't drive the wages of American workers down either.

Unfortunately, Democrats block Donald Trump's merit-based immigration
bill like they have in countries like Australia. Now, Joe Biden is
refusing to enforce any of our existing immigration laws. He's not only
enforcing the laws, he's aiding and abetting the law breaking, which he
swore not to do.

No background checks, no health checks. Many are a huge financial burden
to you the American taxpayer we just can't afford Joe Biden's open
borders and his lawlessness. Our southern border is a free-for-all. He's
made it that way.

The administration doesn't know exactly who they're letting in, just a
future requested court date -- it's a requested court date. They don't
even require you to appear now under Joe Biden. In other words, most
immigrants, they're not going to -- they're not going to abide by the
request, they don't have to. This has massive security implications.

And as once -- the once lucid Joe Biden stated in 2007, much different
Joe Biden than we see today, no country can be secure without
controlling their borders. Let's listen to Joe back in the good old
days.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: What do I think about the control of our borders, what would I do
about it? Ladies and gentlemen, no great country can say it is secure
without being able to control its borders, period. What I would do about
it was that I proposed to do about it almost 13 years ago. I would
radically ramp up the number of border security guards we have, the use
of electronic surveillance material we have to guard the border and a
number of what they call virtual fences.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Joe Biden we see today looks pretty weak, frail and is a
cognitive mess in comparison, isn't he? But that's a sideshow.
Unfortunately, Biden now cares less about a secure America and more
about the radical socialist base that is the modern Democratic socialist
party, because that's socialist base, they don't believe in borders and
whether they put any value on it. They want a complete, unfettered
immigration no matter what.

Now, why, ask yourself, the Democrats they try to sneak amnesty into the
Senate reconciliation bill, free citizenship -- until the Senate
parliamentarian stepped in -- that's something of great value for
Democrats? Is it their hope that, oh, we're going to give you something
that other countries charge hundreds of thousands if not millions of
dollars for, we'll give it to you, but you're going to vote Democrat,
right, and you're not going to vote for those mean, old Republicans that
follow the law and believe that you should respect our law and our
sovereignty and our borders, you're not going to vote for them. I don't
care where you come from, just do it legally.

Forget that mass migration drives down wages for low-income workers,
forget the health and security implications in the middle of a pandemic,
forget the abuse, the rape, the human trafficking that goes on during
these massive caravans through Mexico and other countries, forget the
mass migration drives down all of these wages, et cetera, et cetera.

You know, all of this - you know, is done again and again and again and
Joe Biden has no clue. Apparently, none of these things matter to the
radical left.

So instead of securing the border and telling migrants not to come,
Biden is deflecting, he's lying and he's blaming everyone else,
especially Donald Trump, blaming the border patrol agents on horseback,
falsely accusing them of whipping migrants. Even the photographer that
took the picture said that didn't happen. That is a lie.

Now, the border patrol union, the agents are fighting back and they're
demanding an apology. He's blaming Congress for not passing
comprehensive immigration reform. Joe, you're the president, you get it
done. You have both houses of Congress and your party runs the whole
show. That's also a lie.

Donald Trump controlled the borders we had what a 40-year low of illegal
immigrants, why because he put in place measures like building a border
wall, stay in Mexico policy, ending catch-and-release, which you have
now turned into process and release, All of this and more.

Biden is also blaming Trump for directly handing him a god-awful mess at
the border. No, he actually handed you secure borders. He also handed
you energy independence. He also handed you a world that was secure, an
Afghanistan that was secure.

And Joe even blamed the weather claiming that the migrant surge was
seasonal and would end during the summer months that actually got worse.
And I can report the migrant surge didn't end during the summer. It
continues this day, August, 200,000 people alone.

Our own Griff Jenkins at in Mexico tonight traveling north with the
latest wave of migrants.

Griff, looks like it's not stopping at all.

GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: No signs of slowing down, Sean,
and we are here in Tapachula Mexico. It's the southernmost Mexican town,
along the Guatemala border. And every single one of the 15,000 Haitians
that crossed into Del Rio last week came right through this town center
where I am standing.

If you just look over my shoulder, Sean, you can see Haitians already
gathering here. And tonight, Mexican officials confirmed to FOX News,
Sean, they are preparing for an onslaught of a caravan of as many as
migrants gathered in Colombia headed this way, mostly believed again to
be Haitians.

Now, let us show you a little bit of video from earlier today when we
were outside the refugee office. Officials say there are already some
10,000 Haitian migrants right now in town trying to get asylum papers
and work permits. But ultimately, their goal, of course, is to get to
the U.S.

Now, let me show you a picture we shot of a migrant man we met here on
the streets behind me. You can see the shirt "Biden let us in". That's
the same shirt, Sean, we saw in Tijuana months ago. And clearly
motivated by this administration and President Biden's open call that
now is the time to come.

Now, we spoke to several Haitian migrants who told us this pipeline from
south America to Texas is anything but slowing down. Take a listen to
what they said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: More Haitians are coming. And the Panama, Colombia,
yeah, are coming. I see a lot of Haitians here. A lot of people are
Haitian, living in Mexico, in Tapachula. But it's not the destination.
The destination of all the people who are Haitian is in United States.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

JENKINS: Sean, Mexican officials also told me they've never seen
anything like this. I told them I was here in 2019, during those
caravans. Is it worse than that? They said it pales in comparison.

So much so, we've learned that tomorrow morning, they will open up a
soccer stadium to begin processing the migrants, because it's such
overwhelming numbers -- Sean.

HANNITY: All right. Griff Jenkins in Mexico tonight, thank you.

Joining us now, former Texas governor, former energy secretary, Rick
Perry, our friend.

I was down at the border a number of years ago with you, as bad as it
was then, it's worse now. We've had Governor Abbott on the program a lot
of times. He's called up the National Guard. He's allocated $3 billion
in Texas funds, Texas taxpayers paying, he's actually created miles of
his own wall using patrol cars from law enforcement, and he's at every
step of the way, his battle is really with the federal government aiding
and abetting the law breaking. What other options does the governor have
at this point?

RICK PERRY, FORMER TEXAS GOVERRNOR: Sean, let me just say one thing
before we get off on to that. Thank you for telling the American people
the truth. As I flip through channels, it's really difficult to find the
truth about what's going on on the southern border.

This is a devastating wave that's hitting our southern border. This
administration is lying about it, and I think it's really important that
that you and your network, others, tell the truth and hold Joe Biden
accountable, hold Mayorkas accountable.

I mean, they're literally looking in the face of the American people and
lying to them about what's going on on that southern border.

HANNITY: Yeah, outright lying.

(CROSSTALK)

PERRY: -- families who are being devastated because of this.

HANNITY: Right.

PERRY: And, you know, maybe what we ought to do is just hire every bus
that we can we can hire in the state of Texas, hire every charter
aircraft, bring the National Guard C-130s to the border and load these
individuals up and take them to Maryland and leave them there and maybe
--

(CROSSTALK)

HANNITY: Why don't we leave them at Lafayette in D.C.?

The reality is, you know, you're hitting on something important here,
Governor, or Secretary, I don't know what you I don't know which you
prefer whatever title you like, you own them all. But the important
thing is, is once they're here and Joe lets them in, we don't have the
ability to deport them, because that's supposed to be the role the
federal government to enforce the law, they don't do it.

Then they disperse people, high rate of COVID positivity, no test, no
vaccine mandate all around the country, and then people come without any
money, then states bear the burden of food and shelter and education and
health care.

And we can we can't balance our budget, Governor. It's not -- it's not
complicated math here.

PERRY: Well, but the all of this big infrastructure bill is not going to
cost anything.

I mean, I heard that president look into the camera and say this is
going to cost zero and, Sean, that's lying to the American people. I
mean, he's playing Americans for chumps, and people who voted for him,
they need to really take a deep breath, think about what this individual
is doing to this country.

It is staggering what's happening along that border, the -- you know,
those have historically been Democrat voters in those counties along the
Rio Grande, I'll tell you one thing, they're rethinking that today and
they're looking at Joe Biden and going, this is potentially the biggest
mistake we ever made in our lives, to let this individual become the
president of the United States.

HANNITY: I'll add to that, abandoning Americans in Afghanistan when he
said he wouldn't.

Governor Perry, we always appreciate having you on. Thank you, sir.

Here with more nationally syndicated radio talk shows Dana Loesch.

Dana, I'm looking they're now putting the governors of these border
states like Arizona and Texas in a difficult position. Now, Governor
Abbott spending $3 billion Texas dollars. Governor Abbott is building
his own little wall with cars. Governor Abbott's called up the National
Guard.

But once Joe lets him in, Governor Abbott doesn't have the authority to
send them back, that's a problem.

DANA LOESCH, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO TALK SHOW: No, it is. And,
Sean, you're exactly right. I'm so glad that you pointed out that that's
Texas taxpayer dollars that's being used to do what the federal
government won't do, which I think that everyone in Texas should send an
invoice to Joe Biden and everybody who's responsible for this, Mayorkas,
and everyone else, because this is what our taxes are going to.

But you bring up a really good point and once -- once people are
illegal, once they've illegally entered, then really the governor has --
I mean, his hands are tied. You could say, and I'm of the position that
if the federal government's going to choose which laws that they want to
follow, I think that the Texas governor should be able to do as well.

I understand that people are trying to be above board and all this stuff
and avoid endless litigation, which is what the White House what the
administration would absolutely tie Texas up in. But at the same time,
you know, everyone's hands are tied. I mean what do you do after people
come in here illegally?

And then you have Border Patrol agents and, Sean, this is a huge point.
I'm so glad that you've been talking about Alejandro Mayorkas because
here's the guy who is not doing his job and he gets to keep his job,
Sean. He gets to stay as secretary of DHS.

But yet these border agents who were just riding horses on rough
terrain, and trying to do the best they could with an overwhelmed
border, thanks to this administration -- they're smeared, their
characters are impugned, they're ridiculed in front of the nation by
elected officials because they're not doing their jobs. I mean it's cats
and dogs living together, it's mass hysteria, it's crazy.

HANNITY: Let me ask you this: so you look at these other countries and
there's so many of them, they actually sell citizenship, or you invest
in real estate or you invest in business or you give a donation. You
know, we -- if Australia can charge millions and Cyprus can charge
millions, we could charge probably a fortune and make money, which I
don't think we should do. I'm an -- I believe in legal immigration.

But now we have an administration that aids and abets and law breaking.
They're assisting in this. If you did it, I'd have to you know bail you
out of jail with a cake and a file in it.

LOESCH: You, yeah, you would, Sean. You'd have to you have to bake me a
nice little cake and put a nail file in it for me to bust out. No,
that's true though. I mean every other country why is it that every
other country in on God's Green Earth is able to have borders and able
to have the sovereign process to determine who gets in -- who gets in
legally and who doesn't. But yet, the United States isn't afforded that
same opportunity that -- I mean, Mexico for crying out loud all these
other countries have very, very strong immigration laws.

But the United States -- and, Sean, you bring up a good point with us
and if I may the United States is such a unique country because we
recognize that our greatness comes from being able to unite around
freedom. We're not united around a faith. We're not united around an
ethnicity. We are united by the simple principle of liberty.

Do you want to be free? Yes or no? Start the process, observe the law,
we're all equal before the republic and underneath it when the law is
broken. That's how you become an American.

And we love that tradition. We love that. I don't know why Democrats
hate it so much.

HANNITY: It's a great question. Dana, we always appreciate you being
with us. Thank you.

All right. Straight ahead, an exclusive report about what Joe Biden
wants to do with your money this week. Big battle on Capitol Hill, we'll
give you all the details, we'll break it down. And Newt Gingrich will
weigh in, Larry Kudlow will weigh in and react to the bizarre claim that
the spending package won't cost us anything, $5 trillion won't cost you
a penny. Great math, straight ahead.

HANNITY: All right. Crunch time for Congress this week as Biden Schumer
Pelosi try and ram their radical, what ultimately really $5 trillion,
but $3.5 trillion tax increase, social spending package. It's now gotten
so big, so expensive now, even some Democrats, they're saying they won't
support it. I don't believe it until the votes are cast.

Our own Chad Pergram is standing by with the latest.

Where things stand tonight? I read this a civil war breaking out. I read
that, all right, Nancy has decided to go with the $1.2 trillion bill
first, then the $3.5 trillion, then the Squad threatening not to support
it. Where are we?

CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: There's a lot of discrepancies
about where they are right now. This is a mammoth agenda for the
Democrats. Democrats hope to transform the nation with this agenda.

Pelosi spoke to her caucus tonight, and she said her members are, quote,
idealistic.

Now, let's think about what they're trying to do here. This is more
ambitious than FDR's new deal programs and provisions of LBJ's Great
Society plan, and here's what's in the social spending package. $4
billion for distance learning, $12 billion for electric cars for federal
employees and postal workers on the job. A big provision to beef up IRS
enforcement.

The bill also provides money for paid family and medical leave, plus
billions for the environment. Liberals say the bill must remain at $3.5
trillion.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Two hundred and ten House Democrats want to pass
Biden's agenda, 48 senators do. There are a few holdouts. They need to
get on board. Of course, we're open to negotiation. There is not a red
line at $3.5 trillion. We need a counteroffer for those who are opposed
to the $3.5 trillion, which is Biden's agenda.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERGRAM: Democrats are fighting with themselves, notably moderate
Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): I mean, I would actually like them to make their
demands clear so that we can engage with that. It is saddening to see
them use Republican talking points. We obviously didn't envision having
Republicans as part of our party.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERGRAM: Moderate Democrats say this bill should probably be about $2
trillion. It must shrink if it's going to pass.

Now, tonight, in the Senate, Republicans block starting debate on a bill
to fund the government and also lift the debt limit. It needed 60 votes.
Republicans are saying to the Democrats, do it on your own if you're
going to spend all this money -- Sean.

HANNITY: All right, Chad, thank you.

And at all that chaos on Capitol Hill is just the latest crisis facing
the Biden administration. now, Joe's record of failure is starting to
catch up with him in the polls. Not only is he underwater on approval in
the latest Pew research poll, but a majority by the way of respondents,
56 percent -- yeah, they think Joe Biden is not mentally sharp.

And, by the way, I don't know who this other 40 percent are or what
you're thinking.

And by the way, the vaccine mandates that Biden is so eager to impose on
everyone, they could soon be having disastrous consequences for the
Democrats. Look at New York state, for example. They're preparing to
actually call up the National Guard to fill in for hospital workers, you
know, the ones in March and April and May of 2020 in the middle of the
COVID Schiff show of all Schiff shows -- yeah, they're thinking of
firing them, many that got COVID, that jumped on COVID grenades every
day to save the lives of their fellow citizens. Yeah, they're all about
to be fired for refusing to get the vaccine.

It sounds like Biden could have yet another crisis of his own making, on
his hands, before he even knows it. Here with reaction, author of
"Beyond Biden: Rebuilding the America We Love", I can hope and pray,
well-written book, I have my copy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, FOX News
contributor Newt Gingrich.

All right. We got to get beyond Biden. It's never been this bad. We
never abandoned Americans. We never begged OPEC to produce more oil,
giving up energy independence. You see the mess at the border. You see
inflation.

My question is, you see this fight going on with the Squad versus
so-called moderates, who wins?

NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think the country loses and
I think first of all, with very few exceptions, maybe Manchin and
Sinema, there aren't any real moderates in the Democratic Party. When
push came to shove in August, every single Democrat in the Senate, every
single Democrat in the House, voted for a big socialist bill that big
government socialist bill that Bernie Sanders wrote.

I mean, how can you have a clearer message than to have an open
socialist write a bill? Which, by the way, probably scores at $5
trillion, not $3.5 trillion. It has three trillion dollars in tax
increases, hires 85,000 new IRS agents to harass taxpayers, apparently
according to one reading provides for free community college for illegal
immigrants.

So all these people at the border will get to go to college at the
taxpayers expenses. Nothing's free, that means it's a taxpayer provided
college. It's a taxpayer provided health care.

And so, I think that this is going to be a fascinating week uh Pelosi's
been very tough she runs a dictatorship. She's been twisting arms. She's
now starting to break them. Presently, she'll start kneecapping people
and whether that's enough --

HANNITY: But it seems like the squad is basically saying it's our way or
the highway, and they have control over her speakership.

GINGRICH: Well, they only do in the sense that they have enough votes
that she probably can't pass a purely Democratic bill without their
votes. But, look, what they've done. For the last year, they've decided
everything by themselves. In fact, they even reached over and kicked a
Republican off a committee, something which had never been done before.
They created an investigating committee and they controlled Republican
appointees.

So, now, they turn, it's like it's like having somebody -- if your
teenage son or daughter had run off with a credit card ran around and
charged everything, bought a Ferrari, bought you know round trip airline
tickets, stayed at five star hotels, then showed up one morning and
said, gee, dad, why don't you pay all of my bills? And that's where the
Republicans are now saying no. We're not part of this. We weren't in on
the takeoff, we're not going to be on the landing, and the Democrats
have made no effort to reach out to the Republicans and actually try to
share power.

So I would ask --

(CROSSTALK)

HANNITY: All right. Here's my questions now --

GINGRICH: -- and Senate, be calm and see what happens.

HANNITY: I don't think any Republicans should vote to increase the debt
ceiling. They have the House, they have the Senate.

GINGRICH: Right.

HANNITY: They want to spend all this money, Republicans don't. There is
no opportunity to work with a Republican. I don't think one Republican
should vote to increase it by a penny.

Now, Democrats are going to say, oh, you're going to shut down the
government and the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is going
to be at stake, that's not true. They have control of Congress. They
have control of the purse strings. They get to decide.

So, it'll be up to them whether or not they raise the debt ceiling,
correct?

GINGRICH: Yeah, I mean, you know, if I were the Republican leadership,
I'd say, look, you can get our votes, drop the $5 trillion spending
bill, drop the $3 trillion tax increase, drop the idea of 85,000 new IRS
agents. You know, you want to talk about us helping you -- well, this is
what it's going to cost for us to decide to help you.

And if you don't want us -- if you don't want to meet us and negotiate,
why would we give you our votes? I mean, no Republican should vote for
the debt ceiling increase. That's the Democrats' problem. It is their
disaster and frankly, if they keep putting poison pills into the
continuing resolution, no Republicans should vote for the continuing
resolution and you have to very careful.

HANNITY: You have a great pulse of how things are working in D.C. It
seems like Democrats, the civil war is going on. So what happens in the
House? Will Manchin and Sinema hold the line? Because I think
ultimately, their arms are going to get twisted so hard, they'll
probably rip them out of the socket to get their votes.

GINGRICH: Well, I think they have a hard time doing that. They're
offering a bill which will destroy West Virginia's economy totally.
They're offering some ideas which are deeply opposed in Arizona.

Remember, big government socialism only has about 16 percent support.
One out of every six Americans.

Now, it may be that the lemming is replacing the donkey as the
Democratic Party symbol and they may all be about to run off a cliff
together. But I think this is going to be very unpopular in the country.
And my guess is they're not going to get it through because in the end,
they can't satisfy those who aren't moderates but they want to survive
and those who are radicals in districts where it doesn't matter. I think
it's an almost impossible job for Pelosi.

HANNITY: Did you ever think it'd get this radical, ever think we'd
abandon Americans across enemy lines?

GINGRICY: No.

HANNITY: Did you ever think we'd have that kind of chaos at the border?
Do you ever think that we'd be begging OPEC after we finally achieved
energy independence for to produce more oil and they turn us down?
Pretty embarrassing, Mr. Speaker.

GINGRICH: Look, I think you're faced with the weirdest political
coalition in modern American history. I think that they are totally out
of touch with reality. I think the damage they're doing is unimaginable
and I really worry that these guys could stumble into a big war not a
small war.

And I worry particularly about China because the Chinese dictatorship
has to be looking at this chaos and just thinking, this guy is old, he's
weak, he's confused, people under him are nuts. I think that's
dangerous.

HANNITY: It makes those -- it makes those Donald Trump tweets that
everyone in the mob, in the media characterized as mean seemed pretty
appealing actually about right now, because he actually -- he instilled
fear in other countries and he actually got us to energy independence,
controlled of the borders, lowered taxes and things worked better.

Mr. Speaker, thank you.

All right. Unfortunately, the Biden administration isn't just
incompetent, they're also wildly as we've been pointing out dishonest.
For example, Joe repeatedly promising he will not raise taxes on anyone
making less than $400,000 a year, even giving his word as a Biden. You
mean like you did to the people you abandoned in Afghanistan?

Okay, Joe, I don't really think your word as a Biden is worth very much,
considering what Hunter has done to your family name. Secondly,
corporations don't pay taxes. We pay them. And thirdly, we're now paying
a buck 50 more a gallon and we're paying more for everything we buy
because of your policies.

And he's also been telling a new lie that the massive tax hike and
spending bill will cause zero dollars, free. Okay, I know you probably
come from the era of an abacus, we actually have computers in this day
and age and it's hard to really believe that even you think that's true
as your party now is fighting each other on it.

Here with reaction, the host of "Kudlow" on the FOX Business Network,
Larry Kudlow is with us.

All right. Larry, your analysis if this economic bill gets passed, what
are the consequences?

LARRY KUDLOW, FOX BUSINESS HOST: Well, I think it's going to do great
harm to the economy. I mean, the tax hikes alone, as you say, companies
don't pay taxes, individuals pay taxes. So, by the government's own
scoring, the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Tax Committee,
neither of those are supply side havens. But they're saying 70 percent
of the corporate tax hike will fall on the blue collar middle class and
the Joint Tax Committee has said nearly 70 percent of the middle class
will see higher taxes as a result of the bill that came out of the House
Ways and Means Committee.

So, it's going to be devastating for the economy. Plus, you're raising
the capital gains tax, plus they're talking about taxing unrealized
gains which is remarkable. That's a new one historically.

But the other point I want to make, you know, Newt Gingrich was talking
about big government socialism -- look at, Sean, this massive wave of
new welfare and entitlements, nothing -- whether it's the family leave
plan or the basic income plan, universal basic income or these checked
at child credits and --

HANNITY: Free college.

KUDLOW: -- there's not one -- yep, free community college -- but there's
not one stipulation, not one rule that you have to work. There's no work
fare. There's no work requirements, and in fact, Sean, there's no
education requirements.

So, you've got massive welfare dependency. It's like the Great Society
to the -- I don't know 20th or 30th power. But that will damage the soul
of America. That goes to the heart of American culture.

You know, work is dignity. Work holds families together. Work provides
opportunities for the least among us, and this damage that they're going
to do and it's from the far left, it's from the crazy progressives, this
trade a crazy textbook. This is the thing that worries me the most.

I hate the tax hikes. I'm a supply-sider. I believe in the Laffer curve.
You jack up tax rates, you're going to get fewer revenues, not more.

But now, we're cutting into the heart of the American soul with all this
welfare dependency and Newt is right. It is big government socialism of
the worst kind.

HANNITY: Yeah, you know, we just got to see what happens. I think
they're going to have a harder time than they think passing it. So
they'll just start -- you know, okay, instead of 3.5, we'll go to 2.9.
Instead of 2.9, we'll go to 2.5.

We still can't afford it and all of it's going to be wasted and our kids
and grandkids will pay it for the rest of their lives.

Last 20 seconds.

KUDLOW: We don't -- we don't need this bill or any part of it, okay?
Even if it's a smaller bill. Sean, I'm saying to you, save America, kill
the bill. Save America and kill the bill.

We do not need this. It will harm our country at home and it will also
harm our country abroad because of the perceived weakness. K the bill,
Sean, that's the position I really want you to take.

HANNITY: Okay, repeat after me: kill the bill. I agree.

All right, Larry Kudlow, thank you.

KUDLOW: Yes, yes.

HANNITY: All right. Coming up, after they shamelessly defended him,
Biden actually attacked the media last week. Ari Fleischer, Mike
Huckabee, they're going to react to this bizarre outburst, straight
ahead.

HANNITY: All right. Now, after they helped him get elected and have
shamelessly defended him since he took office, Biden is actually
attacking the press. Here's what he said prior to his meeting with the
Indian prime minister. Take a look. This is on Friday.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: The Indian press is much better behaved in the American press. I
got to watch out. They'll (INAUDIBLE). I think with your permission, you
should not answer questions because they won't ask any questions on
point.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: And when pressed today on his refusal to take questions from
reporters, circle back Jen Psaki offered this pretty pathetic excuse.
Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REPORTER: As he sat down with Prime Minister Modi last week, the
president said that the Indian press is better behaved than the U.S.
press and then he advised him not to take questions. Can you explain why
the American president was criticizing U.S. reporters in that setting?

JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I would note first that he
took questions on Friday and he took questions again today, and I think
what he said is that they're not always on point. Now, I know that isn't
something that anyone wants to hear in here, but what I think he was
conveying is you know today, he might want to talk about COVID vaccine,
some of the questions were about that. He might want to talk about --
and some of the questions are not always about the topic he's talking
about in that day.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: All right. As he continues hiding from the press, Biden has
done only nine sit-down interviews, lagging way behind Trump and Obama
at this point in there term.

Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Ari Fleischer and former
Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.

OK, Ari, you did this gig before. He took a whopping four questions at
that big press conference. Four. That's all he took.

Then we constantly here, they lashed out at Boris Johnson. Now they are
telling the Indian prime minister, don't answered questions, and then
ask Joe questions. And then he keeps saying over and over, I'm going to
get in trouble. They don't -- I get yelled at. They get mad at me and
everything. And this is very bad for me. Bad.

ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, this follows a year-long
campaign, which is a strategy was to hide in the basement and
essentially take no questions from anybody. The few times he did take
questions, he got himself in a lot of hot water. Remember that time, he
talked to a black journalist and said, what are you, are you a junkie?

So when Joe Biden does speak his mind, his mind and his mouth get him in
a lot of trouble. So I understand the wrangling. There is going to
always be a difference between a White House and a press corps about
what the topic of the day should be. But ultimately, the White House
doesn't get to control the press's questions.

And the worst example of this is when the president right before the
July 4th holiday was asked about Afghanistan and the Taliban taking over
the country at that point, and he said I only want to talk about happy
things, and the president failed to prepare the nation for what would
happen because he only wanted to talk about happy things. There's a real
risk to the White House when they stiff arm the press like this. I get
message control, but this is starting to hurt Joe Biden.

HANNITY: You know, by the way, Governor, congratulations on your fifth
anniversary. I took quite we all took note of it. Congratulations, well-
deserved.

He doesn't want to answer questions. Nobody asks him -- he hasn't --
it's 40, what, two days of Americans behind enemy lines, doesn't even
talk about it. There's no plan to get them out. He's turned the page --
you know, he's a -- you know, nobody says a word really about what he
calls that the border. He seems to get away with it and they seem to
accept it. That's the strangest part to me.

FLEISCHER: Yeah.

MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It is the strangest part. And the
fact is that Joe Biden not only wants to control who gets to ask the
question, but according to Jen Psaki, he wants to control the questions
they even get to ask. And if it's not on the point that he wants to
make, which means the one he's scripted for, then he wants to be a
no-show.

Sean, vampires see more daylight and sunshine than Joe Biden does when
he walks out in front of the press. I've never seen anything like this,
and the worst part is the press seems to play along. And I don't know if
they've ever get fed up with it.

Contrast this with Donald Trump who would stand out there at the
helicopter until they had to refuel the darn thing because he just kept
taking questions.

HANNITY: That's true.

HUCKABEE: The press room ran out of donuts and then they finally all
walked off.

HANNITY: Listen to the chagrin of his staff, I can tell you that.

Isn't the reality though, Ari, if we're going to be honest and blunt and
now it's showing up in polls, Joe Biden is not up to this job.

FLEISCHER: Yeah.

HANNITY: He's weak, and he's a frail, cognitive mess. And they are
controlling him, and I don't even think he's making the all the
decisions either. That's not a -- that's not a reality that is fully
sunk into the country yet, but it's sinking in.

FLEISCHER: Sean, this is the problem with press control, the White House
trying to manipulate the press, as all White Houses do, can actually
backfire, because the fundamental question now, is Joe Biden capable of
standing up there and really taking it? Can he only do three or four
things?

HANNITY: What's the answer to that? What do you think? Is he?

(CROSSTALK)

FLEISCHER: There's something wrong with Joe Biden, that he can't do it.
And the staff is overtly shielding him from it. This is the problem they
are increasingly facing, whether it's his judgment, his age, his
potential infirmity or just the thing that has clouded him for 40 years,
bad decision making.

It's all adding up to a very unpopular president in every single poll
out there now.

HANNITY: Is he up to the job? Thirty seconds, Governor Huckabee?

HUCKABEE: I think we are looking at a remake of the old Charlton Heston
movie "El Cid". They prop him up on the horse and rode him to keep the
spirits. But the truth is he expired some time ago. And this is the guy
who is not into horse is very much as we all know. The truth is, the
only time he has been on one was in front of Walmart when he put a
quarter in there last weekend in Delaware.

(CROSSTALK)

FLEISCHER: -- just like that too. He was the guy in "Star Trek."

HANNITY: Weekend at Bidens, I don't know. They are propping him up.

Thank you both.

More HANNITY right after this.

HANNITY: All right. Unfortunately for us, that's all the time we have
left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. You make this
show possible. And please set your DVR so you never miss an episode.

In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Why? Laura Ingraham is
standing by and she has an awesome show, as always.

Presentation

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT, HEAD OF IR, INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES
GROUP, S.A.: Okay. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our Ninth Annual
IAG Capital Markets Day. My name is Andrew Light. I look after Investor
Relations.

As we've done in the last few years, we have an app for the event, about
which we emailed, I think, most of you yesterday. In case you missed it
or you don't -- or you can't -- have trouble logging in, just e-mail
investor.relations@iair.com, and we'll make sure you get a link to the
app and a password. There's plenty of information about the day, about
the speakers and about the Board as well.

Before I start and hand over to our Chairman, just some health and
safety. On the app, there's a map of Waterside. On the screen here is a
more detailed map. The exits are over there, 3 doors to the left are the
main ones. So if there is an event, please go out there and we can
assemble in the carpark. One comment I'd ask on the doors, please. This
door on the left here, to my left, the furthest door, please do not use
it, except in an emergency. You're allowed to use it then. It just makes
a lot of noise and distracts the speakers.

Right. The agenda for today. After the Chairman's remarks, Willie Walsh,
our CEO, will present the strategic investment case, along with Alistair
Hartley, our Director of Strategy. So it's a slightly different format
from previous years. We're not plowing through the opcos, it's more
thematic based.

The second presentation, again by Willie, will be on sustainability,
which we take extremely seriously at IAG. And by the way, this is the
last event where you'll be getting books. Whether it's results or
Capital Markets Day, in the future, we'll be relying entirely on
electronic presentations.

That will be followed by our new CIO, John Gibbs, who joined in
September, giving a presentation on IAG Tech; in other words, IT and
digital. And he'll be followed by Drew Crawley, who I know many of you
have known from the past, CEO of Avios, who'll begin his presentation on
IAG Loyalty.

Before -- after the coffee break, our new CFO, Steve Gunning, formerly
CFO of British Airways, will give a presentation on the financial
investment case, including some new metrics and targets, which we put in
the RNS this morning. And then there'll be a short presentation from
Luis Gallego, CEO of Iberia, on our announcement on Monday regarding Air
Europa, and then we'll go to Q&A.

Before I go, I just ask -- there is feedback on the app. Please do fill
that in through the day. And you've obviously given us very good
feedback in the past.

I'll now hand over to Antonio VÃ¡zquez, our Chairman.

ANTONIO VÃ¡ZQUEZ ROMERO, INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN, INTERNATIONAL
CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES GROUP, S.A.: Good morning, everybody. I'm happy to
welcome you to the Capital Market Day of IAG. And I'm happy to be with
the 3 Nonexecutive Directors with us: our Senior Independent Director,
Alberto Terol; and Javier FerrÃ¡n; and Marc Bolland. And so we are happy
to be with the management here and sharing this important morning with
you.

We announced an interim dividend at 3Q '19 results last week of EUR
0.145, and -- which is exactly the same than a year ago despite a slight
fall in our net income due to the BA pilot strike and disruptions. This
demonstrated the confidence of the Board not only in the way in which
the company is doing but in the outcome of the company and the financial
strength of our company. Including this interim dividend that is payable
in early December, we will have returned EUR 1.31 billion in cash to our
shareholders along the year 2019. In total, we will have returned EUR 4
billion to the shareholders over the 5 years between 2015 and 2019.

Regarding the use of excess capital, the Board will routinely evaluate
shareholder return in the context of growth and M&A opportunities.

As far as our M&A is concerned, it has been a busy year. At the
beginning of the year, we did announce that we discontinued our interest
in Norwegian Air Shuttle because, at that point in time, we did consider
the transaction was too risky. And last Monday, we were happy to
announce our intention to acquire Air Europa, which is basically a local
operator in Spain and Latin America. And Luis Gallego, CEO of Iberia, is
going to talk about it afterward.

As far as the Board of Directors is concerned, this year, we -- in our
ongoing refreshment activity of the Board, we have appointed 3 new Board
member, 2 nonexecutive: Margaret Ewing, which is bringing to the Board a
very, very significant financial experience, having been partner and
Vice Chairman of Deloitte for a while and also transfer experience
because she has been the CFO of BAA, which was a former Heathrow
company.

And Javier FerrÃ¡n has incorporated as well to our Board. Javier is
bringing in a very good experience in consumer good customers and -- a
very, very long experience. And he's bringing as well a very solid
experience and background as our CEO and Chairman of big listed
entities. Javier is currently the Chairman of Diageo.

And last but not least, the incorporation to our Board of Steve Gunning
as an Executive Director, replacing Enrique as the CFO of the company.
Most of you know Steve, and after today, everybody will know Steve very
well. So -- and I hope we will remember Steve quite properly.

On Brexit, we have submitted that -- we did inform that we have
submitted remedial plans to our national airline regulators in Spain, in
England, in Dublin, in Ireland and in Austria, and -- which basically
are dealing with the requirement of having contingency plans well
prepared in the -- for the post-Brexit situation. And the assessment has
been positive in the way that they all say that if we put in place the
plans that we have presented, we will comply with the EU ownership and
control requirement post Brexit.

As far as the permitted maximum is concerned, we put it in place and we
implemented it in the month of February. I realize and we realize, the
management and the Board and everybody, that it's not an ideal
situation, and we continue to evaluate the way to address it. The only
thing I can assure right now is that the Board and the management is
absolutely committed to removing the permitted maximum at the
appropriate time.

I hope you will enjoy today's presentation and -- from the IAG
leadership team. And I think you will conclude at the end of this
presentation that IAG is a unique compelling investment case.

So I give the floor to Willie. Thank you for coming.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH, CEO & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL
CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES GROUP, S.A.: Thank you. Thank you, Antonio, and
good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Welcome back to those
of you who've been with us here before.

As Andrew said, the agenda today has been driven by the feedback that
you have given us. The format is also as a result of the feedback that
you've given us. Now we recognize that not all of the issues that you've
asked us to deal with can be dealt with in terms of the formal
presentations, but we will have an opportunity at the end with plenty of
time for you to ask questions on any of the issues that are covered or
issues that may not have been covered that you would like us to address.

Now before I hand over to Alistair, I just want to remind you a little
bit about what it is IAG has done, what we're doing today. And then
Alistair and the rest of the presentations will take you through what it
is we're going to do going forward.

We've talked for some time about the unique structure that we have
within IAG, which enables us to focus on key areas to ensure that we are
the most efficient airline group in the business. We've got the right
people in the right places with the right portfolio of brands operating
in the right demand segments, and we're able to ensure that we cover all
of the opportunities that are available to us in the market. And through
this structure, we've been able to develop sustainable returns to drive
transformation where transformation has been required and to ensure that
we reward and remunerate our shareholders. And we intend to continue to
do that going forwards.

Now you can see that, that transformation has led us to deliver
operating margins that are well in excess of what people believed was
possible for especially legacy airlines in this industry. And we believe
that those margins are sustainable, and Steve will take you through the
plans for the next few years, which will demonstrate that these margins
will once again be achieved by the business.

We're also delivering industry-leading returns on invested capital. And
as you know, this has been a real focus area of IAG. We believe that
this is something that the industry has started to focus on. I often
pointed to the change that I can date back to 2008, where you see more
and more industry leaders focused on this issue and more and more
industry leaders talking about the need to deliver real returns on
invested capital. And this is one of the real strengths of IAG in that
we can ensure that the capital that we assign to the operating companies
within the business is done in the most efficient way, it drives healthy
competition between the airlines in the group and it ensures that all of
our airlines are focused on sustainable investment that will generate
returns in excess of our cost of capital. And we've given you details
there to enable you to compare our performance to other airlines using
the methodology that IAG has adopted for the calculation of return on
invested capital.

And we're doing this in very competitive hubs. You look at the position
that we have in our hubs relative to some of our major competitors. And
it's important to point out -- if you take Madrid for example, although
we have 49%, about 2/3 of the capacity of the Madrid airport is not used
today, so there's plenty of scope for growth in that hub airport. So
even in an airport where there are effectively no barriers to entry, we
are performing very strongly, and we believe that our model will enable
us continue to do that going forwards.

Now I've talked about the unique structure. And you've seen this chart
many times before, the corporate parents with the airline operating
companies divided between the various segments that you can see there.
We've given you an idea as to where we believe Air Europa will fit as a
value carrier within the group. And Luis will talk to you about his
ambition for the acquisition of Air Europa later on today.

Now what do we do? Well, we divide activities. One of the real
advantages, and you probably heard me say this before, is that because
we at IAG at the center are not distracted by the daily, daily
operational issues that all of our airlines face, we have time to think
long term. We have time to think strategically about where the industry
is going. So we set a long-term vision for the group. We ensure that the
portfolio is defined and that it's attractive and that capital
allocation is done on an efficient basis.

And I like this. We exert vertical and horizontal influence. Now that
can be pushing and pulling, kicking and thumping, but generally, it's
done in a collaborative way to ensure that all of the operating
companies are performing at their best. And where we don't see the
performance meeting the standards that we would expect, we intervene.

So we're not passive, and that's an important point. We're not a holding
company that passively watches and accepts the performance. We're daily
-- on a daily basis interacting with the operating companies where we
believe it's necessary to do so. And they have all the time then to
focus on a deep understanding of what their customers want and a deep
understanding of what the competitors are doing in their segment of the
market. They define the customer proposition for that targeted segment
group. They have stand-alone P&L responsibility, and that clearly has
discipline associated with it. And then I think the really unique sense
of IAG is that we can enable these operating companies to retain their
individual identity and their culture, which we believe is very
powerful. So where we see value in the brand, we can retain that brand,
retain the culture associated with that brand, retain the culture
associated with the people who support that brand, and that's what makes
us unique relative to other groups.

I say we're unique, but we recognize that there are some out there who
want to copy us. Michael has made no secret of the fact that he believes
our structure represents an opportunity. I think they will get there
eventually. The difference is, however, Michael, I think, will struggle
to take his hands off what Ryanair does and will therefore be involved.
I know from personal experience, when I transitioned from being the COO
to the CEO at Aer Lingus, I had to stop dealing with the day-to-day
operational initiatives that I had been dealing with. I know how
difficult that transition is. I know the transition between maybe being
the BA CEO to the IAG CEO was difficult. So I've gone through these
transitions, and I know how tough it is to let go of the
responsibilities that you've had and hand them over to somebody else and
trust in that person. I think Michael will struggle a little bit with
that, but they may well get there.

Lufthansa. Lufthansa has said the same thing. And to be fair to Carsten,
Carsten has been quite open about this. He loves running Lufthansa, the
airline, and that permeates throughout the whole Lufthansa group. And
that's what separates the way we operate from the way they operate.

So we do have a unique structure. I think in time, people may well try
to copy us. I think it will take time to do so because we're well ahead
of them in having gone through those transitions.

I'm -- we're not static. We recognize that some of the things we did
when we created IAG have worked extremely well, but we also believe that
there's value to be generated by changing some of the things. Now this
says what we're going to do tomorrow. Tomorrow doesn't mean tomorrow
obviously. It means in the future.

But just to give you an example, if I take loyalty, and you'll see a
presentation from Drew, you can see today that it's pretty much a
distinct opco focus. The loyalty of the BA Exec Club is very much driven
by BA. Now we believe there's real value to do that at a group level, to
exploit all of the data that we have across the group in a way that we
can't do on an individual opco basis. And Drew will demonstrate the
importance of IAG Loyalty and how that can be used to generate even
further cash flow and profit for the business.

In terms of talent, we spend a lot of time at IAG -- and again, one of
the advantages that we have is that we have time to assess the talent
within the business. We spend quite a bit of time as a management
committee going through the senior people within the business,
understanding their performance, understanding how we can help them to
improve and understanding how well we're prepared for future succession
planning within the business. And we believe there's scope for us to do
even more of that centrally. So we're looking at improving and enhancing
the activity that we do at the group. So there's a lot of things that
we're doing today that we do well but can be improved upon, and that
clearly will enable us to lock -- unlock future value for the business.

And finally, my team. Now I think somebody was having a joke when they
said refreshed because if you look at the photographs there, I think the
only person that looks refreshed is Lynne and she had just come back
from a week's holiday. But these photographs were taken during one of
our management committee meetings. And I think as we went through the
day, you can see how refreshed people actually were.

But what is important is that of the 12 people there, only 3 of us were
here at the beginning. That's myself; Chris Haynes, the General Counsel;
and Julia Simpson, the Chief of Staff. Luis is the second CEO at Iberia.
Javier the second CEO at Vueling. Steve was the CEO at IAG Cargo before
moving to BA CFO and now becoming the Group CFO. So we've had a lot of
change. Lynne, in fact, is the third cargo CEO we've had since we
started. Steve was number one, then followed by Drew and now by Lynne.

So we've had good rotation within the team. A lot of talent has come
from within the organization. And indeed, we've brought talent from
outside. We've got John who you'll see later on today and Alistair who's
going to follow me. So we've got great talent within this business.
We've got great opportunity to exploit that talent. And where we see the
need to bring talent in from outside, we're not going to be afraid to do
that.

So we've got the right people running the right businesses with the
right brands, delivering the right customer proposition in the right
demand segments, and it's supported by efficient, innovative and
professional support services with aligned businesses there to exploit
additional value from the activities of the operating companies. Very
well positioned today, and going forwards, we will be even better
positioned.

I'll hand over now to Alistair.

ALISTAIR HARTLEY;DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY: Thanks, Willie. Good morning,
everyone. As Willie mentioned, I'm going to now build on what we've
talked about in the unique structure, and I'm going to take you through
the strategic investment case for IAG. And that's built around 3 of our
strategic priorities: firstly, a portfolio of world-class brands;
secondly, growing leadership positions; and thirdly, leveraging our
platform to create cost innovation and efficiency.

So kicking that off, a portfolio of world-class brands. At the heart of
the strategic investment case for IAG is understanding that we have
customers at the center -- at the forefront and the center of everything
we are doing. As Willie mentioned before, we have a really deep and
real-time understanding across the entire group of our customers' needs.
And when we understand that customers can travel for very different
reasons and they can be in different places and different demand
segments, we understand that those needs can be very different in those
situations. And we have a portfolio of brands that allow us to
specifically focus on delivering those needs, really focusing in on what
the customer wants and what the customer needs against each of those
different demand segments. We recognize that customers move between
these but we believe, and we believe it's demonstrated in our results
and will be continued to demonstrate as we go forward, that having
brands focused on specific areas allows us to better address those needs
rather than diluting that and trying to be everything to everyone.

We recognize that we need to be leaders in this space. And at the
moment, there is some additional work that we need to do to get there.
As we think about these demand spaces, across the horizontal axis here,
and where we are positioned currently and where our aspirations are, we
recognize we are on a journey. But leadership is incredibly important
with this portfolio of brands that we have, the current portfolio and
potentially adding to that portfolio with additional brands as we move
forward.

So there's work to do, but we're really encouraged because what we've
seen in the last couple of years and what we believe our plans are going
to demonstrate -- to deliver as we move forward is an ability to improve
the Net Promoter Score. So this is the customers' view of believing in
and recommending IAG carriers, and this is aggregated at an IAG level.
Back in 2017 from 17 to 2019, 24, so seeing continuous improvements over
the last couple of years. And we're forecasting again that as we move
forward, we will continue to deliver improvements in each of these
areas. So that's really critical, having customer at the center of what
we do and that we drive these continuous improvements in Net Promoter
Scores across our airlines.

It's not just aggregated in that one Net Promoter Score. Actually, we're
really encouraged because when you look across each of the elements of
the customer journey, and this is again aggregated at an IAG level, when
you look across each of those elements, we're seeing satisfaction
improve in every one of those elements. This is basically a measure --
just so you're clear, it's the top 3 scores in customer satisfaction on
a score to 10, the percentage of customers that are scoring that in the
top 3 categories. And so we're seeing increases in customer satisfaction
in every one of these areas, and we believe there's lots more to come.

To dive a bit deeper into focusing on one brand, particularly BA. Again,
looking at GBP 6.5 billion of investment in customer satisfaction. We
started that spend and we're continuing to spend that over the course of
the business plan over the next 3 to 5 years. And this is really
important. Again, here, we've illustrated exactly where we have gone and
started some of these transformations, where we've started to invest
this money, in lounges, in aircraft refurbishment and catering and soft
product. And again, we can show demonstrated results from that
investment.

So we are really focused on making sure we understand what the customers
want and what they need and that we're taking actions specifically in
those areas to address those concerns so that we can be their airlines
of choice as IAG.

Particularly for BA, that is resulting in improved NPS in both cabins
and in both long haul and in short haul. So on this chart, what I'm
showing you across the top is short haul non-premium and short haul
premium and on the bottom, long haul non-premium and long-haul premium.
In every one of those cabins, if you want to call it that way, and on
both short haul and on long haul, we are seeing NPS improvements. So we
are really, really encouraged the actions that we have been taking and
that we're planning to continue will continue to deliver this improved
customer satisfaction, continuing to strengthen our brands and enable us
to have that really world-class leading performance of brands in our
portfolio.

I think I'll highlight again here on the bottom -- in the bottom right,
long haul premium is the smallest improvement that we've seen to date.
But again, we're encouraged because of what we've got coming. And in
this case, what we're seeing with the new aircraft and the new seats
that we're bringing in this premium cabin, we're seeing really
encouraging early signs from this. So we believe that, although that's
only a 2-point improvement that we're seeing in the long haul premium
cabin over the last couple of years, that there's a lot more to come
from this space. And the early signs from the reviews that we're seeing
and our customers' feedback is that really, we are going to be able to
drive these improvements in this space as well.

The second strategic priority that IAG has is growing our leadership
positions. And what's really, really encouraging is that we're at a
start point. I say start point, 10 years effectively into IAG, is that
in 8 of our home cities, we have great leadership positions in each of
these home markets. The left-hand side is our view of leadership
positions by revenue, and the right-hand side is looking at it by
passengers. But in each of these cities, London, Madrid, Barcelona and
Dublin, you can see that IAG has established strength in these
leadership positions.

Our choice of business model generating the revenue is allowing us to
maintain those leadership positions. Our focus on customers in the
demand spaces that we're looking at is allowing us to continue to do
that. And we think and we believe that as we go forward, we can continue
to strengthen these positions. We may be able to potentially add new
home cities or new home markets through inorganic activities, but
particularly in the markets that we're already in, we believe there's an
opportunity to strengthen our leadership positions. And that's an
incredibly important part, that leadership element of IAG's strategy.

If we focus in a little bit on Europe for the moment and looking at the
European market, actually over the last circa decade, back to 2008, we
have seen considerable consolidation in this market. So it's about a
20-point increase in what the top 5 airline groups accounted for since
2008, and IAG has played a really major role in driving some of that
consolidation. But what we believe is that it's not done yet. We believe
there's still a significant amount more that needs to occur in this
space, and IAG plans to be part of that consolidation activity.

We believe that actually what we're seeing in the industry, particularly
around credit cards, is going to drive some of that consolidation. So
what we're seeing here is the credit cards, as airlines become -- get
into positions of more distress, they're tightening those strings.
They're restricting the access to that forward revenue. And there's a
couple of examples here on the screen that you can see of where that has
come out and where it's been public. We think this has a really, really
significant impact on working capital, and we estimate, for a long-haul
carrier, the forward revenue for a widebody aircraft can be up to EUR 10
million on credit cards alone. So this is cash that airlines need that
is being restricted.

So as we see this dynamic shifting in the industry, we're seeing
actually it's probably going to generate more and more opportunities to
consolidation. Or it's going to see -- and I think it's a major
contributing factor in where you've seen Norwegian coming out and go and
ask its shareholders for more capital, yes? And they can only do that so
many times. But this is a key changing dynamic in the industry that we
believe will continue to support the ability for further consolidation
in this space.

Not only are we seeing the credit cards and a changing dynamic in that
space, but we're seeing the ability for start-ups and the trend of
start-ups and failures start to change. If you look back to 2000, we've
now listed the number of start-up airlines in the European context, and
you can see actually a pretty dramatic shift in the shrinking number of
start-ups you're seeing each year come into this space. Also, if you
look across this, and we've provided the analysis, around 70% of those
start-ups fail. So this is complex, it's hard, and we're seeing an
increased rate of failures in this industry.

But it's not only start-ups that are failing. And actually, if you look
at a recent set of failures in this space, you've got both well,
old-established legacy airlines as well as more recent start-ups
struggling to survive in this space. We believe that with our portfolio
of brands and our strength as IAG, we can continue to play a key role in
consolidating, particularly in Europe and potentially further afield.
But having these leadership positions that we have in the markets
provides us some resilience and positions us well for further
consolidation as we move forward.

The final strategic priority that I wanted to touch on that supports the
IAG strategic investment case is around cost and efficiency in our
platform. And as we look at IAG's performance in this space over the
last, call it, 10 years, we believe we've shown and demonstrated that we
are driving the industry in cost efficiency. The graphs on the chart in
front of you show our cost -- our nonfuel unit cost performance indexed
back to 2010, and we've shown it against a number of European and North
American peers on this chart. What we can demonstrate here really,
really clearly is approximately 11% of cost driven out since 2010, since
the formation of IAG on an indexed basis and looking at that on a
nonfuel cost -- unit cost basis. So we believe we've shown that.

And I'd like to pick out a couple of points that in particular for IAG
have enabled us to do that. So not only are we developing our portfolio
of airlines and by bringing leadership airlines in there, we are driving
synergies at a cost level each time that we bring new airlines into our
portfolio of IAG. In addition to that portfolio, we have a platform of
services. So we get synergies when we bring them together, but tapping
them into the platform -- the common platform that IAG has enables
further cost improvements.

And fundamentally and a point which Willie hit upon, we also enable each
of the individual opcos to transform when necessary. And Iberia is a
classic example of this through Plan de Futuro and its Plan de Futuro
II, where it has shown that it can independently go and transform cost
issues that it has within its business or that any of our other opcos
have within their businesses to get to the level of performance that we
need to have. And we believe at a group level and at individual opcos,
this cost efficiency that we have shown and this discipline at
structurally changing our cost basis really positions us well against
our peer sets to be able to weather any particular cycle that the
industry faces. Now we've been on a long run of an up cycle, but we
believe this cost discipline is one of the things that stands IAG out at
being able to be resilient in any downturns that may come in the future.

There are other things in this cost performance like density, like other
bits that impact how this happens. And so the combination of business
models flow through into all of these factors. But when you actually,
though, break that down and try and equalize it, again, we see each of
our individual opcos, on an equivalent seat basis, having an incredibly
competitive cost position versus their peer sets. So what we've
delivered now, and this is all real reported data that we have gone back
and calculated per equivalent seat kilometer as opposed to available
seat kilometer, is that each of our opcos are strongly positioned
against their peer sets and are able to then go and execute their
business model to generate the revenue leadership that we spoke about
before.

In addition to this cost, we are incredibly focused on innovation and
digital. In 2019, Frost & Sullivan had run a report towards the tail end
of 2018 and into 2019, 66 airlines -- airline groups participating. IAG
came out ranked #1 in this report. And here on the screen, we've shown a
subset of the airlines that participated in this report. It's an
external validation of what we at our core believe we are driving for
the industry, innovation and digital transformation.

We've spoken to you a number of times around the 5 key transformations
that IAG is focused on: shop order -- used to be called Shop Order Pay,
now called Shop Order Settle; data; marketplaces; automation; and
digital mindset. And across each of those, we continue to be really,
really encouraged by the early wins and the early value that we are
generating. So across all of these spaces, we are seeing these -- not
just proof-of-concepts, we're seeing these actually starting to be
implemented and generating real value for our shareholders and for each
of our businesses.

I'm going to focus in a little bit on the Shop Order Settle and NDC to
wrap this up on this last element of our sort of strategic priorities.
NDC, we are incredibly strong supporters. We're on the leadership -- the
IATA leadership airline group. And what I'm really, really proud and
happy to say is that in fourth quarter of this year, we will be
certified at the highest level from IATA of NDC readiness, so certified
for NDC at scale. We're going to be able to deal with complex bookings
and interactions through NDC, and we're going to be able to deal with
them at volume. So that certification is coming, and IAG through British
Airways and Iberia is going to be at the forefront of driving NDC
adoption.

Over the last 12 months, we've seen and continue to be really encouraged
by the adoption rate improvements of NDC in each of British Airways and
Iberia. In British Airways, we've seen a 3x increase in adoption of NDC
bookings over the last 12 months. In Iberia, it's 7x. And we've already
gone out there and been clear that we are going to continue to drive
this. And one of the things that we're going to do to support that is
development of unique content via these digital channels and through
NDC.

In fourth quarter this year, we are going to be introducing more price
points on our long haul. That is also going to include the North
Atlantic, so 3 more price points being introduced in there through these
channels only. We're also bringing in exclusive handbag-only fares. And
we see this as being one of the key elements differentiating the content
through these channels that is going to continue to drive the adoption
in this space. So we see this as exciting. We see ourselves as being
ready to move forward here, and we're excited about the improvements
that we're going to see over the coming years.

We believe this puts us on a fast track to a low-cost and efficient
digital distribution, and that's really, really critical as we move
forward into the next business cycle. Our objectives in this space are
threefold, and they're really, really clear. We want to drive increased
revenue through enhanced retailing capability. Owning that content and
being able to use that through the NDC channels and digital channels
will allow us to drive those revenue improvements.

Critically, again as I said, having customer at the core of what we do,
we need to be able to improve the customer experience. And through these
digital channels like NDC, we're going to be able to deal with
disruption and better meet the customer needs. And then finally, and
again, wrapped in with this cost efficiency element, we see NDC as being
a key, key, key lever at helping drive efficiency and lower costs
through our distribution channels.

Bringing that together again and before I hand over to Willie to talk
that sustainability, we see it as a really, really compelling strategic
investment case for IAG. Across those -- we're building on our unique
structure and across our 3 strategic priorities around portfolio of
world-class brands, strong leaderships and growing leadership positions
and the cost and efficiency and innovation, we believe we've got an
incredible base to build from. And we're excited and we hope you're
excited about the opportunities that go forward to create value for our
shareholders.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: So sustainability, I think one of the biggest
challenges we face in the industry today, a challenge actually faced by
all industries, particularly industries that are carbon-intensive but
probably even more so for aviation because, in the short to medium term,
we don't see an alternative to fossil-based fuels. And that's why it's
important for us.

For every tonne of kerosene we use, we generate 3.15 tonnes of CO2. And
until we can see a sustainable alternative to that, it's clear that our
gross emissions will grow as gross emissions of CO2 in other industries
decline, and therefore, the percentage of CO2 that the industry is
responsible for will increase. And in an environment where people are
focused more and more on the impacts of climate change, that clearly is
an area that we have to address. So individually and collectively at
IAG, we're absolutely committed to sustainability.

Now our primary focus will be on the impact that our industry has on
climate change, but obviously, there are other areas like noise, waste
management, supply chain that we will focus on. So it's not just about
climate change but climate change is clearly one of the major issues
that people are focused on today. And we've got a great track record.
And often, this surprises people, but BA has been one of the leaders in
relation to environmental targeting and efficiency for many, many years.
In fact when I joined BA in 2005, we were already participating
voluntarily in the U.K. emissions trading scheme. And BA had to argue
with the government to be allowed to be included in that.

And if you remember, the Kyoto Protocol excluded international aviation,
but actually it allowed for domestic aviation to be included. So on that
basis, BA argued that they should be allowed to participate. And the
reason they wanted to participate is they wanted to get experience of
operating with an emissions trading scheme. And that has been very
powerful in enabling us to convince others that this is the right way
forwards. And we have been at the forefront of the industry's drive to
improve the environmental performance, and we are committed to
continuing to take a leadership role in relation to that.

So what are we doing? Well, we're embedding sustainability into the
operating companies' business plans, into the IAG activities. And that
may -- that might sound a bit odd because, as I said earlier, we've been
doing this for some time. But I think the reality of it is our focus on
sustainability and the environment, while real and important, almost sat
outside of the day-to-day commercial activities of the airline. And what
we see today is that there's often a clear conflict between some of the
things we do that make commercial and financial sense and the things we
should be doing from an environmental point of view. So more and more,
we want to ensure that we test everything we do financially, that it's
sustainable against environmental sustainability. And this is causing us
actually to challenge some of the traditional things that we've done.

There's a great example of this. Earlier this year, I think June, July
of this year, Eurocontrol produced a paper. It's called -- this is from
the Aviation Intelligence Unit, think paper, and you can get it online.
And the subject was Fuel Tankering: economic benefits and environmental
impacts. And I'll just read you some of the conclusions because I think
it highlights one of the challenges we face as an industry.

As aviation is a highly competitive market, airlines must do everything
possible to minimize their operating costs. In particular, tools have
been developed for identifying the value of performing fuel tankering, a
practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its
flights in order to save costs. However, fuel tankering is not without
environmental consequences as the more fuel the aircraft carries, the
more fuel it burns and the more CO2 it emits. Based on the elements of
information available to this study, it was estimated that fuel
tankering could result in a net saving of EUR 265 million per year for
the airlines. However, it would generate 286,000 additional tonnes of
fuel burnt and 901,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions at an ECAC level per year
within Europe. This represents a substantial economic benefit and a
significant environmental impact.

And this is a classic dilemma that we face. For many years driven by
ensuring financial performance, we've done things that may not be
sustainable on an environmental front. Now I understand -- actually,
Panorama are going to do a program at some stage, which I'm sure will be
fascinating and grave since will have darkened rooms and actors
speaking. But the reality of it is, this has -- this in the public
domain. It's not a secret. Now of that 900,000 extra tonnes of CO2, we
generate about 18,000 tonnes of that, about 2%.

So we undertake tankering. Now we undertake tankering for a number of
reasons. In some cases, we do it for operational reasons, where fuel
uplift at some of the airports we go to is sporadic and therefore, we
have to ensure that we have sufficient fuel for the return journey. We
do it, in some cases, for operational reasons to enable the turnaround
of the aircraft in line with the time that's available. And in many
cases, we do it for cost because the cost differential between airports
can be very significant. The cost differential, according to this study,
between the price of fuel at Heathrow and the price of fuel in Glasgow,
it's 25% more expensive at Glasgow.

So we have done and we continue to do tankering today.

We're challenging that. We're asking ourselves whether this is
sustainable and whether we should be pricing in the environmental impact
of that. So some of the things that made absolute sense for us in the
past may not, on environmental grounds, make sense. Indeed, some of the
routes that we fly today make commercial sense but may not make
environmental sense. And this is going to be more of a challenge, so
therefore, we've got to embed these issues into the way we think about
doing our business.

And you can see what we're doing. We are looking at incentives,
incentivizing management to ensure that we're not incentivizing the
wrong behavior. Because, clearly, the financial saving would have
incentivized us to do fuel tankering, but maybe that's the wrong thing
to do and the wrong issue to incentivize. So we want to make sure that
we have our incentives aligned to the right activities to ensure
financial sustainability but also to ensure environmental
sustainability. We're going to be completely open about what it is we do
more and more. We want to disclose more of our activities. And more of
it -- we'll ensure that this is measured and audited by leaders in the
industry and at a Board level, we have the appropriate governance.

So the Board is fully engaged in relation to this. The Board is
absolutely aligned to the thinking of the management committee and the
management committee aligned to what the Board wants us to do in
relation to this area. So we'll embed it in the business. We'll measure
it. We'll monitor it. We'll audit it and we'll ensure at all stages that
we have the right governance to ensure that we are doing the right
things.

So why is this important? I do not dispute the scientific evidence that
CO2 is causing climate change. It's leading to warming, and warming is
leading to more extreme activities as it comes to climate. The Paris
Accord, as you know, set out an objective to limit warming below 2%
(sic) [2 degrees]. But it also had an aspiration to limit it to 1.5
degrees -- sorry, not percent, 1.5 degrees. And more and more in recent
years, people have begun to say that, that has now not got to be an
aspiration, that's got to be the goal. That's got to be what it is we
do.

And as a result, we're seeing countries adopt net 0 by 2050, and we
believe that, that is appropriate. So we don't dispute the science. We
think the science in this area is absolutely clear. Some of the science
in relation to the additional impact of aviation is still immature, and
further study needs to be done in relation to that. But when it comes to
CO2, I think it's absolutely clear.

Now why is this important from an aviation point of view? Well, you
might think actually it's not a big deal because if you look at the
distribution of manmade CO2 by various segments, transport is
responsible for 22%. And within that, aviation is responsible for 11%,
road transport is 74%. So when you look at aviation in a global context,
we're just over 2%. So for many years, the industry said, "Don't worry
about us. We're only a tiny proportion of this. We're only 2% so focus
on other areas." And within that 2%, you can see actually that 60% of it
is generated through international activities and 40% domestic. And of
that 40%, 3/4 of that is by 5 countries: U.S., China, India, Russia and
Brazil. Those 5 countries account for 3/4 of the domestic CO2 generated.
U.S. alone is 17% -- over 17% of CO2 produced by the aviation industry
is produced in the U.S. domestic market.

Now this is one of the problems that we face with the international
accord that we have, CORSIA, because CORSIA only addresses the
international aviation. It excludes this domestic aviation. And quite
honestly, it was one of the reasons why the U.S. airline industry was
able to sign up to CORSIA because it excludes a lot of their activity.
And that's why I've been very clear publicly in saying that I think
CORSIA is a good first step, but it needs to be developed upon if the
industry is to demonstrate that it has the credentials to be allowed to
continue to grow into the future.

And this highlights part of the problem. So if you look in 2005, the
aviation industry generated about 640 tonnes -- million tonnes of CO2,
so it was 2.3% of total global CO2. In 2018, that was 918 million
tonnes. And you can see globally, we're seeing CO2 increase, but we're
still around 2%. 2.3%, 2.4%. The problem is when we forecast what would
happen in 2050, and this is just focused on CO2. As other industries
start to improve their performance and decarbonize, we still see our
growth increasing. And we would go from about 918 million tonnes in 2018
to 1.8 billion, possibly 1.9 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2050. And that's
why people are focused on us.

So the -- in percentage terms, you could argue we're not a big problem.
The problem is, in absolute terms, we're going to continue to grow as
most other industries can actually reduce. So as economic activity
continues to grow, a lot of industries have been able to disconnect
their growth from their CO2 performance. We still have a short- to
medium-term requirement for fossil fuels. Now there is a lot that will
happen between now and then, and I'll cover some of those now as we go
through the action plan.

So you can see at a global level, we've had the Kyoto Protocol. You've
had the U.K. Climate Change Act. You've seen the Paris Accord. So
globally, a lot of focus on this area. And what have we been doing -- or
what have we been faced? Well, we faced additional taxes, the
introduction of air passenger duty, which was introduced as an
environmental tax, expanded -- doubled in 2006 because of environmental
reasons, increased further until the government finally acknowledged --
because they couldn't continue to argue that they were doing this for
environmental reasons but it was introduced an environmental tax.

EU ETS was being introduced, it came into effect. In 2013 to 2020, the
current phase, we get about 34 million tonnes of allowances -- or 34
million allowances. It represents about 45% of the activity within the
intra-European area. So we're paying for about 55% of our emissions
today through the EU ETS scheme. In 2020, that will start reducing by
2.2% -- or from 2021, 2.2% per annum, the amount of free allowances we
get. So more and more of our activity intra-Europe is going to be
covered by the emissions trading scheme. But the emissions trading
scheme is only flights within the EU, originally designed to deal with
flights into and out of the EU, including international traffic. But
because of opposition by other global economies to what the EU was
doing, the EU decided to pause that while ICAO looked at introducing a
global scheme.

And in 2016, ICAO introduced what they call CORSIA, Carbon Offsetting
and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. So this is a scheme
that will apply from 2020 initially on a voluntary basis, but a lot of
countries have signed up. I think covering about 78% to 80% of
international global emissions.

So there is a lot of activity going on to ensure that this is efficient.

But at the same time, what we see is more and more countries looking at
taxation. Now in our opinion, and I'm happy to debate this with anybody,
taxation does nothing to improve environmental performance. And I think
there's lots of evidence to demonstrate that with what's happened with
road transport. We believe that the emissions trading scheme and carbon
offsetting scheme is the right way forward because the money that goes
into those schemes actually goes to improve environmental performance.

Taxation, the money that goes into the government coffers, not $0.01 of
that goes to improving environmental performance. Now we've argued for
these taxes to be hypothecated. There's no government that's willing to
do that. So if you're serious about improving the environmental
performance, then the emissions trading schemes and carbon offsetting
schemes are the right way to do it because the money goes directly to
improving the environmental performance of industries. More and more, as
I said, these taxes are beginning to appear, and we believe that this is
something that excites governments, so we have to demonstrate that we're
serious about doing this. And this was one of the reasons why we have
changed our approach to our commitments.

Now U.K. aviation signed up to a pathway that aligns to the global
aviation scheme. And you can see here -- an interest -- this is -- so
referenced to 2010, what's interesting about this is the 2005 figures
were actually higher than the 2010. In 2005, from memory, the U.K.
aviation was responsible for about 3 -- 37.5 million tonnes of CO2. That
fell in 2010 to 34 million. That was clearly as a result of the global
financial crisis, where international activity and, indeed, some
domestic aviation activity declined through that period.

But using 2010 as a reference, you can see what happens in U.K. aviation
if we do nothing. Just looking at the forecast demands, our emissions,
as an industry, in the U.K., would significantly increase, completely
unsustainable. Nobody is going to allow that to happen.

So what are we doing? Well, there is a lot going on. You can see, we're
reducing the amount of CO2 through more efficient operations, more
efficient ATC routings. And there's a lot of activity going in behind
that. We're improving as a result of aircraft that have come into
service, replacement aircraft that will come into service in the future,
the development of sustainable biofuels. And this is an area BA has been
very focused on. And when we look at sustainable biofuels, we're focused
on waste to liquid. And the reason for that is we haven't -- we can't
have a biofuel that's using lands that otherwise would have been used to
-- for the production of food. So to be truly sustainable, you have to
be clear in terms of the feedstock that you're using and to ensure that
you're not competing for other sources.

So sustainable biofuels will be part of the solution in the longer term,
but you can see the impact. It's not going to be enough to offset the
increase in CO2. So to achieve what was the global target of a 50%
reduction in net emissions, we have to have some form of a global
market-based measure. And what we're seeing here is that a continuation
of the EU ETS and CORSIA. Now originally, it was expected that once
CORSIA come into play in 2020, the EU ETS would be replaced. We don't
believe that, that will happen. And in fact, I think there's a strong
argument for the EU ETS scheme to continue beyond 2020 aligned with
CORSIA as well.

So the industry had said we can improve our performance through a number
of measures. We can pursue carbon-neutral growth from 2020 through
activities that we're taking -- we're undertaking internally, but also
because we recognize that we're going to have to pay our way and,
therefore, provide financial incentive to other industries to
decarbonize and that the net benefit of that for the world will be what
you see here in the dotted blue line.

Our plan is slightly different, and this is something that we've
developed recently. So you can see here, if we were to do nothing, our
gross emissions in 2020, which would be about -- our latest forecast, 31
million tonnes of CO2. In 2018, the most recent reported figures for IAG
was 29.9 million tonnes of CO2 gross, 27 million tonnes net, the
difference being the -- our participation in the EU ETS. But if we did
nothing, our gross emissions would continue to grow, and that's
unacceptable. That's unacceptable to us. The people working for us in
the business don't want to be associated with this. So this isn't just
about addressing concerns externally. This is about addressing concerns
internally as well. We want people to be proud to work for us as an
industry. We want them to be absolutely clear that we are committed to
playing our part.

Now if I look at our emissions, about 4% is from domestic activity, 20%
in Europe, 76% of it is from international activity. Interestingly, you
can see here that most of the industry's emissions, about 85% of the
industry's emissions are from flights in excess of 1,500 kilometers,
where there is no alternative. A lot of the debate today is about taking
an alternative to aviation. But in many cases, there is no alternative.
In our case, 78% of our emissions are from flights in excess of 1,500
kilometers. But it's important to point out. If you look at Iberia, for
example, the average stage length of the Iberia domestic network is
about 860 kilometers. But a flight from Madrid to Tenerife, which is
part of that, is about 1,800 kilometers. Now there isn't really an
alternative to get from Madrid to Tenerife or Madrid to Las Palmas other
than to fly. There is a ship. I'm not going to be taking it, but we've
got to be realistic here. Yes, there are so many activities we're
engaged in today where there is an alternative available and a more
sustainable form of transport available. And as I said at the beginning,
that's leading us to question some of the activities that we were doing.
But a lot of this is activity driven where there isn't an alternative --
sensible or sustainable alternative available.

So you can see the industry targets were to achieve a 50% reduction in
net emissions by 2050. Following discussions with the Board in recent
months, we've decided that it's time for us to demonstrate our
leadership again and to recognize that the debates that led to a target
of 50% reduction, which was back in 20 -- 2009, 2010 is no longer
relevant today, and that things have moved on. So we committed in the
last month to a target of net 0 emissions by 2050. Now that's a big
change. And we have a pathway to get there. Not all of it is completely
aligned because I think we're going to have to improve on some of these
targets. But we're looking at and achieving 1.7% efficiency on an annual
basis up to 2020. In 2020, our grams to CO2 per passenger kilometer,
which is the standard industry measure, we're targeting 87. In 2018, it
was 91.5. We're looking, by 2025, to have that at 80. In fact, I think
we can get it below 80 with some of the things we're looking at today.
So we'll be looking to improve that target, but these are the targets we
have today to achieve 22 million tonnes net emissions by 2030.
Realistically, I think we're going to have to target something in the
range of 17 million to 18 million to have us on a clear path to getting
to net 0 by 2050.

So we have a pathway. We know what it is we're going to do to achieve
the targets that we've set. And we're going to challenge ourselves to
improve on these targets and to accelerate the performance of the
business. And how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to do it
through a number of measures. New aircraft, 142 new aircraft by 2023. I
think the later chart, I know somebody's going to add this up. I think
we have 142, but it's close enough, 143. Now the A350, recently, we took
a group of journalists to demonstrate the new BA Club product, which you
can see outside the door, for those of you who haven't seen it, on a
flight Toronto. On the day of the flight, on the A350-1000s that we
operated that day, which is configured with 331 seats, which is, as you
know, a replacement aircraft for our Boeing 747-400s, which has up to
337 seats, so it's a like-for-like replacement. The difference in fuel
burn for the A350 compared to the 747, because I got our team to run 2
flight plans, same payload, same flight plan, same conditions, exactly
the same external factors. So the only difference here is the
performance of one aircraft against the other. The A350 was 38% more
efficient. It burnt 38% less fuel and, therefore, generated 38% less
CO2, like-for-like. That's a huge improvement.

So we're investing in new aircraft, and these new aircraft have
significant fuel and environmental benefits over the aircraft that
they're replacing. As you know, some people argue that we should have
accelerated the replacement of the 747s a number of years ago, and we
did look at that. Part of the problem was we didn't have an aircraft
available to us that was a like-for-like replacement. So we have
replaced some of them with the 777-300ER, a fantastic aircraft. But in
our configuration, like-for-like, we have about 293 seats. That would
give us a saving of about 24%, so it is significant. But we took a
decision then not to invest all of our effort and money and capital into
a very good aircraft when there was an even better aircraft coming
along. And I think absolutely the right decision because to achieve the
targets that we believe are important, getting the benefits from new
aircraft like the A350-1000s and the Boeing 777, that we'll take later
on. These are significantly better than the aircraft that they would
replace. So that's going to be part of the solution. We're investing in
fuel efficiency software. So all the time looking to improve the
operational performance.

We're looking at innovation, and you'll see outside some of the --
there's a couple of stands there with activities that we're investing
in, including carbon capture with Mosaic. I think a fascinating
opportunity for us. So we're looking at biofuels, sustainable biofuels.
We're looking at carbon capture. We will see the production of biofuels
from 2024, 40 million liters a year, very excited about that. Waste to
liquid, it represents about a 70% reduction in CO2 over the life cycle
of that. We factor in everything. We factor in the CO2 that's generated
by taking the feedstock to the plant, the CO2 that will be generated in
the plant. So it's looking at every aspect of the production of this to
compare CO2 from a tonne of kerosene today to CO2 from a tonne of this
biofuel in the future, about a 70% reduction. That's really exciting.
And that can be scaled up, but there is a limit to how much that can do
in the time frame that we're talking about.

And then as we've said, there has to be some form of financial
incentive, or in our case, of financial cost because we're going to have
to invest, and we're going to have to spend money to improve our
performance. But equally, we're going to have to give money through
these schemes to incentivize other industries that do have more readily
available alternative sources of energy.

So you can see the pathway that we've identified to get us to a net 0.
39% of this will come through, if you like, the existing technology with
aircraft changes. 18% by 2050, we believe, will come from the
sustainable biofuels that we're investing in and the balance, 43%, will
come through efficient offsetting and emissions trading schemes, which
will include voluntary offset and carbon capture technology.

So as I said, we have a credible pathway to get there. We recognize that
we're going to have to spend money. We recognize that this is money that
the industry -- and costs that the industry is going to face. We look at
it as a blended cost of fuel going forwards. So therefore, the more we
can do to reduce our fuel burn, the more we can do to become more
efficient, the better it's going to be financially and environmentally.

And as we said at the beginning, this event is being completely offset,
40 tonnes of carbon offset. We looked at how everybody was getting here,
the mode of transport being used. CO2 being produced by everything to
see how much CO2 that this event was likely to produce. So you can see
where I'm going. This is probably going to be the last Capital Markets
Day. I talked about that the last time.

But -- so we have offset all of this, and we've done it through
Ecosphere, who are here today as well. And what you're going to see then
going forwards is we're going to continue to lead the industry. We were
instrumental in the industry, agreeing to the 50% net reduction by 2050.
I led the debate within IATA. We've got the rest of the industry to sign
up to that. We're the first to invest in what we believe is a truly
sustainable biofuel, waste to liquids. And we're the first airline group
in the world to commit to net 0 by 2050.

And in future, that important chart that you saw at the beginning, which
sets out the investment case, you're going to see -- it's going to be
underpinned by environmental sustainability. So it's not just that we're
focused on our financial performance and doing everything that is right
to make sure that we have a financially sustainable business. We're
going to do everything and integrate all of our thinking, all of our
planning, all of our activity to ensure that all of this is underpinned
by an environmentally sustainable business in the future. Thank you.

JOHN GIBBS, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED
AIRLINES GROUP, S.A.: Okay. Thank you, Willie. So I'm not quite sure how
to follow that, really. So my name is John Gibbs. I'm the new CIO. I'm
going to spend the next 30 minutes talking about digital and IT. First
part, I'm going to just talk about is some reflection along since I've
joined. Second one is about the creation of IAGTech, which Willie has
already highlighted as one of the platforms of IAG. And we'll talk a
little bit about technology.

So I think, really, I'm going to start off by just talking a little bit
about before I joined. And I think we recognize we've had stability
issues, some cybersecurity challenges. We took immediate actions. And I
think, actually, if you look at some of the actions we've taken, that
presents a really good foundation for the business. For example, UPS and
the diesel generators in our existing data centers.

I think also, we continue to focus on stability and cyber, and some of
those produced real foundations for us going forward. For example, we
are creating new data centers, data and the migration projects. And
actually, we're investing in cloud-based services.

So as I look forward, I think, actually, we've got a good foundation,
which includes, of course, cybersecurity investments. And also, we've
been doing things around the operational stability. For example, we've
actually been doing things like replacing legacy infrastructure,
evergreening, patch updates, et cetera. So a really good foundation when
I joined.

I think the second thing I would say is actually putting the role of the
CIO on the management committee is really important and recognize the
importance of digital and IT to the future of the business. And that's
given me really good insight into the business. For example, I
participated in a 2-day strategy session recently, where the management
committee and the Board actually talked about the future of the group.
And actually, that allows me to, as a digital leader, to get ahead of
the game and, of course, as you bring in technologies ahead of when the
business needs it.

I think the second thing actually is, I think, organizations struggle
with the difference between digital and IT. Quite often, there's a gap
between the 2 organizations, quite often an overlap, and even sometimes
competition. So bringing them together actually allows us to leverage
the power of both digital and IT as an organization and to really
accelerate. And of course, that will build on the fact that we're
already the leading airline group within the digital sphere.

Actually, I'd like to acknowledge also some great support from the Board
and also the management committee and the operating committees that I've
joined. And I've been really pleased with how people have allowed me to
understand how the airline industry works, but also actually to
understand the individual airlines within it. And a good example is
recently, I spent 2 days at Aer Lingus on Thursday and Friday last week,
and that gave me a good insight into, for example, Hangar 6 and the
maintenance and repair operation that existed there.

I think the final point that I'll talk about since I joined is,
actually, I believe we've got the right level of resources. I think
we've got the right level of investment. It's just about honing exactly
what it is we're going to be doing.

So what have I been doing? So I've been looking at the business,
understanding the challenges that face the organization. I've actually
been spending a lot of work with our existing programs, reenergizing
them. And actually, I've introduced a new brand, IAGTech, which you'll
see a video of in the second.

Going forward, actually, what I'm actually looking at is actually how do
we do our digital and IT capabilities much more effectively, looking at
our strategy and enterprise architecture, and I'll talk about those in a
minute.

Our new way of working and greater transparency. But what I'd like to do
now is move into introducing IAGTech.

(presentation)

JOHN GIBBS: Okay. So just to kind of highlight a few of the things that
we talked about in there. If the thing works. So we brought together our
digital and IT organizations together. And the beauty of that is,
actually, we've got over 1,000 experts within the organization,
currently working around the world. And in the video said, 500 people
are already working on product and service development. And of course,
we have a world-class IT supply chain as well. So the key thing here is
bringing those 2 things together and focusing on a single vision, which
is around technology excellence.

You saw in the video what that looks like. And of course, we're already
recognized as market leaders in digital. And actually, from an external
perspective, I think that's what we want to become, which is industry
leaders. And of course, that's about challenging the norm and looking at
creative ways of using digital and technology. We also want to make sure
that we have a great customer service journey, and I'll talk about that
in a second, and also about the way that we operate in the most
efficient and effective manner and, finally, about empowering our
employees and being trusted by our stakeholders.

As I look forward, we decided that we needed a refreshed and common
purpose, and you have seen that again in the video around shareholder
value, business performance and delighting the customers, et cetera.

I think the importance here, though, is actually what we wanted to do is
ensure that we bring digital and IT across the group and the power of
our combined teams. And you can see here, we came up with the logo,
powered by IAGTech.

The organizational structure we put in the new place -- organizational
structure in place. CIO, obviously, sitting within the management
committee. And then actually, we're organizing ourselves in a more
traditional way around research, which looks at the 5-year vision.
Technology, obviously, looking in the short to medium term. Development
and programs looking at how we build a new capability. Operations and in
cybersecurity.

Willie talked about a hybrid model. And actually, in the case of digital
and IT, that's actually how we do this. So we have -- [but it's been
the] capability that we leverage across the platforms, across all of our
brands, and that's where we get real synergies around our processes, our
applications, our data and our infrastructure. And then we recognize
that the businesses need the opportunity to invest in capability that's
unique to themselves, so that's the point in which we have OpCo CDIOs
who bring the same capability, but from an organizational perspective.
And then, of course, we're supported by GBS in terms of our HR, finance
and purchasing systems.

Of course, we need to have good governance and control over what we're
doing, and that starts off with the Board. And I present regularly to
the Board on issues, like cybersecurity and our investment in
technology. As part of the management committee, we get a weekly
opportunity to discuss the progress we're making, our plans. And more
importantly, that gives me insight into where the businesses are
heading. So as an example, most recently, we were looking at the
operational plans for the businesses over the next 3 to 5 years, and I
can immediately see how digital and IT can actually help to transform
the business and especially on things like the sustainability agenda.

And on the left-hand side, what we're trying to do is get much more
intimate with the businesses in terms of the technology that they need.
So therefore, we have governance at an OpCo Exec Board level, which
allows us to ensure that our strategies are aligned to the business
strategies. And actually, our technology strategy is influencing the
business strategy and plans as well. And we also, at the same time, look
at our product -- project, operation infrastructure and services,
security and risk challenges.

On the right-hand side, this is where I lead the governance of the
digital and IT capability and ensure actually that we've got a regular
drumbeat of governance. And that, of course, starts with our strategy in
enterprise architecture. So for those of you who are not aware of the
term, obviously, the strategy is about our 3- to 5-year vision of
digital and IT across the business linked tightly with the business
plans. The enterprise architecture actually defines our processes, our
applications, our data and our technology. And you define that as they
are today, you define how they look in the future and you define that
road map. And this is really the opportunity to get real synergies
across the group. For example, common ways of working around customer,
engineering, overhaul, et cetera, et cetera.

And looking at the business, I can see some massive opportunities there.
And as I said earlier, the foundations that we've got from the
activities that the team have been doing before I joined really provide
that platform. An example of that being the hybrid cloud project, which
has got the Amazon Web Services as part of it.

In terms of portfolio and project reviews, this is actually checking on
our project status and program status. And actually, as we've been doing
that, we've been able to accelerate some of the projects and programs
we've already got. And then in week 3, we get into our operation
performance, so stability. And this is a real focus on the stability of
our systems, availability of our systems and ensuring that we're
learning from any problems and outages we have, doing root cause
analysis and continually driving improvements. And it's that, that
actually allows us to invest in things like the replacement of legacy
systems and also doing evergreening and patching and that side of the
things. The final week we do is actually look at cyber, our strategy,
our plans and we'll be using the NIST framework, and I'll talk a little
bit about that in a minute.

A regular review of cyber issues and every single incident that we have
and every single challenge we have, we do a very detailed root cause
analysis. And we're looking continually to improve what we're doing.

And then, of course, we work very closely with our old audits and risk
colleagues to ensure that any of the risks that we've got within the
digital and IT environment gets escalated up through the organization.
For the most serious of those that we'd obviously go to the Board and
the Audit Committee there and review the status of everything we're
doing.

The other thing we're doing is actually refreshing our operational
governance, and this is really how we manage our suppliers on a
day-to-day basis. So I've already talked about 1,000 digital
professionals inside our organization, but the world-class supply chain,
and we really need to get that world-class supply chain working
efficiently and effectively for us. And this is where actually we start
to use the strategic relationships that I've got with our vendors like
Microsoft and Cindy, the MD of Microsoft in the U.K. and then on an
operational level, making sure they're delivering what we've contracted
to deliver.

So I think, as I said, we're bringing 1,000 people together across the
organization under a common identity of IAGTech. And actually, the
development of those people is really important. And we're introducing
the concept of guilds, which some of you might have heard of. But
effectively, a guild is where you bring common practitioners together
and you look at the way they work, you look at the tools they've got and
the skills they've got, and you take best practices across the business
and you deploy it to the rest of the business. And this chart really
basically says, we'll have a number of different guilds and then
different areas of the organization where the best practice exists. We
identify that best practice and we then roll it out with increasing
levels of maturity across the business. And that allows us to track the
maturity -- increasing maturity of our digital and IT organizations.

Other things we're doing, we're refreshing our Professional Development
Framework and we're linking that into things like the British Computer
Society. And we're also linking that into the equivalent of British
Computer Society in our other markets. We just announced the launch of
our new IAGTech Apprenticeship & Graduate program. And that's going to
build on the existing programs that we're running for British Airways
and other partners.

And then coming back to looking for best practice, Vueling is an example
in Spain, have an academy. And that academy allows us to assess
individuals and also to develop their skills, and we're going to be
rolling that out the much more widely.

And I think, actually, in terms of the bottom, we got -- the normal
stuff around coaching and mentoring of what good looks like. But I'm
actually starting to get rotation of people through the organization,
not just within the IAGTech teams, but between IAGTech and the rest of
the organization, but also with our suppliers as well.

I think the final thing and, hopefully, the video talked a little bit to
this. But actually, I'm trying to create an exciting place to work
because, actually, technology is an exciting place to work. And IAG, as
a group, is a really exciting place to work as well. So what we're
trying to do is get that to mirror and map together. And actually, also,
to attract talent is more than just about offering good jobs nowadays.
We've got to introduce things that excite them beyond the job and
actually getting involved within activities such as STEM, where we
encourage young adults into technology, and charities and things like
that is another way of attracting talent.

So the next part of the presentation is really just exploring a little
bit about how technology is being used in the group already. So we
talked about Hangar 51 already. Launched in 2016, this is fourth
iteration, and we've just gone through this year. We have 7 categories,
and Willie, you mentioned sustainability was one of those. 474
applicants this year from 52 different countries, all coming together
with their ideas. We did a pitch day on the 3rd of September, which was
my second day joining the organization. An amazing event and very
inspirational. From that, on the day, we chose 11 finalists. These are
people we want to work with. As an example, there are 2 within the
sustainability area that we're working with. And interestingly, another
2 that we decided to go straight to collaboration with. So 4 finalists
actually who came out the sustainability area. And where they are now is
in a 10-week collaboration process, which, actually, at the end of
January will allow us to look at the demonstration and proof-of-concept
of that technology.

Now sometimes, people turn around and say, "Well, Hangar 51, you've got
great ideas, but does it actually get into production?" And the answer
is absolutely. And here are some of the proof of concepts we're already
doing. And what I'm going to do now is just take you through some of the
journeys. And there, you'll see some examples.

So anyway, so if I look at the journey, and you have to forgive me
because I'm new to the airline industry and new to IAG. So what I've
come up with here is planning and booking as the start. And then as
people are home selling -- to prepare for their travel -- preparing to
travel, check in lounge and bookings and boardings -- sorry, on board
and in-flight, arrivals at your destination. And then finally, carrying
out the purpose of your trip and then rewarding loyalty, which Drew will
talk about in a minute. And what you can see is new technologies
throughout this journey.

So if I talk about voice, as an example, a much more intuitive,
interactive way of engaging with the organization, we already have Alexa
and Google Assistant applications that allow people to get access to
their boarding cards, flight information and actually do check-ins. And
if people aren't comfortable yet with Alexa, as an example, and you saw
Alexa o the video, you can use your smart TV apps. And this is where
Iberia already got an application allowing you to do all sorts of things
about your journey. And I think what's interesting is you quite often
see the frustration of turning up in an airport with a bag that becomes
oversized. And then, of course, you're rushing around to try to get
stuff moved around between your bags, et cetera.

We've got an augmented reality application on your iPhone, which allows
you to look at your bag. It will put augmented reality size around it.
And you then know whether your bag is oversized or not, whether it meets
the check-in or not. I think that's great, and that will really help
people who really are not sure about what they can and can't take on
board.

As we go into the kind of the check-in area, I think we're really
leading the market around biometrics. And as an example, again, with
Iberia, facial recognition technology throughout the journey, allowing
you to quickly and easily check in, drop your bags and board on to the
flight.

Back to sustainability around digital newspapers. So obviously, we're
trying to get away from printed press. So now instead of actually taking
printed press on board a plane and with all the associated fuel and
costs associated with that, actually, you can download digital press
before you board and view the electronic versions.

Once you're on board, of course, we've got our Wi-Fi service .air but
also an e-commerce platform that allows us to provide ancillary
services. And as you get towards the -- your -- the end of your trip,
then, actually, we've got Mindsay conversational AI, where you're able
to ask your iPhone questions about the destination that you're going to,
for example, where are the taxis and things like that. And this, again,
is a really intuitive way of finding out information about the
destination that you're at. And of course, that allows us to build on
that platform going forward.

So looking at the next bit of journey, so this is around our operation.
So again, we've got planning and control on the left. Passenger service
in airports, baggage services, ramp management, departure, flight --
in-flight, sorry, arrivals and aircraft maintenance. And again, you can
see some amazing technology is being deployed across that. For example,
for those of you who that have blockchain, showing reliable real-time
information with our fuel management people. In terms of tugs, these are
the devices that you see big wide tractors, where people actually
connect to the plane and push the plane back. Actually, that takes a
couple of months of training, and it's expensive. And of course, it's an
environmental issue with the diesel, et cetera. We've replaced that with
an electric, remote-control tug. It takes 2 weeks to train. And
actually, it's much better for the environment.

You saw the automated dolly in the video. That's now into the second
phase of piloting. And this actually the vehicle is actually moving
around other vehicles in the airport, so it's around fuel trucks,
catering, buses, et cetera. So a real autonomous vehicle example.

Automated jetties, this allows us to speed up the boarding process and
also minimize the damage to planes as a result of overzealous airport
operators hitting the side of the plane. And then as we get to the top,
robotics in terms of baggage handling, so not just sortation but loading
the bags onto the planes. And then actually, on the -- in the middle,
using a combination of video and AI to spot for foreign objects on the
ramp, so that we actually avoid damage to the plane as it arrives or as
it departs.

As you get into the middle, we're looking at paperless workflows, so
removing and simplifying the process for the teams around the aircraft.
And then within the operations area, providing real-time information
about where the planes are in the airport, what we're doing with them
and how they're doing in the flight.

I think the thing that I find most interesting is the one that you saw
on the video, which is around machine vision and AI. So what we're using
here is a video to look at what's going on, on the ramp and then
artificial intelligence to identify the tasks and how long each task
takes. And what that's allowing us to do is to fine-tune the activity
that goes on around it. More importantly, it allows us to then come back
here and say, "If we could just speed this up with automated technology
for both -- or autonomous technology, then actually, we can really make
that operation much more efficient." And also, it's safer for the people
who work there.

And of course, what we're trying to do is capture data all the way
through this, and then we use advanced analytics to actually predict
problems with the planes, so we can then use predictive maintenance on
the planes to avoid the planes that are being grounded or taking too
long to depart.

And the final thing up on the top is, as I said, about going into the
hangar with Aer Lingus, and I'm looking at repair and all level of
maintenance. We're actually using drone technology to actually spot the
aircraft damage. And of course, what that does is it avoids you needing
to put up scaffolding around the plane or have people operating at
height, so much more safer inspection process.

I think the other thing we've done, of course, with this sort of
technology is try to look at it as across the journey as a whole. And
you saw how cargo are using that to do inventory management as part of
the video.

So it's not just about our customer journey, which is where we want to
be world-class, it's not just about having the most efficient and
effective operation. It's also about supporting and empowering our
employees. So here, I've just given a few examples of what we're doing
with our individual groups of employees. So on the left-hand side,
providing tools that will give us much greater insight into our customer
and allowing us to produce personalized services, especially as you get
towards the cabin crew. So if you board a plane, as an example, would be
a -- the new -- if you're a regular flyer or you return recently, then
actually, we can talk about your previous journey. We can also talk
about your preferences, for example, around meals and stuff like that.
And of course, bringing all that information together, then in selling
ancillary services and actually tailoring the offerings to our customer.

And the other benefit of that, of course, is when they get into the
loyalty program, we actually then use the data that we're getting from
there as well.

In terms of commercial teams, operation teams, a lot of this is about
machine learning, artificial intelligence and bringing in the capability
of the technology to help the business plan a much more efficient and
effective operation in terms of, for example, choosing what are the
routes that we want to fly and, actually, how do we maximize the revenue
on those routes and then through to ensuring that we've got the best mix
of aircraft, crew and pilots to deliver that service. And in this area,
as an example, we're replacing quite a lot of legacy systems with one
system and actually bringing in an integrated solution.

In terms of engineering, another example of doing the right thing with
enterprise architecture. So we're looking at the processes that each of
the airlines use for their maintenance repair activity. We're looking at
the different products they use and how the data is being used and
actually saying there is an opportunity to have a single process, single
system and a single set of data across all of the OpCos. And that
actually will give us real insight and actually able to raise everybody
up to the highest level and then everybody will learn from each other.
So we're looking at how we do the repair and overhaul capabilities
there.

And again, as I said earlier about building on the foundations that have
already been put in place, we've already done quite a bit around both
finance and HR, common systems and modernizing the systems in that
environment as well.

And we talked as an example in the opening slides about how data is
being used, and this is just really a case study using Vueling as an
example over the last 2 years to show how we've improved our maturity
around the use of data. So what Vueling has done is identified the key
areas that they want to analyze and use data to improve their business,
for example, in commercial, customer and corporate. And on the next
chart, on the right-hand side, that then basically says the increasing
levels of maturity from intuitive type of reporting. So effectively,
things like dashboards and that sort of stuff, all the way through to
prescriptive type of analytics, which actually help you make the right
decisions and has the most advanced forms of AI and machine learning in
there. And you can see, in 2017, generally, a low level of maturity, but
there are some level of usage. But just in 2 years, the level of
maturity has moved dramatically within that business. And you can see
the net impact is we've gone from 9 dashboards to 93. We've got over
3,000 users of data on a daily basis. And to enable that, what we've
been doing is investing in data scientists. So we moved from 20 data
scientists to 77. And of course, we're placing partnerships with Google,
Gartner and other people. So just gives you a bit of a sense of growing
maturity within the business around the use of data insights and
actually starting to use prescriptive analytics to drive the business.
And that story is being repeated across each of our operating companies.

So just in terms of becoming trusted again. Then actually, I think there
are 2 areas that we're investing heavily in. One is around
cybersecurity, and I talked about the NIST framework. And the NIST
framework is actually a U.S. framework for cybersecurity, which talks
about how do you identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from
cybersecurity incidents. And we're following that framework. And we're
also following the U.K. government's board advice and guidance as a
framework as well and investing heavily in each of these 5 categories.

And I've already talked about business continuity. So I mentioned the
fact we were investing in UPS and generators in existing data centers.
And of course, we're also investing in new data centers. And we're also
investing data migration and hybrid cloud projects. So again, great
foundations for moving forward.

And actually, we also talked about we want to be the best at what we do.
So we already talked about leading in the digital space as per the
independent study. What we want to do is actually be the best, not just
in digital, but also in terms of the IT internal delivery as well. So we
came up with these 5 things that we value, which you saw in the video.
And within each of these areas, we're driving improvement programs from
being innovative, not just externally using Hangar 51, but innovative in
exactly how we do things in every way of working.

In terms of being empowered, we're talking about refreshing the culture.
Today, as we've done this presentation, my leadership team has been out
doing the same to the 1,000 internal IT professionals and digital
professionals, and that's a really exciting thing. We've already created
a real buzz around digital and IT. And that's really important because
we need to be attracting great talent into the organization. And
therefore, there needs to be a buzz around IAGTech. And in terms of our
process and governance, actually, we've got some great governance, but
we need to simplify it and really empower our employees, so that
actually they can find the right ways of working and become much more
efficient and effective in delivering technology.

We're also investing in the tools for the digital and IT communities.
We've already got some great tools on the environment, but we're also
introducing things like ServiceNow to allow us to deliver better service
to our employees and be much more responsive to incidents.

For me, one of the most important things I can do is actually drive the
professionalism of the organization up. And I've talked about the
Professional Development Framework and I talked about alignment with the
British Computer Society and those sorts of things. And actually, here,
what we want to be doing is recruiting new talent into the organization
at all levels. And we've got some exciting individuals joining the
organization over the next few weeks and months. And similarly,
actually, it's about getting the academy. And for me, the academy isn't
just about developing IAGTech capability. It's actually about creating a
digital-first mindset across the whole of the organization. And that's
really important if we want to become a technology-driven organization.

I think in terms of transparency, for me, this is actually about
transparency into what's really going on in the estate. So we're putting
real-time monitoring across the environment, so we can actually see and
understand the problems and prevent outages rather than actually respond
to outages. And what you'll see as a result of that is an increasing
level of stability in our systems and that includes, of course,
modernizing those systems.

And the final thing is actually not about agile frameworks and agile
methodologies. It's actually about agility as a whole. So the whole of
the IAGTech community becoming much more agile in the way they work. And
that includes moving to agile spaces. And again, I talk about best
practice, but Vueling has got some great examples of how you create
agile workspaces. We're going to continue to roll those out across the
organization. But it's also about training ourselves in new ways of work
in either DevSecOps model. And we've already got 500 professionals
operating in a DevOps model. This is really the next stage of that
journey, the introduction in security, end-to-end teams who can deliver
products and services really quickly. And if you think about Shop Order
Settle, that's really important as we go forward with those
transformation journeys.

So my penultimate slide really is basically -- I've shown you some
aspects of digital and IT. But actually, there's an awful lot more we
can do and are going to be doing. The new vision and enterprise
architecture will be completed in quarter 1 2020. So by the end of that,
we will have a really good view of how digital and IT and technology as
a whole will look across the IAG Group over the next 3 to 5 years. And
that includes, of course, the opportunities, as I've said earlier, about
where process, application, data and infrastructure synergies can exist.
And that will allow us to then actually look at our investments and make
sure that the investments we're doing are the right investments. And the
initial look that I've had is they pretty -- they look right, and this
is about fine-tuning the investments we're making as opposed to massive
changes.

I think there's thousands of areas across the business where digital and
IT can actually really help the business. And actually, depending on how
you look at it, we can either drive those through shareholder value,
accelerating business performance, delighting our customers, and
enabling employees or protecting the business, the portfolio management
process we're introducing will ensure we get the optimum blend of that
because all of those things are equally important. So as we go forward,
we'll be using much more of a robust portfolio management process to
choose the right investments to maximize returns.

And in terms of our plans, some of the stuff that you've seen, I've
already talked about through the journeys, but there's a lot of other
stuff. We talked about NDC in the presentation earlier, but within a lot
more around global loyalty platforms, which I'm sure Drew will mention
in a minute. We've got a group HR platform that's currently rolling out;
revenue management investments; and also disruption management and core
capabilities like that. And we're also massively investing in our
infrastructure as well. So Windows 10 is a really good example. I think
we're quite well advanced in our Windows 10 rollout, Office 365, our
movement to Teams as a collaboration environment. So the fact -- again,
the foundations are there. This is really just about accelerating that
-- the deployment of that.

So my final slide is actually just to kind of summarize those 3 areas. I
think the first thing is we've recognized the challenges that we've had
around digital and IT. I think we took the right actions at that time.
And actually, we've then subsequently built the right foundational
projects going forward. And again, I've talked about those. So I think
that's a really positive position to start with. The introduction of
myself on the management committee recognizes the importance of digital
and IT to the organization going forward. And that really allows us to
leverage the capabilities that we've got in both of those teams. And as
I said earlier, by bringing them together, we've eliminated the gaps,
removed the overlaps and actually stopped the competition that quite
often exist within companies between digital and IT teams. And that's
been really well received by the teams.

I think we do have a really clear journey. That journey has already been
started. As I've talked about the foundations, I think those are the
right things. And what we are actually looking at is how do we build on
top of that. And I think the first thing is we do have the right level
of funding. So I'm not looking for more funding, I'm not looking for
more resources. This is actually just about fine-tuning where we deploy
those resources and how we use the investment funds and portfolio
management is a key part of that.

I'm hoping that, actually, you're really excited by IAG Tech. I
certainly am. I think we came up with a great brand there. We involved
our IT function and digital function coming up with that name. And
actually, the color of the green, actually, for me, actually links into
the sustainability agenda that we talked about. Because as I said,
that's a topic that I'm really passionate about.

And with that, we've renewed our vision and are really focusing on our
common purpose as an organization. And we've come up with, I think, 5
values, which I think will really accelerate the delivery of digital and
IT across the environment. And I think the new structure will help bring
clarity to people who work into the IAG Tech and those people who engage
with us to deliver new capabilities.

As I said, I think we're investing in the right foundations. Certainly,
we selected the right strategic tools. For example, Amazon Web Services,
one of the market-leading cloud providers there. And we've put over the
top of their services cybersecurity layers, which actually will protect
us going forward. And I think we've got a really innovative team in
Hangar 51. And by bringing that team together with the rest of the
digital and IT teams, we'll be able to really accelerate how we take the
Hangar 51 ideas through into the rest of the business.

And I think the final point for me is actually, and it's an advertising
plea I think, which is actually there's never been a more exciting time
to be part of IAG Tech. So thank you.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Thank you, John.

ANDREW CRAWLEY, CEO OF AVIOS, INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES GROUP,
S.A.: Thanks very much, John, and good morning, everybody. My name is
Drew Crawley. I think I know some of you. But for those of you who don't
know me, I'm the CEO of Avios.

So why am I going to be talking about IAG Loyalty today? When I arrived
at Avios a couple of years ago, the role of Avios and the P&L of Avios
has simply to sell Avios to third parties and make margin and drive cash
into the business. And I quickly realized that to do that, the value of
the currency is actually not determined in an area which I'm responsible
for. So that led me to think that a loyalty approach would be a better
approach because the value of the currency is established inside the
frequent flyer programs of the airlines. And the frequent flyer programs
of the airlines are made better by using the data that is available in
those airlines. And the technology that we use to make -- to allow
customers to work with us in a seamless fashion is also part of that.

So IAG Loyalty isn't just about how we monetize the currency, it's about
how we drive share of wallet in the operating companies and the airlines
using data really cleverly, making the journey for those customers
seamless and then being able to go out with a currency which has huge
value and sell it on to third parties who can enrich our programs and
drive cash into our business.

So what have I been doing over the last couple of years? Well, the first
thing is changing that operating model. That was the first job I
undertook. The second area that we wanted to look at was how can we
create a technology platform that makes what we want to do to customers
easier to deliver; and in addition to that, how can we create a
technology platform that allows third parties to integrate effectively
with us. We've got over 900 collection partners, 100-plus of those are
big partners who have been integrated into our ecosystem for a number of
years. They use old technology. All of the integrations are bespoke, and
they have batch processing techniques for giving us data. So it's a
legacy set of partner integrations that we have. If we're to grow our
business, we need to be out there and have technology that allows
customers' third-party collection partners to seamlessly integrate into
our business. So we spent a lot of time and money on developing a global
loyalty platform that is fit for today and fit for growing our business
and extending that collection partnership.

The third area that we've been focusing on is all the while we've been
doing all this internal stuff, it was important to continue to improve
the programs in the airlines. So we've been making incremental changes.
I'm going to cover some of those off throughout this presentation.

The fourth area is important because for us, in IAG, we believe if you
are issuing a currency to loyalty customers to drive loyalty, it's
important that they're able to use that currency. So the concept a few
years ago in some airlines, well, let's issue a currency that's not that
easy to use and then make money on the breakage. That is still a part of
all loyalty companies' models. But for us, the real value in loyalty is
engaging customers and driving share of wallet through the airlines. And
to do that, you shouldn't issue them with a currency they can't use. So
utility is important, and ubiquity where they can collect and redeem
those points is important, too. And that's a big focus of what we're
doing in Avios.

Growing our partnerships on the back of that, as I explained, will be a
lot easier when we get great programs, use data effectively and have a
great tech platform to integrate new partners.

And finally, to do all that, we had to change quite a bit internally in
terms of the management team. So all of my management team is new, and
we've made changes throughout the whole of Avios to enable us to deliver
what I'm going to be talking to you about today.

This is the schematic of what we've changed. So if you look at the Avios
rewards currency, all the way into B2B partner management, that's what
Avios used to do. And now we added these 3 things on the right: So
program design, how we can make programs more modern, how we can meet
the needs of customers, engage them better by making those programs more
flexible and giving more choice to customers. How we use the data that
those customers throw off. There's a ton of data that gives us huge
amounts of insights that we should be using in program design and in the
way that we're improving the way we interact with our customers. And
finally, digital services. I think the biggest area of improvement that
we can make, and we're making progress on this, but there's still some
way to go, is being able to interact with customers in a seamless
fashion. The customer digital journey that we have in order for people
to use their Avios can be improved. If you think about the modern tech
companies, the Amazons of this world, you make 2 or 3 of the thumb, and
you've got something on its way to you. It's not that easy to engage
with Avios through the programs today. So that's a key area, and we've
set up this digital services area to enable us to do that more
seamlessly.

As the center of excellence for loyalty in IAG, we also think it's
important to understand what's going on in the outside world. We've put
some themes that we found in the loyalty market, up on the slide here,
I'll just put out a few of them. Program design, what we're seeing is
huge, huge trends in personalization or flexibility of programs. So
having a static program probably doesn't do it these days. What we do
know is that if you take away some of the milestones within the programs
that people are targeting for, they get our -- customers get upset. So
in any new design going forward, we're not going to go completely
opaque. We're going to have some transparency, so that customers know
what they're targeting for, but we're also going to have more
personalization and dynamism.

I'll put out payments and loyalty converging. As cash usage shrinks and
card usage goes up, the opportunity for new products and services,
coupled with the fintech and open banking revolution that we're seeing
in Europe, throws off huge amounts of data opportunities and huge
amounts of opportunities for us to work with and be integral to payment
solutions. I'll come up and speak about that a little bit later.

Going around, obviously, we need to be on the devices that customers are
on, and we also need to keep customers' data safe and give them control
over the accesses that we have to it.

Top right. We've seen airlines spin out frequent flyer programs and the
currencies and then bring them back in. We never thought that was a
great idea. We think being integrated and close to the airlines is the
thing, and that's what will drive more engagement in customers and
higher value and share of wallet to the airlines.

A quick canter through something that you probably know already. These
are the schemes where the Avios currency powers. BA and Iberia,
relatively mature programs that we're modernizing over the course of the
next few years; AerClub and Vueling Club, relatively new and growing in
membership on a daily basis.

One of the observations about Vueling Club, people were saying, "Well,
is loyalty appropriate for the low-cost segment because they just buy on
price, don't they? Well, I think that might have been what Javier
thought as well at one point, until I showed him that actually top 10
routes in Vueling, 40% of the customers who fly on those are members of
the Vueling Club. And that gives Javier 2 things. It means he didn't
have to go out and acquire those customers. So he's saving money by not
having to acquire those customers. But they come back more often, and he
drives higher share of wallet in that 40% on his top 10 routes.

But probably more interesting and more importantly is the number of
customers who come and fly on Vueling from the other airlines using
their Avios to redeem on Vueling. That is a nice revenue stream for
Javier now, and I'm sure he's terribly grateful to his other colleagues
in Iberia, in particular.

The basic ingredients. I don't need to go through that, actually, in the
interest of time. Here are the number of customers that we're dealing
with. For comp purposes, we use the number on the left. This is a number
that you'll see from the hotel companies and other airlines. It's
basically what we define as the 3-year actives. So these are the people
who are in the program and haven't expired. On the right-hand side here,
this is the interesting one. These are the super engaged customers.
These are customers who are doing something within a year. They're
either collecting Avios or redeeming Avios with one of our partners, and
they are the people who we are really keen on growing, getting maximum
engagement from these customers. This number is important, but the 9
million is more important.

And to broaden the scope of our programs, being part of oneworld,
obviously, gives our customers a better choice and portfolio of network
to fly, to earn and burn their Avios on. So that's what we've got at the
top. We've also got a selection of partners, collection partners, where
customers can add to their Avios balances by doing what they do in their
daily lives with brands that they love.

And finally, on the bottom, we have access to the vast majority of
brands that any customer would want to collect Avios on through our
eStore portal. And a shout out to Avios hotels, those of you who haven't
-- aren't familiar with it, that's a white label on the Expedia
platform, which allows us to give 15 Avios per pound spent when you're
buying hotels at competitive rates that you'd get elsewhere. It's a
stunning product that we need to market more aggressively. So tell your
friends about it.

Why loyalty matters to IAG? Well, this is just a little insight into
some of the Avios numbers, and I'll come on to the broader loyalty play
in a minute. But what I like about this is it shows that we've got a
decent growth outlook over the next 3 years. The trajectory looks good.
We've got great issuance and good redemption. This supports the fact
that we want customers to use the Avios that we're putting out. Now
obviously, the issuance is growing a bit faster than the redemption
because the issuance, you have to issue for people to redeem. So that
will catch up over time. But we're going to get to issuing about 150
billion Avios by 2022, of which 110 billion will be redeeming in that
same year.

Now why is that important? Because these metrics are 2 of the metrics we
use to determine whether a program is healthy or not. So this looks like
healthy growth from our perspective for our programs. But also
importantly, from an Avios P&L perspective, it is rather interesting.
The Avios P&L has been growing strongly over the past few years, around
about 10%, and that we see continuing to grow over the period. And it
has 20% operating margin with very little capital requirement.

But the most important thing -- because the accounting is relatively
complex on the P&L side, but the most important thing is the cash it
throws off. Now this is not financial alchemy. This is not us taking
cash from the airlines and exposing it on this chart. This is cash
that's come in externally. And it's net cash. So we've taken off the
cost of the redemptions that we -- that our customers undertake outside
the IAG system and also the cost of the overhead from Avios.

So this is a net cash. And as you can see, by 2022, look, the annual
cash will have grown 50% compared to this year. And a good CAGR on that
as well. And that really is the interesting point about the Avios P&L.

Getting back to loyalty. This is the loyalty cycle that we are
passionate about. And these are the areas where we like to intervene,
using data to ensure that we are making this cycle go as fast as we
possibly can. So people fly on any of the number of our airlines, and we
enroll them into the program. And once we enroll them into the program,
we thank them for flying by issuing them with Avios.

And then we turn their head with another intervention, which says, if
you enjoy collecting Avios and here are the reasons why you ought to
enjoy collecting Avios, why don't you think about one of our non-air
partners? We've got plenty to choose from. Generally, at this point,
people pick up one of the credit card co-brands that we have. And then
they receive those Avios from that co-brand partner, and then they've
got a balance to use to redeem. And at the point of redemption, that is
when the engagement level goes up another level. So to get this
spinning, it's critically important for us to drive our loyalty business
hard.

This is one of the reasons why. So on the left-hand side, this is -- for
those of you who are familiar, this is the entry-level of the British
Airways program, but it's the same in all of the programs. For a
customer that is not in the program, they generate this amount of value.
Once they're in the program at entry level, the flying margin that we
can attribute to them is 3x that of a customer who isn't in the program.
And then when we turn their head and get them interested in collecting
outside IAG, they become 5x more valuable. These same customers, when
they make a redemption, even if they're not collecting elsewhere, they
become 5x more valuable as well. So you can see the reason why we want
to get that cycle spinning.

Now the way I look at this slide is as a world of opportunity. 33% of
our journeys, the percentage of customers who are members of our
programs, I think that we can get that up to 50%. If you think about
what the hotels do, that's generally around 60 -- 50% to 60%. Some of
the retailers' programs target 70-plus percent. So for us, I think 50%
is a stretching target, and that's what we should be aiming for.

On our top 10 routes across IAG, the penetration is a bit bigger, 38%,
but there's still room to grow.

On the right-hand side, it just gives you the -- I guess it's the fact
that the loyalty customers generate higher-yielding fares or are buying
high-yielding fares. So a good reason to do it.

Now this is the bit about the external cash coming in. This number has
moved. It was -- a few years ago, 47% of the Avios issued were from
third parties outside the IAG network. We've got over the 50% mark, and
we're going to continue to grow this through the 930 partners that we
have. The vast majority of these Avios come through the financial
services area, where people are collecting on spend, GBP 40 billion
worth of spends associated with the customers in our programs. And that
actually comes to 220,000 per minute. And the beauty of it is that
business comes back to IAG on our airplanes. So 89 billion Avios are
spent every year broadly on travel, broadly on IAG Airlines, which is 11
million reward flights a year. A few years ago, that was 6 million. And
the reward seats per hour was around about 600 million -- sorry 600 per
hour.

And what's changed that is that we have allowed customers to use their
Avios to discount commercial fares. Previous to that, they were
available on inventory that was allocated by the revenue management
systems. There were guaranteed amounts of inventory, and then it was
dynamically added and taken away according to the rev man demand
forecasts. But now what we have here is a product, which means that
Avios can be used on every single fare across the whole of the IAG
network, which means there is never any time when customers cannot use
their currency. And that's what's driven 22% growth in reward seats
since 2016.

This is an example of how that works out. And this is a flight to
Edinburgh that we took in 2016. It happened to have 15 reward seats that
were available. Add the Pay with Avios' ability to discount using Avios,
and you open up and 33% more customers end up being able to use their
currency. In fact, that looks like the schematic doesn't quite match up
with the 33%. So we'll change the schematic.

Right. This is the tech that I've been talking about. The fundamental,
the foundation is where you hold the points because that is where you
integrate and build out all of the products and services for customers.
And we've been adopting a new platform called the global loyalty
platform. Aer Lingus and Vueling are already on it, and the plans are to
put BA and Iberia into it. And what this will do is it will give us the
foundation to improve the customer proposition across all the programs.
So to do things like when a BA customer is flying on Vueling, they will
be able to use their BA Avios points to pay for food on Vueling. They
can't do that today. So this will enable a bunch of things, which we
think are right and the customers want to be delivered.

On top of that, we've built a micro-services layer with APIs, and that's
the modern way that companies connect with each other. The APIs provide
services that customers could integrate easily. So when we go out and
sign up a new third party or indeed replace the existing technology of
current third parties, we'll be able to integrate much more cheaply and
much more efficiently and much more quickly.

Typically, an integration used to take between 6 and 12 months and costs
us a decent sum of money. We're aiming for our integrations with new
partners to take between 5 and 8 weeks using these API platforms and
services.

And we can also build our own products on the back of these APIs. So
these are examples of products that we've built. The one in the middle,
you may be familiar with, if you're not, I would encourage you to
download it. There's a BA rewards app. That's the place to go if you
want to collect and redeem your Avios. It's got stunning offers on
there. You can earn stupid amounts of Avios for doing what you would
normally be doing, but doing it through that app, and we're rewarding
for that.

On the right-hand side is what we think we need to be doing for it to be
perceived as a modern tech data company, which is you've got a developer
platform. So that enables developers in other companies to come and play
in the sandboxes that we've created here and look at how they might
develop their own product propositions for their customers using our
currency, understand that they're developing that product through the
tech that already exists. It's not live. But when they decide that they
like what they're doing and they see the impact that can have, then they
come to us and we do the commercials. So that's how modern companies
work, and that's what we need to be doing.

Data. We've put all the customer data on to an intelligent customer
platform, onto which we apply artificial intelligence. And this gives us
the opportunity to do a number of things. We can model out any changes
to any of the programs and really predict how that will impact
customers. We're able to look at optimizing the algorithms for the best
price at the right time for the right occasion. So we won't be sending
customers redemptions which cost 100,000 Avios if their balance is only
70,000. So these are the algorithms that will enable us to tailor
effectively the offers that we're giving to our customers. We're going
to be able to put the customer in control of their personalization and
be transparent about AI logic. And on the top, we can, again, tailor
offers using that data which are unique to that customer going forward.

Here are a couple of examples of that. So if you've used our eStore,
which is the portal on which we have all these collection opportunities,
we're able to take the data of how you behave and interacted with the
brands on that eStore and predict the brands that you might want to
interact with going forwards. We're actually using the Netflix
algorithm, the recommendation algorithm that Netflix use, which is open
source and available to everyone. And we've got a 92% accuracy with
customers when we send them this.

Secondly, e-mails that we send Iberia customers to get them into the
nonair partner ecosystem, using the data to tailor what we offer them
has seen a 31% uplift in collection on those nonair partners. So it does
work, this stuff.

In addition to that, we've been adding choice for our customers. So our
nirvana is that any IAG product or service on any IAG platform, you're
able to earn and spend Avios on. And we're about 80% of the way towards
that journey. So Aer Lingus, this year, we launched Pay with Avios. We
have added seats and baggage to a number of the airlines, upgrades of
flights are obvious. We've been trialing upgrades on British Airways at
the airport. Customers have wanted to use their upgrade -- their Avios
to upgrade at the airport for a while now. We had a trial, which we're
looking to extend, and we're going to do that in Iberia as well. So lots
of things going on to make IAG collect and spend Avios in any which way
you want to on all of our products and services.

And then we've added more partners to meet more customer needs in
different -- on different demand occasions. So Budget is an addition to
our car hire portfolio, which is maybe appropriate to one of the Vueling
customers; Airbnb for our younger audiences as well; and so on and so
forth.

We've also been experimenting with pricing and looking at what customers
don't like about how they interact on redemptions. One of the biggest
insights was that they prefer to use less cash when they're coming up to
make a reward flight. So our introductory blue ribbon offering on
short-haul is GBP 35 and 8,000 Avios for a return trip. We recently
tested GBP 1 and 15,000 Avios across 100 destinations, and that now is
going to be our stock standard offering because it was super popular. As
you can see, 65% of the customers shows that. That one was available.
We're going to make that available as well. We're not going to take that
away. But customers will have choice and be able to use many more Avios
and only GBP 1. It booked a tremendous amount of seats over a very short
period of time with a 17% increase in bookings. So we're doing things
like this all the time, and this is -- once we've tested and learnt it,
we embed them and make them formal as part of our overall offering.

And this enables us to do this. This is an example of what we could do.
But if you go to market and you have a proposition which says you only
have to expend 50p for a flight as long as you've got 7,500 Avios. And
if you want to add a seat, you can spend a bit more. If you want to pay
for food on board, you can spend a bit more. So the total cost would be
this. Now I think that's interesting because if you're a family of 4 and
you want to go to Amsterdam -- and this is still available, this was
quoted on the 25th of October, but I just checked on my phone before I
stood up, you can still buy this. Or if you're not keen on that, you can
buy this. So this one goes from Heathrow on British Airways. This one
goes from Gatwick on a low-cost carrier. And this one is going to cost
you, what is it, GBP 325.88. This one for your family is GBP 2 and
34,900 Avios. I like this one. And there are still 8 seats available at
this price on this flight. So I suggest you get booking.

Finally, to enrich all of our programs and, indeed, to drive that cash
flow that I presented earlier, growing our collection of partnerships
outside IAG. We've organized along the lines of 3 verticals. The first
is financial services, which is the engine room, really, with plenty of
opportunity I'm going to talk about in a minute. The second is retail.
The real purpose of retail isn't to drive massive profitability, but
it's to drive massive visibility. So on a day-to-day basis, we want
Avios and the brands of IAG in front of customers because infrequent
flyers don't come across Avios or some of our airline brands as often.
So getting a day-to-day visibility of Avios and the programs is the job
of retail.

And on the right-hand side, we add this for relevance because we think
if you want to buy a flight, you might want to buy a hotel as well or a
car hire.

So these are the areas that we've organized around. And importantly,
financial services is the land of biggest opportunity, I think. So on
the left-hand side, we've got the standard co-brand cards. These are
staple of most of the big frequent flyer programs across the world, and
these are very successful. They work brilliantly for customers.
Customers love them. The NPS of customers who hold a card is higher than
the NPS of customers who don't. And they work brilliantly for us. We've
just re-signed with Chase. We've got -- we did a great deal with an
improved proposition for customers with Chase, and we're just promoting
that in the U.S. now. Amex has been around and a very long-standing
relationship, which works well for us. But we've got headroom for growth
here. So the penetration of these co-brand cards across our base, around
about 19%, 20%. I think there's a lot of headroom for growth here, and
it's good growth. So that's one area of focus, improving in that area.

The second area that we're looking at is "whole of bank." And to
understand what we mean by this, this is a -- it's becoming a much more
competitive area. In Europe, in particular, with open banking, you have
the neobanks on the right-hand side of this chart nibbling at the heels
of the large banks in the U.K. and across Europe. And we think there's
an opportunity to embed and either replace their existing loyalty
programs or add to those loyalty programs across the whole of the
banking portfolio. So you'd get rewarded for switching a current
account, you'd get rewarded for putting your salary into that current
account, you get rewarded for setting up direct debits and so on and so
forth. And once you've got that current account nailed, then you can
incentivize customers to renew their mortgage with you. And what we know
is that the cost of acquisition of customers in some of these areas is
huge. So if we can -- so there's a lot of margin available for us to go
and collaborate with these partners and ensure that they're saving money
by not having to go and acquire new customers, but at the same time, is
us enriching our offer for our customers. So whole of bank is
interesting, current account, mortgages, wealth management and so on.

SME is a great market. It's a growing market. It's one of the most
robust markets that we deal with. Even back in the financial crisis,
this was the strongest-growing market. So we think having a card for the
SME market, which they can add their Avios to their personal Avios,
that's a delightful proposition for small business owners. We just
launched this. If you live in London, you may have seen some of the
advertising, but we're pushing it really hard and it's gone down really
well.

On the right-hand side, I think there's a huge opportunity here for new
forms of payment. There are lots of products that I can think of. I'm
not going to divulge too many of them. But if you think about
account-to-account payments, that is an almost 0 cost to the merchant,
which gives you room to create products and services that you can sell
on top of that. I think it's an opportunity for the IAG Airlines as well
to look at account-to-account and push that. But I think, most
interestingly, there's an option for us to add loyalty and data products
and services on top because there's a fair amount of margin in between
what they pay today with the classic rails of Mastercard and Visa. And
there will be plenty of examples of that to bring out -- open.

We're also looking to launch a prepaid offering. We think there's a
space in the market. If you look at the growth of cards, credit cards
are growing, but debit cards are growing about 3x faster than credit
cards at the moment. So that's a bit of the market that we're interested
in.

And the Monzos, and Starlings and the N26s and so forth, they all
started off as prepaid. They've managed to generate millions of
customers. They don't make money. We know how to make money. And indeed
on that note, I think probably all of the neobanks have been knocking on
our door in the last 3 to 4 months because I think they're looking at
how they can differentiate themselves from the pack. So there are active
discussions going on the right-hand side.

There are active discussions going on here I'd love to be able to tell
you about, but there are big banks in the U.K. and Spain, which we'll
probably be talking to you about next year, very exciting conversations
and a world of opportunity.

Looking forward -- I'm pretty sure this is my last slide. We're going to
do a lot of what I've been talking about we're going to continue to do.
The bit in the middle, I think, which is interesting, is data and tech.
We need to reframe Avios as a data and tech company that knows about
loyalty. And we're on that journey. We've recruited the right
capabilities. We've got the right foundations that we're putting in
place. And importantly, what that will do when we're there, it will also
give us optionality of how we manage our frequent flyer programs across
IAG. It will give us optionality to decide. If we want a single program
across the whole portfolio, we'll have that choice. It's much like the
hotels, the Marriott Bonvoy and the Hilton Honors and so forth. They've
turned their loyalty propositions into a platform. And I think that
should be an area of opportunity that we should be exploring going
forwards. We need to get the foundations in place, but we're not far
away from that. So I think all in all, a very exciting time for loyalty.

Thank you for listening. I'm going to hand over to Andrew now.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Thanks, Drew. We've only got 20 minutes for a coffee
break. In the foyer outside, we've also got some exhibits that may
interest you, we've got a number related to our sustainability
initiatives. First one is Velocys, our sustainable alternative fuels
partner; there's Mosaic Materials, our carbon capture and storage
partner; and there's Ecosphere, our reforestation offset partner. We
also have people from British Airways and Iberia who can show you what
they're doing in terms of their own sustainability initiatives. And for
those who are more interested in luxury, we have BA's -- a working model
of BA Club World Suite that's on about, I think, 3 aircraft at the
moment. And we intend -- I think we intend to get to around 40 by the
end of next year and eventually 130 by 2025. So come back in 20 minutes,
please, and then we'll continue. Thanks.

(Break)

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Thanks. Right. We now have the second part of the
day. But kicking off with a presentation from Steve Gunning, our CFO, on
the financial investment case.

STEPHEN WILLIAM LAWRENCE GUNNING, CFO & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,
INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES GROUP, S.A.: Thank you. I'll just
let a few people get seated. Okay. I think we'll start. So good morning.
I hope you had a lot of coffee. I think we're into Slide 112 or
something more already, and I think we've got another 40 slides to go
just for me. And then Luis is going to give you some light relief.

So financial investment case. You've already seen this slide up, and
Willie and Alistair spoke to it. And it is a genuine way that we look at
our business. But when we've been going through the business planning
process this time around, it's been with a bit of a different mindset to
the one that we've had the last 2 or 3 years. There's no 2 ways about
it. The demand has softened. And you've seen it, and I'll touch on it in
a few moments.

We have been trimming capacity as a consequence of that. So this time
around, as we've been doing the business plan, it's been very much with
a different context that says, we need to be more cautious and we need
to see how to adapt the business in these softer environments. And the
way I've been looking at it is like this, IAG has built a very strong
core, and I'll take you through some of the reasons I think we have
built a very strong core as a business. But we continue -- we're not
complacent. We continue to make changes to it and develop it and
strengthen it. And I'll take you through some of those. But at the same
time, as we're looking at a weaker environment and I think Alistair had
a really interesting slide where you had lots of airline failures that
are taking place. And there will be more. Are we poised to exploit the
opportunities if we get into choppier waters?

And secondly, if it's really challenging, are we resilient enough
ourselves? How resilient is our business, too? All with a view, to all 3
of those prongs taking you to deliverable, sustainable cash generation
and sustainable growth. And so I'm going to use those 5 boxes as my 5
headings for this presentation.

Before I do that, I just want to sort of flag 1 other thing, a new CFO
in, been in for all of 4 months, we've looked to change some of the
metrics. Willie, the MC and the Board have been very supportive in that.

One of the other things we've changed in this is based on a lot of
conversations I've had with a lot of people in this room, there's been
some sort of question marks about, a 5-year business plan, really? How
well can you predict years 4 and 5? And I think that's -- I think it's a
fair challenge, particularly in an environment which is more volatile.
So we've come to the conclusion, let's guide for 3 years rather than 5
years. And that's why the numbers that you're seeing here are 3-year
numbers, not 5-year numbers. Just so you're not surprised. I will take
you through some of the new metrics as we go along.

So I'm going to take you through these 5 boxes, let's get moving. A
strong core. It's all right to look back but just don't stare. So in
terms of the business, we have been growing very profitably since the
inception of IAG in 2011. And you can see that in this red line. We've
continued to go from strength. 2012 was clearly a very difficult year
for a number of factors. But beyond then, it's grown strongly and
strongly. And what's interesting is there seems to be a point in 2016
where the global airline industry seems to have pivoted down, and we've
continued to go up. Willie and I were debating earlier this week, what
were the drivers of that? Was that the American carriers giving a lot of
their cost savings back? Is it the fact that fuel pivoted again and
started to go up again? I think there's a number of factors. There's not
just one. But it's interesting you see that divergence.

If I look at the operating companies within IAG, you can see they're all
strongly profitable. And you can see that their profit margins are, to
some degree, converging. Albeit with different business models and
different operating platforms, all of them strongly profitable and
performing well.

If we look at return on invested capital, we've had a huge focus on
this. Willie talked about this earlier, so I won't overemphasize it. But
we have been very focused on making our capital work for us and
generating good returns. And we have some of the best returns in the
industry.

And then at the same time, we've been strengthening our balance sheet.
And as you can see, our leverage -- this is pre-IFRS 16. These were the
good old days. Pre-IFRS 16, you can see our leverage has come down from
where it was even in 2015. So we've been strengthening our balance sheet
as we've been going along.

And then this slide, which I think is really important. Since 2015, when
we started to give dividends, we have paid back to shareholders EUR 4.1
billion of dividends. But what's more remarkable is 3 things. One is
we've paid EUR 4.1 billion of dividends and returns to shareholders.
Two, we've delevered during that time as well. And thirdly, which is on
this slide, we've made over EUR 3 billion of payments for pension
deficits, all in that period from 2015 to 2019. That should give you
some confidence that this business generates a lot of cash. It is a very
cash-generative business. I think sometimes we've lost it a little bit
in all of the numbers and all of the metrics, but this is a
cash-generating machine, very much so.

That's box #1 out of the way. So let's talk about maintaining and
strengthening the core. So we're not complacent. We don't think we've
got there. We don't think we have a finished article. There's a lot more
to do. Let's talk about some of those things. Now the first thing I want
to talk about is capacity. And I've alluded to -- we've done this
business plan with a different backdrop, a different environment. It
doesn't feel like the last few years. And as you know, in 2019, because
you follow the business closely, we have been trimming capacity as we've
gone through the year. We actually walked into Capital Markets Day last
year with a mindset of 6.5% capacity growth. I think we wrote circa 6%
in the Capital Markets Day pieces of paper. I think by the time we got
to February, we're down to 5.9%, and now we're down to 4%. We have been
trimming capacity. And we've been very candid that quite frankly, Q1 of
2019, we put too much capacity in at that point.

But if we look forward, what are we going to do for 2020? And what we're
guiding at the moment, we're going to grow our capacity just over 3%.
And that's not adjusting for strikes or leap years. That's all in there.
So our leap year is probably worth about 0.2%, and the strikes probably
would take you down to about 2.7%. But we're guiding at about 3% growth
for next year. And as you look at that, you can see that all of our
operating companies have moderated their growth. LEVEL, that is a
reduction on the LEVEL growth. It's primarily just annualization of the
routes that have been put in place, and also one new route, which I
think, off the top of my head, is Orly-Boston.

With regards to Aer Lingus, what you're seeing there is the North
Atlantic, the long-haul business is flourishing. And there will be
significant capacity growth there. But on the short haul, we will be
reining back capacity, actually short-haul capacity in Aer Lingus will
go negative.

If you look at Iberia, it's going to be growing our capacity on L.A. It
will be growing our capacity on Tokyo. It will be growing some of our
capacity to the islands. But otherwise, some reductions, LACAR being a
key area.

Vueling, no growth, no growth for next year. We are seeing weakness.
We've indicated that over investor calls over the last month or 2. And
we think, at this point, 0 growth is the right way to do it. We could
put some moderate growth in, but it wouldn't be sustainable growth. And
it needs to be sustainable.

And then in terms of BA, on that plus 3%, clearly, the 0.7% relates to
strike. There's a chunk in there that's for densification. And then
you've got the full year effect in of Islamabad, Mumbai and Pittsburgh
coming through as well.

So that's 2020. But what about the 3-year period? We're also moderating
growth there. So the last Capital Markets Day, we said we were going to
grow our CAGR 7.4% over these 3 years. Now we would have given you a
5-year number, but that was the 3-year equivalent. We're dropping that 4
points, which is a lot of ASK reduction to 3.4% CAGR growth, which means
our business at the end of year 3 will be just over 13% smaller than we
were anticipating when we did the Capital Markets Day last year.

That's capacity. Let's go on to fleet plans. I've gone around and had
lots of conversations with you, and some of the feedback I've got is, is
there this big CapEx spike coming a few years, 5, 6 years down the road?
And I wanted to try and give you some visibility of what is happening
with both long-haul and short-haul fleet deliveries. So let me explain
this slide to you a little bit.

This is the 3-year planning period that we're looking at, at the moment.
In there, I'm showing you the new aircraft deliveries that are both
replacement and growth aircraft. And then to give you some more
guidance, albeit we're only doing a 3-year business plan, I wanted to
give you more insight as to what's happening years 4 to 10. These are
the replacement aircraft requirements we have in years 4 to 10.

And really, you can see, I think, 3 stories come out of this, if you
have time to ponder it. And it's about replacing the 3 old-generation
aircraft fleets that have been the core of our business. The first one
is the 747s where we've been slowly getting out of the 747s, replacing
them with A350s, we're going to be replacing them with some 777-9Xs as
well. And we will be out of the 747s in early 2024. That's story #1.

Story #2 is the A340-600s in Iberia. We've begun to replace those also
with A350-900s. And based on our plans at the moment, we will have the
last A340-600 retired in 2025.

And that then leaves us the last big core fleet that will need to be
replaced over time, which is the 777-200s. We have 43 of those aircraft
as we speak. And that process begins in 2020 when we get rid of the 3 A
markets and replace those. And you can see that these brown bars here
are the replacement aircraft for the 777-200s. And by the time we get to
the end of 2029, we'll only have 8 of the 777-2s left to replace. And
that's the story of our short-haul fleet, both for 3 years and in years
4 to 10 on a replacement basis.

We do the similar exercise for the short-haul rather than the long haul.
And really, there's one really big story coming through on here, which
is the replacement of the A319s and A320ceo family and bringing in
either 737 MAXs or bringing in the A320neo family. So you can see us
bringing in the Airbus aircraft there. And then yet to be determined,
the mix between those coming forward in years 4 to 10. As you can see,
that does ramp up with a peak at the moment of 2024.

Now I need to put a health warning on this slide. Because in that 217
aircraft in years 4 to 10, there's about 60 aircraft that are what we
call an early accelerated replacement aircraft. We don't need to replace
them at that point. But we think for the purposes of unit costs, we
think for the purposes of being sustainable and environmentally right,
that there is a lot of argument for replacing those 62 aircraft early.
But we have flexibility. So in some ways, we've probably shown the
replacement profile in the sort of the worst-case scenario. So that's
short haul.

I thought I should mention the 737 MAX very quickly. In terms of
strengthening and maintaining our core, the key point for me on the 737
MAX is in a world where you have a duopoly and you convert it into a
monopoly because you don't deal with both on the short-haul aircraft,
that doesn't seem strategically to make sense. So one of the key factors
for us in the 737 MAX is not only getting a good price, but it's also
making sure that the supply is being competed over both Airbus and
Boeing. We are still working on this. We haven't reached definitive
agreement yet. We will let you know when we do.

Not only are we replacing our aircraft and renewing the fleet, but we
are doing a lot of reconfiguration of the fleet as well. And one of the
areas we know we have strength in is our business class product,
particularly in British Airways. And what this slide shows you is the
embodiment plan of the long-haul aircraft at Heathrow for BA. And as you
can see, it ramps up. And when we get to the end of 2021, we'll be over
50% of the way through the embodiment of the new Club World Suite.

This is an enormous logistical exercise, and I don't think people quite
get the gravity of it. I asked for analysis the other day. It's over
7,000 club [vector] seats that we're putting in. It's a huge number. So
when people sort of say, well, can't you go quicker? And the Board have
asked this numerous times, can you not go quicker? And the reality is,
the critical path is the supply chain from the seat manufacturers. When
you think it's 7,000 seats, you start to understand why it's quite a
challenge. We're very excited about the product. It's getting great
reviews and that it is work in progress, and it will strengthen our
business considerably.

Some people have -- in some interviews and some meetings I've had, some
people have been concerned very much about that this is 4-abreast
product. So it's far less dense. Isn't that going to hit your
profitability? Because, okay, the yin-yang seat's old, but it is dense.
So that's very nice, isn't it, from a profit perspective.

I don't know if you recall, but I think it was Sean and I, Sean who's
now running Aer Lingus. But when we were both in BA, we presented in
2016 the cabin reconfiguration program. And we took a holistic look at
the long-haul aircraft for British Airways. And to cut a long story
short, we said we needed to shrink first because the load factors didn't
justify all of that capacity. We needed to grow club by using some of
that space freed up in order to have a less dense club seats. We needed
to maximize the size of the premium economy cabin because on a square
foot basis it's nearly as profitable as Club World, and we needed to
densify the back of the cabin as well, go to 10 abreast on the 777s,
because all of our competitors have already done it. And what's
interesting is, if you look at this 777-200, that's what it used to look
like, that's what it will look like under the Club World configuration.
You see the smaller first, you see the more space devoted to Club World.
It's the same size World Traveller Plus cabin and actually there's more
seats in the economy. Overall, there's more seats in the new
configuration than the old one. We were very comfortable when we went
through this exercise that our cabin reconfiguration program was going
to be profit enhancing, not profit negative. So all of this investment
in fleet, what does it do to our fleet age? Well, at the moment, we're
at about 11.4 on our fleet age. Again, it's peaking in 2019, with the
investment we've put in place, it will be coming down and fairly quickly
over time. This investment in fleet is hugely beneficial from a
sustainability perspective, from a carbon perspective, we are seeing
significant fuel cost savings coming through in light of having these
new generation aircraft coming through. So when we talk about costs in a
minute, you'll see that coming through that our fuel unit costs are
coming down as a consequence of this investment.

So this brings us to the -- possibly one of the most exciting slides of
the day. I hope you agree, which is the CapEx slide. I've been relishing
the prospect of presenting this for quite some time. First point is
we're going to guide you now, gross CapEx, not net CapEx. So when you
look at, say, last year's Capital Markets Day deck, it will show in the
blue boxes, EUR 2.6 billion per annum CapEx. That figure was a net CapEx
figure. And what do I mean by a net CapEx figure? What I mean is when we
had sale and leaseback transactions, we will reduce the CapEx number by
the sale and leaseback proceeds. So when we've typically turned around
and said, we lease roughly 50-50 in terms of on-balance sheet,
off-balance sheet on pre-IFRS 16, again, forgive me. But when we said
we'd do that sort of 50-50, you can basically double the net CapEx
number to get a broad proxy as to what the gross CapEx figure was, which
would be just over EUR 5 billion. So in 2019 -- and that was for the
5-year period -- in 2019, our gross CapEx will be broadly EUR 3.8
billion, which is a relatively low year.

When we then look at our 3 years in the business plan, you can see that
our gross CapEx can be EUR 4.2 billion, EUR 4.3 billion, EUR 5.7
billion. EUR 5.7 billion looks particularly high. It's due to the
aircraft types that are coming in. It's also due to the PDP profiles
that are coming through as well. But that's the profile that we've got
for the next 3 years. And the 84% is, say in 2020, is the fleet element
and the 16% is the non-fleet element. So that will be things like IT,
property and certain product investments. So gross CapEx, not net, the
average for the 3-year period would be EUR 4.7 billion. Of that 85%,
which is fleet, which is the EUR 4 billion here, 11% of it is for growth
and 89% of it is for replacement. And then if you look at years 4 to 10,
our replacement average CapEx is EUR 2.9 billion.

I hope that's illuminating. There's stunned silences. So I'm not sure I
was expecting applause, but so this is our CapEx profile, I think that
gives you more visibility than you've had before using gross numbers.
One of the reasons I wanted to get away from the net CapEx numbers is
because sometimes it might incentivize you to choose a certain type of
financing because of the way it moves your net CapEx rather than for the
right economic reasons. And what are the right economic reasons? When we
look at how do we decide how to finance aircraft, we look at the type of
aircraft. We look at, is it a niche aircraft? Is it a commodity
aircraft? How long are we going to have it in the fleet for? What's the
residual value risk attached to it. And we also look at the overall
fleet flexibility. We'll touch on this later. We need to have a
proportion of our fleets on leases expiring every year to give us the
flexibility that says, if we get into a downturn scenario, we can reduce
capacity without any punitive costs. That flexibility is really
important. So you have to make decisions to ensure that you have that
fleet flexibility as well. Once we've gone through that process,
clearly, the funding principles you'll be very conversant with in terms
of minimizing the cost of capital, et cetera.

And then we have a lot of different choices as to how we choose or what
we choose in terms of funding the aircraft. What we've said in the past
is we would broadly use a guidance of 50-50. What we'll do going forward
is try and look at it on a case-by-case basis, using this kind of
thinking to make sure we are optimizing the way we purchase.

So let's bring this sales on to cost now. Cost is part of our DNA,
driving costs down. You saw some charts earlier that we've had some good
performance in the past, we'll have some good performance in the future.
It's interesting running through these. Fuel and carbon costs are down.
We have assumed in here that not only do we have EU ETS costs -- and I
think we've assumed EUR 23 a tonne of carbon -- but we've also put
CORSIA costs in here, about $17 a tonne in 2022 onwards. Our carbon
costs doubled in this 3-year period. Yet despite the doubling of the
carbon costs, our actual fuel unit costs are going down. And that's the
efficiencies of these new aircraft coming through.

What's interesting about that is our ownership costs are going up, no
surprise, you're buying brand-new aircraft and quite a lot of them. So
what's been interesting as we've gone through this business planning
process, we find ourselves having far more conversations right now about
the trade-off between ownership costs and fuel unit costs. It's almost
dragging you back to a world where you look at total unit costs rather
than this divorcing of nonfuel unit cost from fuel unit costs. I think
that's the way we'll end up going in future months and years. But you
can see this trade-off between fuel and nonfuel there on the ownership.

In terms of employer and supplier costs, I can't take you through all
the initiatives. There are probably hundreds of initiatives in our
business to drive these costs out across all of the operating companies.
We continue to target and push the operating companies to achieve a 1%
nonfuel unit cost reduction. We look like we'll get there on an adjusted
basis in 2019. And I did deliberately say on an adjusted basis because
internally, we do adjust, and we do talk about adjusted nonfuel unit
costs. And what do I mean by that? There are certain businesses that we
have in the group that generate revenues and costs that really aren't
ASK-driven. So Iberia, MRO, Iberia Handling, BA Holidays and some
aspects of Avios have nothing to do with ASK growth. These are
businesses generating third party revenues. So we want to strip those
costs out when we're looking at the airline nonfuel unit costs. That's
why we look at it on adjusted basis.

But because we're focusing on that now, and we're being sort of more
rigorous in that, I have looked at the definition that we've been using
for the adjustment. And we've tightened it up and we've sharpened it up
because very often, when we were adjusting out those costs, we were
using revenue as a proxy, which has been overgenerous to us. So the way
we've changed it, and there's a detailed appendix, I'm not going to take
you through all the details of that now, but by all means, send me an
e-mail. But we've been far more hair-shirt about this. So if we are
going to focus on adjusted, it needs to be robust, and it's not as
helpful to us as it was. So cost reduction, a huge part of the DNA, and
we continue to push hard on it.

So the next box. Are we poised to exploit opportunities? This shows you
what we've done in terms of mergers and acquisitions work since the
inception of IAG. And what is a wonderful thing for us to be able to say
is we've been very successful at this. We've been very judicious in what
we've gone after. We've been very judicious with the deals that we've
done, and they've all generated good value. They're all deals we can be
proud of. You saw with Norwegian, we looked at it, it didn't work for
us. We walked away. It's great to be able to see Air Europa up in the
end there. And Luis, I'm not going to steal his thunder, he'll tell you
about Air Europa shortly. But lots has been done. And as Alistair was
saying earlier today, I suspect there's more opportunities coming
because I think some airlines are going to struggle in this environment.

Are we poised and ready to be able to respond and take those
opportunities? The quick answer is yes. Our net debt to EBITDA, our
leverage is low, it's at 1.3x. We are using 1.8x as a proxy for
investment-grade. We would only go above 1.8x if it was a temporary
thing and it made absolute sense. But generally, we will use that as a
ceiling. And as you know, we're now investment-grade as well. We are --
we have a very strong balance sheet. We have a strong cash position. If
there are opportunities, we've got the ability to exploit those
opportunities.

So let's talk about the other side of the coin, which is, let's say,
it's really challenging, how resilient are we in that situation. Now
last year, Enrique put up this slide, the scenarios. I'm not going to
give you another scenario. That scenario is credible enough. What I did
want to do is try and give you just a little bit more color and a little
bit more reason to believe, as it were. It's interesting in some of the
investment meetings I've had -- in one investment meeting, they'd
actually photocopied this and put it in front of Willie and I and said,
can you just talk us through this one. People have refocused on this
slide, but I think we've got to go a step further, sort of says, what's
the underlying reason to believe.

One of the questions we get is have you just ridden the crest of the
market or have you really made structural change in your business?
Hence, if there was a downturn, would you be resilient to it. And what I
wanted to just do here is put up some of the huge restructuring things
that have been taking place in our business since its inception. Just
before we brought in BA mixed fleet following the cabin crew industrial
disputes, that was a huge step forward for us in terms of flexibility
and new contracts. Clearly, we've generated the synergies through the
creation of IAG. In terms of Iberia, probably the best airline
turnaround story that you could probably see going from losing EUR 300
million to making EUR 500 million profit, 3 phases of that, the Plan de
TransformaciÃ³n, the Plan de Futuro - my Spanish is great - and plan de
Futuro 2. Been working on that all day. But huge changes. And that first
plan, which I'm not even going to try and say again, we cut out huge
numbers of routes that were loss making. We took out an enormous number
of staff, it was really a painful process. Plan de Futuro, which Luis
headed up, a completely new strategy for the business, not a commercial
costs, network alliances and then Plan De Futuro 2 going from survival
into moving towards excellence. There has been huge structural change at
Iberia, and you can see it in their numbers.

If you look at cargo, we've got out of the long-haul freighters. I know
this because I was there at the time. I actually have a picture on my
wall, which is an interview. It's a poster from a journal where
Lufthansa are ridiculing us for getting out of the long-haul freight, as
it says, "never has IAG spun defeat so effectively." And I remember the
day it came out. And I went to my management team and I said, "We've
succeeded. They're talking about us now." But the cargo market's tough,
I'm sure, Lynne might get a question later about it. We're in a great
place, not having 4, 747 long-haul freighters on our books right now.
That kind of structural change was right. Why could we do that? Because
putting both the BA and the Iberia cargo business together gave us a big
enough network that meant we didn't need to supplement it with
freighters.

IAG maintenance strategy has generated tens of millions of savings. BA
has done a restructuring program. And then on the pensions, and I'll
show you a slide on that later, we've made huge strides on the pensions.
In terms of, for example, we can now pay 50% up in terms of dividends
without any further recourse to the trustees, whereas it was at 35%. The
EUR 450 million we were paying a year was going to go out to 2027. It's
now going to go out to sort of 2023, 2024. We're actually now coming in
to land on that program, so much so that one of the big negotiating
items was we didn't want to overpay. So we wanted an overfunding
protection mechanism.

There has been huge structural change in our business. If I drill down a
little bit further, if I look on the BA side, if you look at the amount
of employees now who are on new, more flexible contracts than they were
before rather than the old legacy contracts, you can see those
percentages rising all of the time. If I look to Iberia, this sums up
the Iberia transformation in 2 words. Headcount, down 19%, ASK is up
14%. That is structural change.

Pensions, I was alluding to a few moments ago, now our payment
commitments go up to 2023. Subject to court approval, which we are
hoping to hear the outcome of next week, the sort of blue bars disappear
as well, we no longer need to put additional money into APS. And so as
you can see, really come into a land -- a landing point on pensions.

So that's structural change in costs, let's talk about the sort of
revenue and brand side of things. One of the benefits that we have in
the downturn is we're diversifying -- have diversified brands that
they're working with different operating models. We've got full serve
carriers, we've got value carriers, we've got low-cost carriers. We're
in a well-diversified position if things were difficult. If I look at
our geographical split of our revenue by point-of-sale, basically 1/3
U.K., 1/3 rest of Europe, 20% North America, and the rest of the world
is about 14%, 15%. We're very well diversified from a revenue
perspective.

We've refreshed this slide from last Capital Markets Day to show you how
also our revenue is diversified, looking at the industry sectors. When
we went into 2008, 2009, we were heavily exposed to the financial and
banking institutions. Well, we've diversified away from that, it's now
only 2.7%. You look at this and you still say, I think one of the
figures, it would be good for us to get at some point is the premium,
leisure split. But if you look at this -- pink 48%, most of that is
going to be leisure, if you look at the non-deal premium of 20%, a chunk
of that is going to be leisure as well. So there's a good split. Over
50% of our revenue is leisure. It's true that leisure holds up better in
a downturn than corporate and business.

So let's move to another area, which is fleet flexibility. Now we've
traditionally given you those lovely line graphs with all the diversions
that you can take for each year. I thought we'd make it even more simple
this time around, which is where's our flexibility? Our flexibility, if
things are really difficult, we've got a lot of aircraft that are pretty
heavily depreciated, we could put on the ground, and it wouldn't cost us
to do so. There's not a fixed cost that we're going to have to
compensate for and that's particularly important for BA, it's
particularly important at Heathrow because of the slot rules there. You
wouldn't be putting short-haul aircraft on the ground, you'd be putting
long-haul aircraft on the ground. And so having a plethora of 747s still
and 7772s that are heavily depreciated gives us flexibility.

On the other side, as I was touching on earlier, we have a number of
leases expiring every single year. And as a consequence, of those leases
that we've assumed that we would renew -- so these are the red bars --
we could choose not to renew them. And that would then give us
flexibility in a different way, in a low-cost way to take further ASKs
out. That's why we think we've got resilience in our fleet if things
were particularly difficult.

Our liquidity remains strong. We have a treasury policy that we keep 20%
of last 12 months' revenue as cash. In fact, as you can see, we've gone
a bit above that in the last few years. So we think we are resilient if
it gets tough, and we think in relative terms, we're very resilient
compared to our competitors.

We're on the final straight, if that's any consolation. So last section,
the fifth box, let's talk about the financial metrics and where we've
got to with the plan. Before I give you the numbers, which you can all
see in the slides anyway, I just want to talk about the metrics that
we're using. Now the ROIC, operating margin, ASKs and EPS growth, same
as before. It's this right-hand side where we have made changes over and
above going from 5 years to 3 years.

Firstly, we have --what's a nice way to say this -- we are no longer
going to use equity free cash flow. I think there were some flaws in the
equity free cash flow number, not least of which it didn't include
pension payments. So I don't think it was a good measure of the cash
available for distribution, whether it's dividends or whether it's a
share buyback or whatever. So we've jumped to the answer, quite frankly,
we've gone to levered free cash flow. This is genuinely the amount of
cash that's left over after the CapEx, after the financing activities.
It's the last run before you draw the total. So we've shown you in the
appendix, my apologies, there's a slight mistake in the appendix. I
don't know if any of you have noticed it, but we've corrected it online.
But we're going to levered free cash flow. So we're giving you the
answer, quite frankly.

Gross CapEx rather than net CapEx, I think I've bored you sufficiently
on that one already. If you go to levered free cash flow, then you have
to have a constraint, a control on that because it is after raising
debt, et cetera. And I don't think you'd want us and we wouldn't want to
be raising debt in order to pay dividends, et cetera. So we're very
clear that we should have a leverage target or ceiling, and I've touched
on it already, that we would stay below 1.8 net debt-to-EBITDA ratio,
and we would stay within the investment-grade zone. So it's important if
you're going to use levered free cash flow to have this tension, this
other metric that keeps constraint there. So that's the reason we've
gone down that road. Those are the metrics we're going to use going
forward. And the management committee and Board have been very
supportive with that.

Where have the numbers got to? I'm pleased to say, despite the fact that
we've more than halved our ASK growth over this period, we still deliver
a 15% return on invested capital. And I'm pleased also to say that our
operating margin is still in the 12% to 15% range. And most of the time
in the top half of that range. In terms of ASK growth, we talked about
that; EPS growth, just slightly down, we guided 12% plus before guiding
10%. But that's not a huge surprise, given the fact that we've taken out
so many ASKs. The levered free cash flow averaged EUR 2.1 billion, which
is very, very healthy. Gross CapEx, we've talked about before, the EUR
4.7 billion. And then, as I say, net debt-to-EBITDA up to 1.8 and
keeping the investment grade.

I think it's been a good test for us to say, if we took out so much
capacity would the numbers hold up? The numbers have held up when we've
been through the planning exercise. Which brings you to one last
thought, which is what's our cash return to shareholders thinking? Now
this is what we've said -- I think this is what we said at the half too
-- our cash priorities are around organic growth, then commitment to a
sustained dividend then inorganic growth. We're not -- make any new
announcements on this today. We are having conversations with the Board.
We're having conversations with MC as to what is the right way forward
for us. We think there's more flexibility than we've had in the past. We
think with the pensions changes that enable us more flexibility to move
cash up to the group, there is a possibility and an ability to maybe do
something different going forward. That's something that we would
revisit when we come to the full year results rather than right now.

This slide, I'm not going to talk to, but we've provided you this
guidance in the past, and we wanted to give you that guidance again.
Those are the 5 boxes. So the narrative that we've gone through is we've
built a strong core. We're maintaining and strengthening it. We think
we're poised to exploit opportunities. We think we are resilient and all
with a view to delivering strong cash generation. And that's the
conclusion basically. We've gone through this process, and we're pleased
that we've managed to hold to our targets.

And that's it from me. I'll hand you over to Luis now to talk about
something far more interesting.

LUIS GALLEGO MARTÃ­N, CHAIRMAN & CEO OF IBERIA, INTERNATIONAL
CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES GROUP, S.A.: Okay. Good morning, everybody. I'm
sure that you heard last Monday to Willie and Steve talking about this
transaction. So I'm going to be brief. I think the first thing to say is
that this operation fits perfectly what Alistair said this morning. You
know that the strategy of the group is to have a portfolio of
world-class brands, also to develop our positioning, our global
positioning in the world and in our core markets, and also to try to
leverage our platform to try to improve our cost and also to be more
effective.

And if I have to group all the advantages of this operation I would say
that we can group in 3 topics. Madrid hub, customers and our people. If
I start with Madrid hub, Madrid hub is weaker than the major European
hubs that we compete with them. And we have less flights, we have less
international destinations. We serve less countries. And it's a hub that
is oriented to the Atlantic, but mainly to South Atlantic. And with that
size, it's difficult to compete with the big ones. With this operation,
we are going to have 63 aircraft, long-haul aircraft. So we are going to
be very similar to the 65 that KLM has. We are sure that we are going to
develop our 360-degrees hub because we are going to look to other
regions that now are impossible for us, and we are pretty sure that, for
example, traffic from Asia to Latin America through Madrid is something
that can be developed for sure.

And one thing that is also important, Willie said at the beginning that
Madrid has capacity to grow. That's true, for sure. But we are having
now a problem in the peak times of the hub. We are arriving to our limit
there. When we will combine the 2 hubs, the structure, between Europa
and Iberia, I am sure that we can create a smoother hub, and then it
will reduce the peaks we are going to develop even more the airport.

Talking about the customers, I'm not going to cover this slide but this
one. I'm going to cover this one. That is only one that you didn't see
on Monday. First thing is to say that the Spanish international air
travel market will remain highly competitive. We can see here the market
share by airline in Spain in international traffic. And we see that
Ryanair, even with this operation, will have 20% of the market share.
And IAG will move from 17% to 19%. If we look to the domestic market, we
need to take into consideration that in Spain, we have a lot of
kilometers of high-speed train. Spain is the first country in Europe in
number of kilometers of high-speed train. And it is the third one in the
world. So when we compare -- when we see the domestic market, we need to
take into consideration that mode of transport. So in the right-hand
side, you can see the domestic market share to/from Madrid, including
the high-speed train. And you see that even with this operation,
high-speed train will have 53% of the market, and IAG will move from 26%
to 37%. If we only look to the domestic market share by airline in
Spain, we will move from 52% to 66%.

Other important thing is the network. The combined network that we are
going to generate is going to be a huge opportunity for our customers.
Combining the unique destinations that we fly in Iberia and the unique
destinations that Air Europa has, we are going to have around 1,000 new
O&Ds that we are going to serve with only one stop. So our customers,
they are going to have more flexibility, better schedules and more
choices. And also, they are going to enjoy a modern fleet because we are
going to have all the new fleet that, as Steve said before, we are now
joining in Iberia, the 350s, but also, we are going to have the 787 that
Air Europa is incorporating in the fleet. And that will help also to the
objectives of sustainability that Willie said before. We consider also
that the dual-brand strategy in Madrid is key in order to attend the
different customer segments' needs that we have there.

And finally, the IAG platform will help us to provide more opportunities
to our customers. We are sure that we are going to reduce the cost
structure. And with that reduction, we will invest more in all the
things related with the customer. For example, the VIP lounges or the
connectivity of the aircraft, et cetera. Also, to be more efficient in
cost will allow us to be more competitive in prices, as we have been
during the last year. And I think we have an opportunity also in the
loyalty program that Drew said before. Combining the loyalty programs,
we are going to give much more opportunities to our customers.
Customers, sorry.

And finally, talking about our people. I think this is a future
opportunity for them. If we create something stronger, it's something
that is going to help to protect employment, and I assure that we are
going to develop further opportunities for everybody working in the
group. As we have seen also before. IAG has a track record of developing
the investments that we have done during these years. Vueling, Aer
Lingus are examples of business that we have developed, and now they are
much bigger than when we started those operations. And I am sure we are
going to generate a lot of opportunities for our people.

And one last thing is that after the announcement, the main unions and
the main travel agencies, they have said that they are supporting this
operation. And I think that is because they see this in the same way we
see. They see that this is good for Madrid hub and then it's good for
the economy and also for tourism, it's good for all our customers and
it's good also for all of our employees. Thank you. Now I'm going to
hand over to Willie.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: I'm going to summarize everything you've heard
today, but I hope you've got a flavor of what it is we've been saying
for some time. We've clearly structured this group well, make no secret
of the fact that we learned from what others did well and what others
did not so well. We've got the right structure, we've got the right
people. We've got a deep pool of talent, and where we want to, we can
attract people into the business to supplement the talent that we have.

We're well prepared for anything that comes at us. We see a softening
economic environment, and therefore, we're adjusting our growth plans.
We still see growth. That's an important point to make. But we're
moderating our growth. And even in that environment, as you've seen from
the presentation from Steve, we will be generating very significant
amounts of cash to be able to ensure that our shareholders get rewarded
for their faith and their investment in our business.

So our 3-year plan is robust. I think we've been very clear in terms of
what it is we need to do. We're building on a very strong track record
of performance. We're pursuing further inorganic growth, which is why we
created IAG in the first place. We think the acquisition of Air Europa
is going to be really exciting for IAG. But very important, as you've
just heard from Luis, we think it's great for Spain. We think it's
excellent for Madrid. This will move Madrid into a position to be able
to be a global hub rather than just a European hub. So this is a good
news story. We have to engage with various different groups, including
the competition regulators. That activity is going to take place over
the coming months, and we hope to close this deal in the second half of
next year.

So a lot to look forward to in 2020. Clearly, some challenges ahead. But
everything you've seen today should convince you that this is a business
that is well-positioned to take advantage of any opportunity that comes
our way. And more importantly, this is a business that's in an extremely
well-positioned, particularly relative to our competitors, to deal with
any problems, any downturn, any challenges that might come our way in
the future.

So Steve is going to join me up here. I think Andrew is going to deal
with the questions. We have some microphones. The rest of the management
committee are here, they're all going to be available to answer your
questions. And we have a couple of other people from IAG who may step in
if their bosses can't answer the questions eloquently. But I'm assuming
they will.

So I'll hand over to Andrew now, and then we'll take Q&A for about an
hour, Andrew?

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Yes, we've got till 1:30, so about 50 minutes. And
can I make it, just a maximum of 2 questions. Preferably just one.

Questions and Answers

CAROLINA BOTACINI DAS DORES, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Okay. Carolina Dores from Morgan Stanley. I'll start with two.
One is very quick. On Avios, it's the GBP 600 million of free cash flow.
Is that compared to the GBP 2.1 billion of cash flow available for
distribution? Because if it is, my question is, this is around 25% of
the group's free cash flow, how much can it grow? Can it be 30%, 40% or
is 25% the maximum proportion of free cash flow that Avios can get?

And my second question is for Willie, I saw an interview where you said
that within 2 years, you don't plan to be in your position. So I guess,
have you had a talk about succession plans?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Let me deal with the second one while Steve and
Drew -- so I think I foolishly, when I was much younger, said I would
retire when I was 55. And when I got towards 55, I realized that was a
silly thing to do. But having put it out there, it's clearly been an
issue that a lot of people have asked me about over the last few years.
I'm 58 now, I think, in fact, some people have written some articles
saying, I have retired. I haven't. I'm still here. But I think to be
fair to everybody, and especially the Board, who have been incredibly
supportive of me -- I have indicated that I'm clearly getting closer to
retirement rather than further away from it. And the Board has been
working for some time as you would expect them to do, on succession
planning, not just for my role, but for all of the senior positions
within the business.

So I still love what I do but my intention is to be retired within the
next 2 years. As to when that point will come, it will be something that
I have to discuss with the Chairman and the rest of the Board. But yes,
I'm going to keep a promise, I'll be retired by the age of 60. Before
I'm 60, so I'd be 60 on the 25th of October in 2 years' time and I
intend to retire by then. And on that happy note.

STEPHEN WILLIAM LAWRENCE GUNNING: Thank you. In terms of the free -- it
reminds me a bit of when I was running the cargo business because I
would show the cargo contribution and make it look like I'm generating
all of the profit for the whole group. I think the reality to Drew's
point is Avios supports that level of free cash flow, undoubtedly. Is
all of that free cash flow in the Avios business? No, it's not. Some of
that's sitting in other parts of the subsidiary. But I think at the
heart of your question is can the business grow more. And then Drew, I
don't know whether you want to comment on what you think the growth
prospects are.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Drew is going to say, yes, it can.

ANDREW CRAWLEY: I think the growth prospects are very good. More
seriously though, the thing that will dial up our ability to generate
more cash is the degree of penetration of frequent fliers we get into
our businesses, that 33% number. If you get up to 50% -- those plans
that we have with that level of cash flow, don't assume that we'll get
to 50%. So if we do get to 50%, there are multiplying effects across the
whole piece. And so collection goes up, the attractiveness to third
parties goes up. And that's what drives that third-party cash flow. So
yes, I think the answer is yes. I think we've got plans in place, which
will grow that penetration, I would like to be able to do that faster.
And that's what we're planning on doing.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: And I think this is one of the important reasons
why we've said in terms of how we're structured today and how we're
structured into the future. I don't think businesses, particularly
airlines, fully appreciated the value that can be generated from
frequent flier programs, loyalty programs. A lot of the models were
based on issuing points and then hoping people don't redeem them. What
we've learned, and particularly since Drew has taken over and the
detailed analysis of the data is reinforced in the presentation that he
gave you, the more engaged you can get your customers in this, the more
value you can create. And we're taking a fresh view on this, but to
really exploit this, we need to move the whole culture in relation to
loyalty away from where it's traditionally been within the airlines to a
point that we can be more effective doing this centrally.

And the reason I say that is because -- and this is no disrespect to
people in the airline. Often, the decision-making in relation to these
loyalty programs has been at low levels within the business, where they
don't fully appreciate the financials associated with it. And that was
something that became clear to me when I joined BA. I don't think the
people there really appreciated the value of the points. And I used to
see -- a customer would write a letter to complain, and we'd answer that
by saying, here's some points or, as it was at the time, here's air
miles. Somebody would write a complimentary letter, we give them air
miles. And quite honestly, people just didn't value, inside the
business, they didn't value what they were doing, didn't understand that
this money and that this money was something that could be absolutely
capitalized on.

I think Drew and his team have been able to reinforce the real value
that's in there. So we're really excited about it. But as we said, to
fully exploit this, I think what we've got to do is recognize that we
now have a center of excellence within Avios, a center of excellence
within IAG loyalty. And that's why we're looking at changing the way we
manage that program to ensure we can fully exploit the value that we
believe is there.

RISHIKA DIPAK SAVJANI, ASSISTANT VP, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH
DIVISION: It's Rishika from Barclays. My first question is on one of the
very early slides you presented at the beginning around -- taking some
the processes that you do currently at the Opco level or in the hybrid
kind of format towards more IAG group level. So I was just wondering, do
you think that the team within IAG is well invested? And obviously,
you've added in the CIO role, it sounds like you've upgraded the Avios
team but is there more investment in people, whether it's senior
management or bodies that's necessary at IAG Group?

And then my second question is just on sustainability. I think it's very
clear and it comes across well what the group is trying to do over the
next kind of few years to help the environment. I wanted to ask a bit
more about what support you think you need from the wider ecosystem? So
maybe things like greater policy support in areas such as in fuels or
more support from infrastructure, what else is required within the wider
system to help airlines deliver what they're trying to deliver on the
topic of sustainability?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Yes. I think in relation to talent, I believe we
have the talent within the business. But as Drew said, when he gave his
presentation, he's changed the management team. And he's changed the
emphasis and the expertise. And I think one of the things we've realized
is to do this properly, you need to have professionals. You need to have
experts who understand it, particularly when it comes to data, the data
analytics. You've got to have the right tools. You've got to have the
right infrastructure, I mean you have to have the right people. And it's
difficult to make the case that you can grow those people internally.
You've recruited somebody to do something completely different and you
turn them into a world-class data analyst. Our view is no. We believe
that there is resources. There are resources that we will need to bring
into the business. And that's the great thing about us. We're a very
attractive group to work for and we have no difficulty attracting people
to join us. But yes, we think there will be a change in emphasis in some
areas where we will need to bring further talent within the business.

And on sustainability. There are things that could help us. And the one
thing I would say -- and I don't normally say things positive about
politicians -- but I think the message has landed here in the U.K. We've
got the government to acknowledge that support -- financial support for
the development of a sustainable aviation biofuel is important.
Previously, there was financial support for sustainable biofuels for
road transport. When in reality, there is a more credible alternative
available for road transport through electrification that isn't
available to us. So further support in the area of research and
development, particularly where it pertains to sustainable biofuels, I
think, is important in the short term. But we are making progress, and
we are landing the message. We've just got to make sure that the message
around what our industry is doing and what we're doing within the
industry is heard and understood by -- particularly by our customers
because we need to make them feel comfortable about continuing to fly
with us. And we believe they should be comfortable about continuing to
fly with us. But that story, that needs to be told in a better way than
maybe we've done in the past.

ANDREW LOBBENBERG, HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN TRANSPORT TEAM, HSBC, RESEARCH
DIVISION: It's Andrew Lobbenberg from HSBC. Can I ask on Air Europa? As
you look to a future combining Air Europa into the family and with the
other Spanish brand, is it going to be a case that the network and fleet
ends up being slightly smaller than it would otherwise have been as you
consolidate the overlap between them? Or is it a case that it will grow
faster as you might look to the example of Aer Lingus, which took off
its growth as we go forwards?

And then my second question would be around the industrial dispute that
plays out at BA with the pilots. I think if we look into the causes of
it, there was a very hot debate around profit sharing. And it seemed a
lot of enthusiasm for profit sharing from the pilot group, and that was
obviously a debate. What's your attitude -- rather than getting
necessarily into the weeds of the dispute specifically, which you
shouldn't want to do anyway, I'm sure -- what's your attitude towards
embracing profit share or resisting it across the group or at the Opcos?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: On Air Europa, I'm not going to say too much
about Air Europa, other than to point to, as you've done yourself,
Andrew, what it is we've done with Aer Lingus, where Aer Lingus had --
well, what I would describe as an ambitious plan to grow, which, as a
stand-alone entity, would have been risky. What we've done with Aer
Lingus is not only have we supported what was for them an ambitious
plan, but we've actually accelerated it. And we believe that, that
opportunity exists within Spain as well, strengthened the Madrid hub to
make that hub more efficient and a genuine global hub in the same way as
with Aer Lingus, what has facilitated the very strong transatlantic
growth in Aer Lingus is making Dublin a transatlantic hub. So there's a
lot of work that we need to do in relation to Air Europa. And clearly,
we have stated that we'll need to rationalize the number of brands we're
operating.

The recent very clear dual-brand strategy at the Madrid hub is an
effective model for us, and we fully support that, and we think that's
right based on everything that we have seen so far. But clearly,
operating with the number of brands we have in that segment of the
market doesn't make sense. So there is work that we will do, and we'll
share that with you. But our focus between now and closing this deal
will be making sure that those other parties that are going to examine
this are clear and understand what it is we're doing. Alex is here. I'm
going to let him comment a little bit about BA, just so you get a flavor
of where it is.

But our attitude to profit share is very clear. We already engage in
profit share. And we have no issue with it. The business has to be
sustainable, as I've said in the presentations on environmental grounds
and on financial grounds. And we want people to be excited about working
here, and we want people to be excited about what it is we're doing in
the future. But it's got to be done on a reasonable basis. And it's
going to be done on the basis of guaranteeing the sustainability. And
I've always said that one of the greatest challenges that the airline
industry has had is the boom to bust where we've been too short-term
focused on short-term profitability rather than long-term, sustainable
profitability. And that's what we want to do. And I think that's what
we've done very successfully.

We want the best people working for us. We want them to be excited about
working for us. We want them to be committed to serving our customers.
We want them to be committed to going out of their way to make sure our
customers are delighted with everything we do. And we believe that's the
future for IAG. We've got a great story to tell, and it's an exciting
group to be part of. And I have no doubt that, that's where we will get
to.

Alex, do you want to just comment briefly?

ALEJANDRO CRUZ DE LLANO, CHAIRMAN & CEO OF BRITISH AIRWAYS,
INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES GROUP, S.A.: Perhaps a very super
short comment because I shouldn't be commenting whilst we are having
discussions with ACAS -- via ACAS with the pilot union. I would only say
that there's progress has been made and we're very hopeful that we will
reach an agreement at some point. And I think Christmas is a good day to
be looking forward to it. But progress has been made. And again, lots of
discussions taking place in the background at the moment.

NEIL GLYNN, HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN TRANSPORT TEAM AND GLOBAL TRANSPORT
SECTOR COORDINATOR, CRéDIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Neil Glynn from
Crédit Suisse. If I could also take two. The first one, with respect to
your position with Qatar Airways.

It's -- I guess it's nearly 5 years since they took the stake. They're
obviously your largest shareholder, and I can see positives and
negatives. And I'm interested in your view in terms of how they
influence your strategic position going forward. I mean on the negative
side, they're obviously the largest non-EU shareholder, which is a
little bit of a question mark at the moment. And of course, their
relationship with American also, I presume, prompt challenges in some
areas, whereas I can also see opportunities in terms of potentially
cooperating with some other Qatar Airways investments even Air Italy.

So I'm interested in terms of how you put those pieces together, whether
it's working for you now and what the opportunity is in the future. And
then tied to that, the non-EU shareholding or share purchase block at
the moment. I presume it's an area of focus to ultimately get that
removed. Interested in your thoughts on latest developments there. And
is there any kind of time line to think about?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Okay. On Qatar, they don't influence our
strategic thinking at all. They're very supportive as shareholders, but
we don't have any consultation with them in terms of where the business
is going. The first they would have heard about the Air Europa
acquisition was when we announced it publicly. So they're a very good
long-term financial investors, I would say.

Now does that interfere with other things? The relationship between
Qatar and American is fun. I have a front row seat to it because I often
get invited into sort of referee between Doug and Akbar, which is great
fun. But I think what you've seen, which is very interesting, the
investment by Delta in LATAM, where Qatar is a 10% shareholder, and the
impact that, that has on American's relationship with LATAM tells you
that things have changed. And I think you're going to see a very
different -- I would expect to see a different attitude from American
towards Qatar as a result of that.

So the 3 big U.S. carriers clearly aligned themselves, led by Delta, to
oppose Qatar Airways, while at the same time, they were doing everything
to support themselves. So I think you'll see a change in attitude there.
But Qatar doesn't -- we don't consult with them on any of the strategic
issues. They're an investor. We give them information in the same way as
we give every other investor.

In relation to the non-EU shareholding, I can just refer you back to
what the Chairman said at the beginning, the restrictions that we have
in place at the moment, we want to see removed. There is a lot of
activity going on. I'd love to be able to share with you, but I don't
think that would be constructive at this stage because, clearly, we need
to have constructive dialogue with a number of relevant authorities
first. But there is a lot of activity going on behind the scenes, and
we're confident that we will get to the right place.

Chris Haynes, our General Counsel, will probably tell me now to stop
talking at this point. Maybe, Chris, I don't know if you want to say
anything, but I don't -- no? He doesn't. He just stares at me and
reinforces his view that I should stop talking at this stage.

JAMES EDWARD BRAZIER HOLLINS, SENIOR TRANSPORT ANALYST, EXANE BNP
PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's James Hollins from Exane BNP. Very
sorry you're blowing the final whistle, Willie, soon. Good to see you're
still dressing a man half your age. And given you're leaving...

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: I'm not going to answer your question.

JAMES EDWARD BRAZIER HOLLINS: Actually, given you're leaving you're dead
to me already. So my question -- sorry, this isn't a stand up. My
questions are for Javier and Luis.

So for Luis, actually, I don't want to sound sycophantic, but is there
really much more you can do at Iberia? Clearly, some of that data on the
ASKs versus staff cuts. I suppose more directly, is there a Plan to
Futuro III? And might that deliver even more impressive performance from
Iberia?

And then on to Javier and Vueling, clearly, no growth next year, but I
think the chart shows there is some growth over the next few years. I
was wondering if you could just run us through these sort of underlying
performance. Clearly, Barcelona is difficult. Some of the routes you're
doing are difficult and really sort of the controllable performance in
terms of cost, in terms of, I suppose, Barcelona or outbound in
particular.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Okay. Well, I'll consider whether I'll let Luis
and Javier answer those questions. So I'm still in control here. But
maybe Javier --- yes. So if you want to come up here towards the front,
while Luis just addresses the Iberia issues for us. Luis, you go first.

LUIS GALLEGO MARTÃ­N: I go first? Okay. Talking about Iberia, you know
that our transformation is based on the Plan de Futuro. I plan to give
precisely that, a future to the company. We have organized the plan in
several phases. The first one was more related with labor issues,
productivity. We saw before the reduction in head count and the
productivity that we have achieved during this year. The second part was
most based in suppliers, what we can do with the platform of the group.
And this first phase of the Plan de Futuro that we are developing right
now is more ways in the digital transformation of the company,
innovations and other things that we can do to reach the excellence,
that is the name that we have given to this phase.

So we are sure that even in this competitive environment that we have
right now because as you know, some of the markets that we are flying,
like Argentina and others in South America, are not in the best
situation right now. We are pretty sure that with all the initiatives we
are putting together in a new plan, we are going to continue with this
performance of the company over the last year.

JAVIER SANCHEZ-PRIETO, VUELING CHAIRMAN & CEO, INTERNATIONAL
CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES GROUP, S.A.: Okay. And the question of Vueling not
growing next year and the reduced growth for the following years. I
would say, well, first of all, that's something that we're seeing. So we
are seeing our competitors also flexing down and being cautious in front
of the sometimes challenging circumstances inside of the markets. In
particular, some of our bigger competitor in Spain, they have announced
also that they will be not growing, even flexing down like 1% in Spain.

Having said that, it doesn't mean that we are not continuing building
leadership positions. So a 0 growth doesn't mean that we are not, let me
put a way, growing in some of our spots. We are being cautious in some
others, but we are growing in some of the places where we feel that we
can have accretive profit growth.

The other thing I would highlight is that the companies -- I mean we do
have flexibility. I mean we have proved this year that we are able to
flex down capacity in a very agile way. I think that we -- our fixed
cost is not big. So we've been able to manage that without, let's say,
without -- so bringing down also and stripping down the cost. And it
doesn't mean that we don't have the ability also to flex that up if we
feel that we see good opportunities. And that's something that could
happen eventually, that we can see good opportunities in the market, and
then we can flex up, if that is the case.

STEPHEN FURLONG, TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS ANALYST, DAVY, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Stephen Furlong from Davy. Just wanted to ask about brands.
Willie alluded to it on the Air Europa comments. But can you actually
have too many brands? I mean there was Air France for -- I accept
they're coming from a distant starting point, but -- and is simplifying
the number of brands they have and -- because you also talk about
world's leading brands, and you could have too many in -- perhaps in my
opinion. Maybe just the other thing, what would be kind of keep you up
at night in terms of anything that you see as kind of a negative thing
that could happen just in terms of either too much regulation or issues
with competition or authorities or anything in the industry going
forward?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Thanks, Stephen. Yes. I think our assessment is,
yes, we could have too many brands. And I don't think the situation that
we see developing if we're successful with Air Europa, which we believe
we will be. In Spain, we would then have Iberia, Iberia Express, Air
Europa, Vueling and LEVEL. And then we have Aer Lingus, BA operating
there as well. So -- but if I look at just within Spain, 5 brands, I
think that could lead to confusion.

Now there's good reason to have all of those at this stage, but I think
that's historical. That's looking backwards. I think going forward, we
see that, that needs to be rationalized. So we're conscious of the fact
that we need to have strong global brands that are well recognized,
positioned in the right segment, the demand space, as you've seen from
Alistair's presentation, and we believe we can do that. Too many of
them, I think, is going to create some confusion.

In terms of sleep -- I tell you, I sleep really well. And having seen
the presentation and knowing what the team can do, will do and are
confident about doing it in the future, I really do believe that this is
a business that's in a great position. I look at where we were, the
transition to where we've got to today and what we can do in the future,
and it is exciting. I said this a couple of years ago that I thought
this was going to be the most exciting period in aviation. And you look
at all the challenges that we faced in recent years, and we've come
through those really strongly. When a lot of others have either fallen
completely or have deteriorated in terms of their performance, our
performance has continued to improve.

Yes, we have some challenges, but I'm absolutely convinced with the
talent we have in the business, with the structures we have, with the
preparation that we've done, we're well positioned to deal with
anything.

On the issue of the environment, I hope you get the clear and strong
message. We are totally committed to doing what's right to ensure we
have a sustainable business. We've been doing a lot historically. We're
going to do it even better, and we will get challenged. The Panorama
program, I'm sure, will sound fantastic for some people. But it's
interesting, I was just looking -- BBC has a measure of efficiency that
they use. They -- I think of this right. I think they do tonnes of CO2
per pound of revenue, and they're currently aiming to get to something
15. We're 10,000 times more efficient on that metric than the BBC.

Now I don't think they're going to mention that when they talk about
tankering. But we actually do a lot of things really, really well. And
when you look at the metrics, we're -- we are very efficient, and we're
getting more efficient. And not just us, I think the industry is very
good. What we've got to do is make sure people understand that. But more
importantly, I think as an industry, we've got to recognize that there's
a hell of a lot more work we need to do to ensure that we can continue
to do what we've done into the future. And some of the things we've
done, including tankering, may not make sense from it, but I can be -- I
think, be clear with you, it doesn't make sense from an environmental
point of view.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Damian?

DAMIAN BREWER, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Damian
Brewer, RBC. First, can I touch on Steve's presentation? In particular,
you laid out the path for the cash machine with the long-term reduction
in CapEx, long-term reduction in pension payments. But as you think
about the short-term capital allocation, clearly, your inorganic
opportunities don't come on, on a regular basis. But when they do, they
potentially offer you that 15% return. And if we're in a softer
environment, clearly, there's more M&A opportunities potentially coming.

How do you or how is the Board starting to think of the trade-off
between the short-term benefits of things like share buybacks and
special dividends versus the long-term return on preserving capital? So
you've got the balance sheet to take potentially large opportunities
when they come. Because at the end of the day, 15% on investment is
better than 0% on cash.

And then the second question, again, kind of coming to that. Bond yields
continue to be down. There's indications we might see further
reductions. And yet, we're not really seeing reductions in the kind of
prices you're paying for infrastructure. How can you actually sort of
move that debate forward and make what you're paying, not just here at
Heathrow, but in Spain and other facilities start to reflect the
environment we live in?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Okay. Well, on the second one, I'll ask Sean to
make a comment because we've actually seen some success in relation to
that with Dublin. As you may know, the Commission for Aviation
regulation in Ireland has just issued its final determination in
relation to passenger charges for Dublin Airport, which is regulated.
And that argument was made and made very well. Sean, do you want to
speak to the highlights?

SEAN LIAM DOYLE, CEO & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AER LINGUS, INTERNATIONAL
CONSOLIDATED AIRLINES GROUP, S.A.: Yes. Well, thanks, Willie. In
relation to airport charges to Dublin Airport, they've fallen to about
[7 50] versus [9 18] today. And probably the key driver down of the
charges was the reduction in the weighted average cost of capital. And
it was 5.8%, in the last determination is now down to 4.2%. I think
that's a phenomenon that we see happening across airports more broadly,
and we're ensuring that in regulated airports that we mandate, that,
that efficiency gets passed through.

And at the same time, we've seen the infrastructure actually being
deemed to be affordable in that context. So we're quite encouraged by
that development.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: So you're absolutely right to highlight this, and
it's one of the areas that we're very much focused on because I think
this is an area where airports, in particular, have done exceptionally
well in the past. And we need to see better regulation. But I'm pleased
to say, I think we are seeing some evidence of that now. Steve, do you
want to...

STEPHEN WILLIAM LAWRENCE GUNNING: Yes. I'm slightly cautious in
responding to that because as I touched on earlier, it's a debate that's
ongoing within the business. But a couple of thoughts. One is, in some
ways, the structure that we have at the moment in terms of cash return,
in terms of a sustainable dividend, and then if we deem that there's
excess cash then to do something with that gives you that flexibility.

I think the 1.8, as I touched on, would be our typical ceiling. But if
there was an opportunity that meant temporarily that you needed to go
above that, then we would consider that. We went through some of those
thought processes when we were looking at Norwegian.

So it's an ongoing debate. It's absolutely fair observation and input. I
think you're going to have to wait until the full year results before I
give any more insights on that.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: I think the one thing we would say about
consolidation is the best form of consolidation is when the weak
disappear. And we're seeing that here, and I think Alistair demonstrated
that in his presentation.

In the past, where weak airlines were able to convince somebody to
acquire them, we're not seeing that anymore. And we're very clear on
that. I can assure you, we guess, I don't know Alistair would -- could
tell you here some of the names. I keep telling them, don't tell me
because I'm not interested. But everybody is phoning Alistair to say,
we'd love you to acquire us. We can quickly look at this and say,
there's no sustainable future for these airlines. Where we see those
opportunities, we will pursue them, but we're not going to pursue weak
airlines that can't demonstrate a sustainable path to achieving the
targets that we have.

So I think you're right, there will be a lot of opportunity. But I think
most of the opportunity that's going to come in the next couple of years
will be weak, inefficient, subscale airlines disappearing, and you won't
see people standing by to try and invest in them to keep them going.

There may be some exceptions to that. I will tell you there's always an
exception to the rule, but we'll -- we firmly believe that now is the
time to stand back and let the weak fail and let them disappear.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Savi?

SAVANTHI NIPUNIKA SYTH, AIRLINES ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES,
INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Savi Syth from Raymond James. Just 2 maybe
shorter questions. One on LEVEL, just you had some time to kind of
expand LEVEL here. You've seen a lot of kind of this long-haul, low-cost
model not work out at other carriers. And just wanted to get your
updated thoughts on LEVEL's future and how that's incorporated in the
organization.

And then the short question I had, actually, was on Aer Lingus. The
margin for Aer Lingus kind of in the target came down. I thought that
was a little curious given how well Aer Lingus has been performing and
just kind of wondering what was behind that?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Yes. I think I'll let Sean comment on that, but
it has come down, but it's still at an exceptionally high level. So I
think we did point out in terms of return on invested capital that Aer
Lingus had a significant benefit from some very capital-efficient
aircraft that would need to be replaced. But Sean?

SEAN LIAM DOYLE: Yes. I think the Aer Lingus margins, I think, are still
industry-leading because we'll be in the 13% to 15% range and probably
at the top quartile of the group. So I think operating margin is, again,
very healthy, and we're committed to sustain it at that level. I think
ROIC was 26% last year. I think some of that is probably a degree of a
capital holiday on short haul, in particular. I think even with a
refleeting plan that would kick in over the next 5 years, we're in the
range of 22%, 23%. So again, I think our ROIC is in very, very good
health.

I think the other thing, which is happening, of course, is we've been
transforming from being more short haul to more long haul, and we do see
more sustainable returns and great performance on the long haul
business. So I think by any measure, the Aer Lingus metrics are in
pretty good health. But ROIC is moderating to something, which is,
again, above average, but probably more representative, sustainable
through the cycle.

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Fernando Candela is here. I'm not going to call
on him to comment because he's only had the role of CEO at LEVEL for a
very short period of time. But just to say what we have seen there is
that we still believe in this business model. It is a model that is
highly dependent on low cost and having the ability to stimulate new
markets through price. It has been performing in line with expectation
in some markets. We were having an excellent performance from Barcelona
to Buenos Aires until the currency was devalued. So that has clearly
impacted on the short-term profitability because we were operating --
we're at about 70% point-of-sale from Argentina. So when you've seen the
devaluation of the peso, that's clearly impacted on the -- when we
translate that into euro profitability.

France was a little bit behind the competitive landscape, and Paris was
worse than we thought it would be and didn't shake out as fast as we
thought it would, but that's happening now with the -- you've seen Aigle
Azur has failed and XL has failed. They lasted a bit longer than we
thought, but they're gone. And going back to what I said earlier,
nobody's stepping in to recover them. So they're out of the market. That
rationalizes the capacity.

But what we were seeing in France, and I think it's supported by some of
the things that Javier was saying, the market wasn't being stimulated as
much as we had expected it through price, but I think that was specific
to Paris.

So in the main, we see the model working, but it's been challenged by
short-term issues that have impacted on currency in Argentina and by
some capacity issues in France. But Fernando, I'm sure will be delighted
to present at next capital markets, and I'll commit him to doing that
and for future years as well after I've gone.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Jarrod?

JARROD CASTLE, MD, HEAD OF THE TRAVEL & LEISURE SECTOR AND CO-HEAD OF
THE GLOBAL TRANSPORT SECTOR TEAM, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH
DIVISION: It's Jarrod Castle from UBS. No Capital Markets Day would be
complete without the third runway. So do you want to give a bit of an
update in terms of kind of, has there been a narrowing of views between
where you stand and Heathrow?

And then also, just on the back end of the fleet program, if there was a
third runway, how we should think about this? And then, just secondly,
just on LEVEL, I mean, you kind of showed on Slide 151 the current
operating companies and some of the targets in terms of ROIC margin.
You've given the capacity for LEVEL, but do you think we'll get to a
stage where you show ROIC and margin for LEVEL?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: On the third runway, yes, I remain very clear
that if it can be built in a cost-effective manner, then it would be
good. I have 0 confidence that Heathrow can build this in a
cost-effective manner. I think all of the stuff we've heard recently
about Virgin is complete -- yes. Yes. The company -- you look at Virgin,
their profitability, nonexistent. The balance sheet, nonexistent. And
the idea that they're going to be able to grow the business to sustain
the slots that they say that they want, it just doesn't add up.

Quite honestly, nothing in relation to the third runway adds up when you
look at this on a cold -- analysis of the cost. So if it happens, I'd be
surprised. I think the challenges are getting greater and greater. It's
absolutely clear that Heathrow, as a company cannot build the third
runway anywhere close to the price guarantees that they've given. They
can't even get close to it. And the environmental challenges are much
greater today than they have been.

So I think we're looking at a situation where political support for it
will be questionable. Environmental support for it would be 0, and
financial support for it, I think, is extremely difficult and waning by
the day.

So I had said 50-50 in the most recent interview I did. I can't see the
odds being any better than that, and probably the odds are declining
that Heathrow will be built -- or the third runway will be built. If it
is, we're now -- I'm standing in the middle of the taxiway. You're
sitting, watching me been overtaken by an airplane, but it comes right
through here, so this building will be gone, which will be another
reason why we won't be holding Capital Markets Day here.

On LEVEL, yes, I think we believe we can get to the margins. And if we
can't, we'll be honest with you, and we say we've looked. We've tried.
We failed and will stop it. But we remain committed, and we remain
convinced that there is a profitable segment that is not properly served
at the moment. It is limited in terms of its size, but there is a
profitable segment that we believe we can operate in, and we can
generate margins and achieve the targets that we've set for the other
airlines in the group. If we can't, we won't do it.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Jaime?

JAIME BANN ROWBOTHAM, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Jaime Rowbotham from Deutsche Bank. Two questions. One for
Willie on sustainability, and one for Steve on free cash.

Willie, on sustainability, Part 4 of the path to net 0 emissions by 2050
was a lot of the areas like CORSIA, which are going to cost IAG. Do you
take a sort of optimistic view at all on your customers footing any of
the bill there by offsetting their own emissions? Or do you take a more
bearish view that the costs will all lie with IAG?

And linked to that, you talked about having to do things differently,
and it just struck me, we've heard a lot about loyalty today that things
like 50p fares to go to Amsterdam, and I know people will have done a
lot of hard graft earning the Avios and -- required to go with it. But
fares like that might strike people as slightly controversial in a world
where we're trying to encourage less emissions. So do you think loyalty
might have to change at all or Avios alongside sustainability?

And then, Steve, on the free cash, obviously, the move to guiding on
levered free cash flow is very welcome. Just to make sure I've
understood the point. When you guide to EUR 2.1 billion on average, it
would be a lot easier to get there if you did sale and leaseback on all
your aircraft versus on none. So is the working assumption still 50-50
like it was before? Or has that changed?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: So on sustainability, we see some evidence of
customers wanting to do this themselves. And in fact, it's clear that
particularly with corporate travel, a number of our corporates are
already doing it. I think when they see what we're doing -- and I think
this is where, again, we want better engagement with our corporate, so
they can understand if we've already done the offsetting, they don't
need to do it. Or if they want to do it, and in some cases, they do
because they want to be able to report that they're doing it, then we're
not double counting.

But there is definitely some appetite for that. But I think what's more
important is that we accept responsibility for it, and we start taking
the measures to ensure that everybody is covered.

So looking forward, we believe that you've got to price carbon into
everything you do. And the EU ETS, I think a tonne of carbon today is
about EUR 25 per tonne. That's much higher than it was a few years ago.
It's probably -- well, it will get higher still. And as Steve said,
we're factoring that into our plans. So in everything we're doing, we're
pricing carbon in there. Carbon will be more expensive going forward. It
has to be. And therefore, we're looking at this in the context of just
blending it into the oil price.

And importantly, we've demonstrated -- we've seen the charts there. We
were growing our profitability as the oil price was increasing. So this
is an industry that can be profitable in a high oil price and whether
that's a blended oil carbon price environment, and that's why we're
comfortable that we can do both. We can be financially sustainable and
environmentally sustainable.

You've asked a great question. Is there a disconnect between loyalty and
what we're doing on sustainability? I don't believe there is because
what you've got to remember is that in many cases, what we're trying to
do here is we're trying to fill these seats that otherwise would be
empty, and that leads to the incremental cost of carriage in terms of
incremental fuel burn and incremental CO2.

So if you take that flight I did to Toronto, the basic weight of that
aircraft before we put the payload on board, from memory, was about 152
tonnes. So we then had 39 tonnes of payload. So you're actually burning
fuel just to fly the aircraft empty. That -- with just the crew and the
seats, you're burning fuel to do that. The more seats you fill, the more
efficient from an energy intensity point of view it is. So I looked at
it, we had 26 empty seats. The incremental fuel burn for those 26 seats
would have come to about 410 kilos of fuel for the flight. And that
would have translated into 50 kilograms of CO2 per passenger if all of
those seats were filled.

So we're looking at it in terms of the incremental CO2 being produced.
And what we see there, is there is -- there's no disconnect between what
it is we're trying to do. And in many cases, as Drew pointed out, these
points are being redeemed by people who are flying. It's just that they
can now fly for a cheaper price because we're using part cash and Avios.
But even the fares that Drew was showing you there, it's looking at
what's the incremental fuel burn associated with carrying those
passengers given that the seats, had they not done it, were probably
going to be empty. And you know what, our seat factors are around, what,
86%, 87%. So we still got a lot of empty seats on the aircraft.

And that's where the industry has been criticized. And that's where we
were poor in the past. You think, historically, seat factors were in the
70s, low 70s, in fact. So you're flying this aircraft around with a lot
of empty seats because flying was the -- was only available to the
privileged few, the rich. It wasn't available to everybody. So we've got
to be more and more efficient.

And this is an opportunity for us to increase our seat factors to ensure
that those seats don't go empty, and that people can look at their
loyalty. And yes, recognizing that it does generate an incremental fuel
burn and an incremental CO2 and ensuring that we then have, in the
scenario that we've pointed out, schemes that will offset that or where
we're already paying for that, so that we can wrap this all together and
make a coherent and consistent story around everything it is that we're
doing. And if we see a disconnect, then we'll address it. But we don't
see one in relation to this. And we have debated this one quite a bit,
and we will continue to debate it to ensure that we're doing things that
are sensible.

STEPHEN WILLIAM LAWRENCE GUNNING: So on the free cash flow, a few
thoughts on that. I did an exercise to look at the -- does the financing
shape look different in this plan versus the last plan? It's broadly the
same at the moment. So that should give you some comfort.

I wanted to put the principles up there because I think we should be
making the right economic decisions. Interestingly enough, one of the
challenges with using net CapEx and then equity free cash flow, the way
that we've defined it in the past, was it actually prejudiced against,
say, things like JOLCOs, et cetera. And so I wanted it to be a more
level playing field across the board.

So particularly, if you've got a -- if you've got, I don't know, 7779X,
I think that will be a sort of spine of the fleet for a long, long time,
an aircraft like that, I'd want people to be thinking about, should that
be a JOLCO, we're going to be having this aircraft for 20-plus years, so
we should be. Otherwise, we shouldn't be buying them.

The way we've structured those metrics now will make that an easier
decision for a CFO or the treasury team or myself. So there's not a
radical change underneath. I think it's better to have proper guiding
principles. Actually, I think it will create better decisions, what
we've done.

MALTE CHRISTOPH SCHULZ, EQUITY ANALYST OF INDUSTRIALS, COMMERZBANK AG,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Malte Schulz from Commerzbank . Two questions here,
very short. I mean you still have multiple loyalty programs, probably
the only airline group, which still has or runs multiple ones. What's
the rationale of particularly having an own for Iberia and Aer Lingus
and British Airways, instead of having one, which promotes the IAG brand
as well?

And the second one, particularly, if you look at multiple brands in
Madrid. How would you think that it would be a rationale to even put it
on the long haul to kind of, I believe, semi-premium brands, if you
would put also Air Europa and then kind of mix at least or closer to a
premium brand? And particularly, if you want to fly to other areas like
Africa or Asia more, wouldn't it then be rational to have just one big
hub brand?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Drew, do you want to deal with the loyalty?

ANDREW CRAWLEY: Yes. Sure. Single program. That's a topic that's come
up. I think that there is no rationale to not have a single platform,
and that's what we're in the middle of doing now. So we're moving all
the tech from the disparate programs all onto the same platform so that
when we've done that, we have optionality to choose whether we want a
single program or not.

I think the big debate is what value do the brands in their home market
bring that might be diluted down if it was called something different.
So if you look at all the hotel companies, the Bonvoy, the Hilton Honors
and IHG Rewards, the difference between hotels and us is that we have a
center of gravity where large numbers of customers are around our main
hubs and our home markets, and that's where the value of the home
airline brands really adds significant value.

So if we are going to move to a single program, I think we need to work
out the answer to that question about how you blend the brands into that
program so that you don't lose out what is in shorthand. In the U.K.,
people think of the BA Exec Club and you would lose that if you went to
a single program. What could replace it that would be better? Does that
make sense?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: On the airline -- thanks, Drew. On the airline
brands, we're very clear. All the research we've done, and we've done
quite a lot of research in this area, tells us that a dual brand
strategy at a hub like Madrid is actually the most effective way forward
given that we see different demand spaces, as Alistair presented. And we
think you get greater clarity around what the brand stands for.

We've seen in the past that -- take BA, as an example, and Alex has
talked about this previously, trying to compete or be competitive and
attractive in every segment just dilutes the value of the brand. You've
got to be clear in terms of what your brand stands for, what your
customer proposition is, and then deliver consistently to that. And we
think in a hub like Madrid, there is scope for a dual brand,
particularly with the network as we see it developing going forward.

So having 5 brands, we think, is -- that's too much. But a dual brand,
we think, is absolutely right in the long haul segment. We will do a lot
of research. That's the advantage in having some time here to assess the
positioning of the brands and the performance of the brands before we
decide on what it is we're going to do in terms of rationalizing brands.
But it is clear to us that we will have to rationalize the number of
brands that we have operating in the Spanish market when we go forward.
But we've got time to address that.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Alex?

ALEXANDER PATERSON, ANALYST, PEEL HUNT LLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Alex
Paterson from Peel Hunt. Two for me as well, please. Firstly, just on
the fuel savings. Clearly, you're investing in more fuel-efficient fleet
as are some of your -- in fact, nearly all of your competitors and
peers. Do you expect to retain all those savings from that? Or do you
think they will be shared with customers?

And secondly, just regarding the dividend. Looking at your levered free
cash flow to the cost of your dividend it's getting on for 4x, you're
looking at 10% or more earnings growth in the next few years, but your
dividend was flat at the interim stage. Should we think about dividend
perhaps being flat in years where your profits are flat or down and
growing to match the earnings growth when you have upside?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: On the fuel savings, I think it's important to
point out that, yes, our competitors are investing. We're going to get a
greater step change. So part of -- going back to what I said, because we
took a conscious decision not to skip a generation, but to not commit
fully to a generation of aircraft, recognizing that there was another
generation of aircraft that would be even more fuel-efficient coming
along, we'll get a bigger step change in the fuel-saving than our
competitors.

So history would tell you that some of this will definitely be passed on
to the customer, but we believe that given the position that we're in,
that we will retain an element of that, that our competitors won't be
able to retain. And that's why I think there is a tailwind for us in
relation to the fuel benefit, as Steve presented in his chart.

On the dividend, Steve mentioned and he can comment now as well. We're
going to do a lot more work on this. We've had great engagement with the
board. We've had some very constructive dialogue. That needs to continue
because we have had some significant change, as Steve said in his
presentation, with regard to the pension, and that gives us greater
flexibility going forward. So the interim dividend was, if you like,
under the old rules. I think going forward, we want to assess the
situation under the new environment. And the new environment, as you'll
have seen from Steve's presentation, is different to where we've been in
the past.

STEPHEN WILLIAM LAWRENCE GUNNING: Nothing to add to that, really. I'd
refer you to my answer to Damian. It's a discussion that's ongoing.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Gerald?

GERALD NICHOLAS KHOO, TRANSPORT ANALYST, LIBERUM CAPITAL LIMITED,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Gerald Khoo from Liberum. Can I ask a few questions
about alliances. I think in the past, you've been very clear about the
value that joint ventures bring, but do alliances still have material
value to you? Obviously, there's been some disruption with LATAM looking
to leave oneworld. And I think all is not necessarily peaceful within
oneworld.

So what value do they bring? Do they still -- are they still the future?
And do you see any value in the strategy that Delta's pursuing in terms
of investment in other airlines, equity stakes? And finally, can you
remind us what the situation is with Aer Lingus and the transatlantic
joint business? Has there been any progress there, please?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: Okay. Alliances -- I've been very clear. I think
alliances are a poor substitute for genuine M&A activity. But given some
of the restrictions that apply in our industry, they exist. They're all
about revenue synergies. Anybody who tells you that there's a cost
benefit or any cost synergy, they're misleading you.

So yes, there is a role to play. I think if there was an alternative,
people will pursue it. I think the structure of the alliances, I've
always said, the structure is fragile, and we have seen people leave one
and join another. So that's going to continue. But there is a role for
them to play in the current environment, and I expect that to continue.
But will it change, I have absolutely no doubt that it will. And I don't
think LATAM leaving oneworld is the end of that.

Do -- I give some credit to Delta. We've talked about this before, and
I've often debated this with investors. If we see that we can generate
strategic value by taking a minority stake in another airline, then we
would have to consider it. But taking a minority stake without having
some form of control or some influence over what the airline is going to
do has no value whatsoever because you may as well do that. So you can
invest if you want to. The idea that I would pay a premium to invest on
your behalf and get nothing in relation to control back for that premium
just doesn't make sense.

So if Delta can genuinely exercise control through their minority
investments, then I think that is a sensible way forward. Now they've
done that in relation to Virgin, but it's a minority investment on paper
only. As everybody knows, it's actually -- they control the airline, but
they effectively -- own it as well. They've done so -- pretty well with
Aeromexico. I wait to see what influence they will exert over LATAM with
a 20% stake, given some of the other investors there as well.

So I give them credit because I think they do deserve credit for some of
the things they do, but we only see that making sense where you get an
element of control. If you can't get control or influence, then you're
like Etihad. You think you have control. They take your money. They
spend it, and then they tell you to get lost. We're not going to do
that.

On Aer Lingus, the process is ongoing. So we're working with the U.S.
authorities. So as you know, we've no control over the timing of that,
but we continue to work with the regulators to seek approval to bring
Aer Lingus into the joint -- transatlantic joint business.

ANDREW JAMES LIGHT: Okay. Last question?

OLFA TAAMALLAH, ANALYST, ODDO BHF CORPORATE & MARKETS, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Olfa Taamallah from ODDO BHF. So my question is around the
short term, maybe, Q4 and Q1. Just wondering in the context of -- given
the uncertainties, again, around the Brexit, no clear timetable and the
ongoing election, how you are doing today in managing the change in
demand dynamics? And what are the action implemented in order to
safeguard the pricing?

WILLIAM MATTHEW WALSH: So in relation to -- I didn't quite hear, but in
relation to Brexit -- look, we're digging into our figures all the time
to see, can we identify a Brexit impact in anything that we're seeing.
And quite honestly, we can't. Now I know some of our competitors have
said they see a Brexit impact. We genuinely cannot see anything that we
can directly relate to Brexit. The one thing that I think is directly
related to Brexit is U.K. GDP, and you've seen the forecast for next
year, depending on who you listen to, is a bit softer, still growing,
but U.K. GDP growth. And ultimately, we do see U.K. GDP impacting on
everybody.

But what's important to highlight, and I think is different for us, is
we're really more dependent on London and the London economy rather than
the U.K. economy. And I think that's why some of our competitors have
seen an impact that we haven't seen because they're more exposed to the
rest of the U.K. outside of London. And the London economy is a
different economy to the U.K. economy in general.

So we're not seeing any impact. We can't identify any negatives in any
trends, customer behavior, corporate behavior. Everything that we're
witnessing at the moment is in line with what we would expect it to be
and nothing that we can associate directly with Brexit.

So given that we've gone through quite a period of uncertainty in
relation to Brexit, we don't see that changing going forward. And the
political environment is the political environment. We just get on and
run the business. And we adapt, and we continue to improve regardless of
who's out there challenging us. So we're confident that -- if you like,
the worst of Brexit we've seen already and the uncertainty associated
with it is embedded in the business, but we can't see anything that we
can say, "this is impacting on our bookings" because there's nothing
there. So nothing in the fourth quarter, as we said when we did the
third quarter results.

I think that's it because I know there's foods, lunch available for you,
and the carbon associated with us has been factored into offsetting. Can
I just thank you, again? Appreciate so many of you coming along to hear
what it is we've had to say.

Obviously, a lot of information has been made available to you, and I
know those of you who want to follow up on that will contact Andrew and
the team over the coming weeks. We look forward to talking to you when
we release our full year results in, I think, the end of February of
next year. So thank you very much.

Kerala Techie Quits Job, Now Farms 550 Exotic Fruits From Across The
World!

19 May -- After a string of failures with his startup ideas, William
Mathews, an MCA graduate from Kappatumala, a village in Kozhikode,
decided to move to the UAE.

But in 2010, William left his job there, returned to Kerala and went on
to establish a 'fruitful career' (pun intended) there.

In a span of 10 years, this techie has filled 8 acres of his land with
550 varieties of tropical fruits and also diversified into coconut
cultivation, pisciculture and apiculture.

Today William's 'Infarm' fruit farm is immensely popular in Kerala and a
must-visit place for researchers and agricultural experts from across
the country.

"I gave up my job in the UAE because there was absolutely no growth, and
returned with the dream of developing a fruit farm. I thought that it
would be a hobby but it has become a great business model and generates
a lot of money," explains the 42-year-old.

Kerala's Very Own Amazon 

William's orchard is home to over 30 varieties of lemons, 19 varieties
of dates, 7 varieties of guava and 8 varieties of passion fruit besides
exotic fruits like the American Coconia, the "mickey mouse fruit," wax
apples, the Himalayan mulberry, Rollinia, and the Brazilian jaboticaba,
from around the world. There are also hyper-local fruits such as 'Mooti
pazham,' 'Njara pazham and 'Karapazham.'

Williams bought the saplings of these trees which were worth Rs 500 back
in 2010. Today their cost ranges from Rs 1000 to 2000.

He also converted family-owned paddy fields into mangosteen orchards
which are part of his fruit farm.

"Fruit forests or fruit farms are a very popular concept outside India
but have not been experimented on a large scale in the country so far. I
feel that it is definitely something that the states in the Western
Ghats should try out because the humid climate in these areas is apt for
them," he adds.

Besides the fruits, the farm also has a few medicinal plants like
frankincense, camphor and rudraksha.

William has also recently expanded into apiculture and pisciculture. The
farm currently has 2 ponds with different varieties of fish and almost
100 boxes of honeybees for cultivation.

"This farm didn't pop up overnight. I've done a lot of research and
travelled to several farms across India and abroad to get a better
understanding of how it's done. Most of these saplings cost a fortune
and at that time since I was struggling financially, my parents advised
me not to invest in farming. But every time I found a tropical fruit
that was rare and could be grown in Kerala's climatic conditions, I
would purchase it immediately. Today when I look back, I'm glad I took
those decisions because I can finally see my dreams coming true,"
explains William.

Stepping StonesAs mentioned earlier, before the farm, William had
experienced a series of failures.

"Right after my graduation in 1996 from Rajagiri, I had a plan for a
startup called 'Status Idea' which is similar to today's 'Facebook.' The
application would allow people to connect with their friends and
colleagues in real-time. But my timing was all wrong. India was not
familiar with the concept of a startup at the time and I failed
miserably," explains William.

Promotion

While his focus was on the farm, to ensure that his skills in IT would
not go to waste, he started a skilling centre named Mavoor Institution
of Computer Technology (MICT) which would teach students the basic
concepts of IT, coding and technicalities of operating a computer.
Today, with almost 60 students attending the classes, it has also begun
to gain momentum.

"My wife Seena is currently heading MICT and my children Joshua and
Joel, who study in Classes 8 and 9, respectively, help me out with the
work in the farm. Both of them have developed a passion for farming and
I'm glad they understood its value at such a young age, says William.

"I believe that every household should plant vegetable and fruit
saplings according to the space they have. This will never go into waste
and you will soon be able to use the produce from your own backyard,"
William concludes.

William is one of the many people who switched careers from the IT world
to farming with an aim to create a diverse 'fruit forest' and make these
tropical fruits accessible to others. At a time when farmers are
quitting agriculture, people like William gives us hope for a greener
future.

farm currently has 2 ponds with different varieties of fish and almost
100 boxes of honeybees for cultivation.

"This farm didn't pop up overnight. I've done a lot of research and
travelled to several farms across India and abroad to get a better
understanding of how it's done. Most of these saplings cost a fortune
and at that time since I was struggling financially, my parents advised
me not to invest in farming. But every time I found a tropical fruit
that was rare and could be grown in Kerala's climatic conditions, I
would purchase it immediately. Today when I look back, I'm glad I took
those decisions because I can finally see my dreams coming true,"
explains William.

Stepping StonesAs mentioned earlier, before the farm, William had
experienced a series of failures.

"Right after my graduation in 1996 from Rajagiri, I had a plan for a
startup called 'Status Idea' which is similar to today's 'Facebook.' The
application would allow people to connect with their friends and
colleagues in real-time. But my timing was all wrong. India was not
familiar with the concept of a startup at the time and I failed
miserably," explains William.

While his focus was on the farm, to ensure that his skills in IT would
not go to waste, he started a skilling centre named Mavoor Institution
of Computer Technology (MICT) which would teach students the basic
concepts of IT, coding and technicalities of operating a computer.
Today, with almost 60 students attending the classes, it has also begun
to gain momentum.

"My wife Seena is currently heading MICT and my children Joshua and
Joel, who study in Classes 8 and 9, respectively, help me out with the
work in the farm. Both of them have developed a passion for farming and
I'm glad they understood its value at such a young age, says William.

"I believe that every household should plant vegetable and fruit
saplings according to the space they have. This will never go into waste
and you will soon be able to use the produce from your own backyard,"
William concludes.

William is one of the many people who switched careers from the IT world
to farming with an aim to create a diverse 'fruit forest' and make these
tropical fruits accessible to others. At a time when farmers are
quitting agriculture, people like William gives us hope for a greener
future.
