03/03 Links Pt2: Meet the brilliant barrister battling lies about
Israel; Filmmaker Steven Spielberg Says Global Antisemitism is 'Standing
Proud,' 'No Longer Lurking'

From Ian:

A Second Purim Story[1] The application of age-old archetypes hasn't
disappeared: Many people consider Hitler to have been of an Amalekite
strain. But even if we draw metaphorical language from the canon, we are
not imagining ourselves within it the way medieval Jewry did.

When Haman slandered the Jewish people to King Ahasuerus, he described
them as 'a certain people scattered and separate among the nations.'
Medieval Jewry may have been geographically scattered and forcibly
separated from interacting with the gentile world due to antisemitic
laws, but within their own locales, they were not separated from one
another. Today, we are more universalized than ever before—constantly
updated on every news event happening halfway across the globe—but we
are mentally scattered, emotionally removed, superficially scrolling.
While human instinct demands that we bond briefly over tragedies, our
Jewish community requires much deeper coalitions to celebrate averted
ones.

The original Purim story famously makes no mention of God, which many
interpret as a sign that diasporic Jews must pull themselves up by their
bootstraps to find the divine in the darkness. In Megillat Saragossa,
however, God's name appears multiple times. The text insists that the
Jews of Saragossa are God-fearing and God-following. More importantly,
these mentions of a divine presence assure its audience—Jews of
Saragossa and their descendants—that God has not abandoned them.

The two Purims don't coincide on the Hebrew calendar: The Saragossa
Purim falls on the 17th of Shevat, almost a month before Purim, which
falls on the 14th of Adar. But all the mitzvot of the original Purim are
fulfilled on the Second Purim as well: megillah reading, feasting,
gifting mishloach manot, and giving charity. Some people even fast the
day before. Scholars report that the Purim of Saragossa was celebrated
in several Balkan communities into the 20th century and lasted for the
longest time in Jerusalem. Most recently, in 2016, Albert Haim Samuel
bequeathed the Megillat Saragossa he had received from his devout
Izmirian grandmother Deborah—which is written on buckskin leather—to the
Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul. While the Samuel family had privately
celebrated the holiday for years, Chief Rabbi Ishak Haleva declared that
'as a [Turkish] community we would very much like to celebrate Purim
Saragossa every year.'

This year, on the 17th of Shevat (the eve of Feb. 7, 2023), cantor Isaac
Gantwerk Mayer performed a livestreamed reading of Megillat Saragossa on
YouTube. Hearing the words chanted in the familiar cantillation of
Megillat Esther brought the text to life in a way I had not anticipated.
It was like hearing past generations tell their own story through the
same song: Transcending time and space, the original Purim and the Purim
of Saragossa rhymed and overlapped, adding layers of nuance to an
already rich Jewish narrative.Meet the brilliant barrister battling lies
about Israel[2]Natasha Hausdorff's debut radio broadcast was during the
Israel-Gaza conflict in 2014.

She'd been invited onto Nick Ferrari's breakfast show on LBC to debate
Israel's military operation codenamed Protective Edge, and she left the
London studio determined to go on air again.

'It was a turning point. I was only 24 and a trainee solicitor, but I
was able to tell Nick things about the anti-Israel propaganda machine
that he had clearly never heard before. It felt good. Right.'

This Sunday, the 33-year-old barrister and legal director of UK Lawyers
for Israel will be making the country's case again at Jewish Book Week.

Hausdorff, who clerked for the late President of the Israeli Supreme
Court, Chief Justice Miriam Naor, is taking part in a roundtable
discussion entitled, 'Israel: A Fragile Democracy?' with JC columnist
Jonathan Freedland, fellow lawyer Anthony Julius and historian Sir Simon
Schama.

The exact remit of their conversation is still to be determined, she
says, but its general departure point is the new Israeli government's
planned changes to the judicial system: a proposal Supreme Court
president Esther Hayut has described as 'a plan to crush the justice
system', that opposition leader Yair Lapid has said is a 'struggle for
the soul of the country' — and which saw 80,000 Israelis take to the
streets in protest earlier this year.

Hausdorff, a specialist in international law, takes a more careful,
nuanced view. 'Look, the idea of reforming Israel's judicial system
shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone,' she says.

'The country doesn't have the written constitution that was envisaged at
its declaration of independence because immediately thereafter it had to
fight a war of survival, and people have been talking about reforming
the system for decades.

"When change is implemented, I hope it is with broad political input and
general common sense. But right now, the opposition in Israel is
encouraging protests and letters of concern from people around the world
who are commenting on the situation from an uninformed position. And
who, in some cases, have been very badly misinformed indeed."

Putting the 'badly misinformed' right, correcting the swathes of
untruths that surround the Jewish state, is a moral compulsion for
Hausdorff. And she felt the urge from an early
age.https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjFpVW8HgIJR_v--WQHkUCP8SbqcFtBEyo7MJzvmHFPAN9ZVHkiBcBq2RLiXgI1247O3a27Y4MW8O_WLcraP_XEYtpD8TQ9aciccCNE4odZ14VtXzVhtyFB2KPcFcj5Z7UZLf99ykPare1F92ZmP3uPn7SYnXNp2VdXTbq9hQ7dXryfrJ5Gw/s520/Fp-xJIpXsAEmDNs.jpg

Jonathan Tobin: Should American Jews intervene to stop Netanyahu?[3]When
the courts didn't protect the right to dissent The recent mass
demonstrations call to mind the last time a government used its Knesset
majority to legislate change that provoked mass dissent. Only that time,
the tables were turned.

From 1993 to 1995, the government led by the late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin pushed ahead with the implementation of the Oslo Accords,
empowering Yasser Arafat and the terrorist Palestine Liberation
Organization he led. Those who opposed that government used inflammatory
rhetoric and, yes, tried to block the highways.

At that time, Jewish Federations were not interested in the rights of
the minority or preserving Israeli democracy. Since they agreed with the
ruling Labor Party that Oslo was a triumph rather than the blood-soaked
disaster that it proved to be, they wholeheartedly endorsed it. And they
damned any dissenters in Israel or the United States as not merely wrong
but as enemies of democracy because Rabin had the votes in the Knesset
to do as he liked.

The Rabin government was even more contemptuous of its opponents than
Netanyahu is now and treated dissent as criminal. Those who had led
protests aimed at tying up the highways and attacks on the government
not dissimilar to what's happening in Israel today were charged and
ultimately convicted of 'sedition'—treasonous activity—in an outrageous
breach of democratic norms. Yet the Israeli Supreme Court, led by Barak,
didn't intervene on their behalf.

This is important—and not just because the lessons that were supposedly
drawn from this period of Israeli civil strife have generally been
considered to hold that toleration of extreme and violent rhetoric can
possibly lead to violent actions, such as Rabin's tragic and appalling
assassination by an extremist foe of his policies.

Rather, what should be gleaned from this sorry chapter of Israeli
history, as with other such examples since then, that contrary to the
claims that the current Israeli judicial system is a necessary check on
the power of the prime minister and the Knesset that preserves
democracy, in practice, it is nothing of the kind. It has merely been a
political weapon wielded by one side in the country's political wars.
The court consistently intervenes to stop the right from governing and
to preserve the rights of groups that oppose Netanyahu but has always
been happy to let the left crush its opponents when it is in power.
Whether or not you sympathized with Rabin or his critics (or now with
Netanyahu or his critics), that, too, isn't democracy.

American intervention won't help democracy Those parts of the pro-Israel
community, like AIPAC, who have stayed out of the maelstrom, are
demonstrating their understanding that the best way to preserve
democracy is to let the democratic process play out. That means letting
Israel's voters decide who governs as they did only four months ago when
they gave Netanyahu's coalition a clear majority. And then judging them
on their performance at the next election.

Jacobs's pretense that he is fighting for democracy doesn't stand up to
scrutiny. While those who have chosen the path of intervention in
Israeli politics are free to do so, they lack both the humility that
foreign observers should have in such situations and are, in this case,
merely acting as a cheering section for one side in a political dispute.
Their goal, as well as that of the leaders of the current protest, isn't
to preserve democracy but to topple Netanyahu—and to keep those who
represent right-wing and religious voters from exercising meaningful
power.

Just as important, by calling, as some have done, for the Biden
administration to use its considerable power to join this effort to undo
the last election, they are crossing a line that can lead only to
splintering the ties between the United States and Israel, as well as
between Israeli and American Jewry. In the process, they are also
lending credence to the smears of left-wing opponents of Israel who also
seek to deny that it is a democracy.

Those who love Israel must hope that ultimately reason prevails and that
enough of the reforms can be passed so as to restore democracy while
being done so in a way that will enable civil peace. That will mean
compromise, though not the mob actions and efforts to delegitimize
democratic opponents that Netanyahu's foes are employing. Americans who
want to assist that process of reconciliation will do well to speak with
some circumspection, rather than embodying the worst of the partisan
excesses that now characterize politics in both Washington and
Jerusalem.Mark Regev: US-Israel ties have gone from strength to strength
since 2001[4]IT WAS therefore understandable that Sharon's
Czechoslovakia comments would ignite a diplomatic firestorm. White House
spokesperson Ari Fleischer responded: 'The president believes that these
remarks are unacceptable. Israel could have no better or stronger friend
than the United States and no better friend than President Bush.'

Sharon realized he had gone too far in his Bush-Chamberlain analogy. Key
Jerusalem-based American correspondents received phone calls on October
7 from the prime minister: 'Unfortunately, the metaphor in my words was
not understood correctly, and I'm sorry about that.' The reporters,
having repeatedly seen interview requests turned down, were now
pleasantly surprised to find Sharon eager to talk.

The public apology ended the crisis, and as the optimists had initially
predicted, in the years after 9/11, US-Israel ties did indeed go from
strength to strength.

Postscript: In 1945-46, newly liberated Czechoslovakia expelled the
Sudeten Germans, and an estimated 2.5 million people were forcibly
transferred to Germany. The deportations were often harrowing and
sometimes violent, with thousands of deaths among those ousted.

Despite this 'ethnic cleansing,' Prague's post-war democratic leaders,
president Edvard Benes and foreign minister Jan Masaryk, remained
respected European statesmen. It was widely perceived that a domestic
national minority, which had collaborated with the hostile designs of an
aggressive neighbor to destroy the democratic state where it lived, was
only receiving just deserves.

It was not just the Sudeten Germans who were compelled to abandon their
homes. Following World War II, tens of millions across Europe, Asia and
the Middle East were forcibly displaced, including the Jews of the Arab
lands. Yet, for myriad reasons, it is the Palestinian refugee saga that
eclipses all others in receiving ongoing international attention.New
Leader of Italy's Main Left-Wing Party Raises Concern With Attacks on
Israel and Comments on Her Jewish Origins[5]In May 2021, during the war
between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Schlein issued a statement decrying
what she called the 'asymmetrical' nature of the conflict.

'In Gaza, there is an explosion of violence not since the intifada[s] of
the 1980s and 200s that is causing suffering and destruction, with many
children among the victims,' she wrote. 'But I read too many reports and
statements that do not understand that we are not facing a symmetrical
clash.'

Schlein went on to accuse Israel of the 'ethnic cleansing of
Palestinians from [Jerusalem neighborhood] Sheikh Jarrah and beyond,'
arguing that 'the balance of power is totally skewed in favor of
Israel.' She called for a solution that recognized 'the fundamental
rights of the Palestinian people by ending Israel's illegal settlements
and occupation.'

Schlein also drew criticism when she appeared at Palestinian solidarity
conference in Milan in April 2018, on a panel attacking the US decision
to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem that described Israel's
capital as the 'capital of Palestine.' While Schlein has not expressed
outright support for the BDS movement targeting Israel, a number of BDS
supporters spoke at the same conference, among them Francesco Giordano,
a former left-wing terrorist convicted of the 1980 murder of Walter
Tobagi, a Catholic journalist.

Several Italian pundits have pointed to Schlein's lukewarm support for
Ukraine's democratic government as the potential trigger for a mass
exodus of centrist PD members.

The Swiss-born Schlein worked as a volunteer in Chicago for former US
President Barack Obama's presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 before
moving to Italy in 2013. She was elected to the European parliament in
2014 before becoming the vice-president of the Emilia-Romagna region in
2020. Her campaign for the leadership of the PD was launched in 2022.

Pro-Palestinian activist went looking to beat Jews at NYC Israel rally -
prosecutors[8]A pro-Palestinian activist who committed a series of
attacks on Jews in New York City in 2021 and 2022 discussed bringing
firebombs to a pro-Israel rally, bragged about antisemitic assaults and
plotted how to evade law enforcement, according to federal prosecutors.

Saadah Masoud pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit hate crimes in
federal court in November as part of a plea agreement. His sentencing
for separate attacks on three Jews will be held on Friday in the
Southern District Court of New York. He faces up to two years in prison.

In a sentencing submission last week, prosecutors laid out discussions
Masoud held with his associates around the time of the crimes that
indicated the attacks were planned and targeted people they believed to
be Jewish or Israeli. Masoud's defense said the attacks were politically
and personally motivated.

In May of 2021, around the time of a conflict between Israel and the
Hamas terror group, Masoud discussed disrupting a pro-Israel rally in
Manhattan in a group chat on the Signal messaging app.

The group discussed bringing weapons to the pro-Israel rally, including
Molotov cocktails, prosecutors said.

One of the participants said, 'Remember, don't chant out Jews, it's the
Zionists,' apparently to evade allegations of antisemitism. Many Jewish
advocates hold that anti-Zionism is often a cover for antisemitism.
Masoud expressed support for the statement in the group chat.

Another participant in the group chat said, 'Fuck all Jews.'

'The defendant's attempt to place his actions in the context of
international affairs should be given little, if any credence,'
prosecutors wrote. 'The veil of 'anti-Zionism' is pathetically thin in
this case.' Saadah Masoud is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday, March
3, 2023 after pleading guilty to 'participating in a conspiracy to
commit hate crime acts' in connection with multiple physical assaults on

Sponsor of Portugal arena where Roger Waters will perform is one of
wealthiest Israelis[18]The Jewish Community of Porto has criticized
anti-Israel rock star Roger Waters who will be touring Europe in the
next few weeks and performing in Portugal but are especially troubled by
the fact that the venue's main sponsor is the Altice company, owned by
French-Israeli businessman Patrick Drahi.

The Pink Floyd bassist is a leading proponent of the BDS movement
against Israel.

The venue in Lisbon is the Altice Arena, which is among the largest
indoor arenas in Europe and the largest in Portugal with a capacity of
20,000 people.

A member of the Lisbon Jewish community told The Jerusalem Post on
Tuesday that 'we were shocked when we heard that Waters was coming to
perform in our country and even more surprised when we found out that he
will perform at the arena that is sponsored by an Israeli Jew.'

A spokesperson on behalf of Drahi told the Post on Thursday that 'Altice
would like to point out that it is the naming sponsor of the largest
concert hall in Lisbon, Portugal, but has no control over the
programming and the artists who perform there.'

The spokesperson explained that the review of the contracts linking
Altice to this concert hall 'does not allow Altice to intervene,' yet he
emphasized that 'obviously, the founder of Altice specifies that he
doesn't associate himself with this event and regrets it deeply.'

He continued by explaining that 'as soon as it became aware of the
programming, Altice reached out to the owner of the concert hall to see
if it was possible to cancel, but the owner said it was too late and
[they] could not cancel [the concert] as all the tickets were already
sold out.'

59-year-old Drahi is considered to be a pro-Israel philanthropist and
investor. He is one of the wealthiest citizens of Israel and owns major
communications companies such as Hot and i24NEWS. He has established The
Patrick and Lina Drahi Foundation, with his wife. According to the
foundation's website, PLFA focuses on Science, Education, Israel, the
Jewish People, Entrepreneurship, Innovation and the Arts. 'The Drahis
aim to share the fruits of their success with the community wherever the
family has its roots or business activities, taking part in projects
based in Israel, Portugal, Switzerland, France and the USA.' This is the
"Palestine Solidarity Campaign".

BBC WS radio tries to explain the 'Lions' Den' - part one[27]Listeners
were not informed that Nablus has been under Palestinian Authority
control since December 1995. Neither were they told that the Lions' Den
includes members or former members of existing factions, as reported by
Khaled Abu Toameh in September of last year: 'This is the first
organized armed group that consists of gunmen belonging to a number of
Palestinian factions - including Fatah, Hamas, IJ and the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.'

For example, of the six members of the Lions' Den killed in Nablus on
February 22nd, two also belonged to the PIJ and one to the al-Aqsa
Martyrs' Brigades.

Coomarsamy showed no interest in providing his listeners with a deeper
exploration of the topic of Hamas and PIJ funding for the Lions' Den and
Hamas' broader efforts to ferment terrorism and violence in Judea &
Samaria and Jerusalem.

In response to a question from Coomarasamy about how the Palestinian
Authority is 'dealing with this organisation', DeBre stated that 'it's
been really difficultbecause if they crack down too hard they're only
going to deepen their unpopularity'. She went on to add: DeBre: 'but
really there's not much that it [the PA] can do because Israel, you
know, just keeps storming into these cities to make these arrest raids.'

Neither DeBre nor Coomarasamy bothered to clarify to listeners that if
the Palestinian Authority fulfilled its obligations under the Oslo
Accords to 'act systematically against all expressions of violence and
terror', Israel would not have to carry out counter-terrorism operations
in places in which the PA is responsible for security.

Clearly BBC World Service radio's presentation of the Lions' Den as
'just a bunch of really disillusioned guys that have turned to violence'
failed to provide its worldwide listeners with an accurate and in depth
picture of that terrorist organisation and its role in the rising
violence.

Moreover, the same World Service programme aired another item the next
day on the same topic which will be discussed in part two of this
post.BBC WS radio tries to explain the 'Lions' Den' - part
two[28]Previously we discussed an item aired on the BBC World Service
radio programme 'Newshour' which purported to provide listeners with
'background' concerning the Nablus-based Lions' Den terror faction:

The following day - February 24th - listeners to the same programme
heard another item [from 45:05 here] on the same topic which was
introduced by presenter Julian Marshall as follows: Marshall: 'The city
of Nablus in the occupied West Bank has become a focal point for
increased tensions between Israel and the Palestinians with the
emergence of a group called Lions' Den. Israel has occupied - or rather
accused - the group of carrying out attacks on Israeli targets including
the killing in October of a soldier in the West Bank.'

The incident to which Marshall referred is the fatal shooting of Staff
Sgt. Ido Baruch. The Lions' Den claimed responsibility for that attack
so his use of the word 'accused' is clearly out of place and even
misleading. Referring to the counter-terrorism operation two days
earlier he continued: Marshall: 'On Wednesday Israeli forces carried out
a massive raid on Nablus in which eleven Palestinians were killed in gun
battles, among them six members of Lions' Den or other armed groups and
dozens more were injured.'

In fact, of the six members of the Lions' Den group killed, three were
also members of other terrorist organisations - two from the PIJ and one
from the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.

Having mentioned rallies 'in support of those killed in Nablus',
Marshall went on to introduce his sole interviewee: Marshall: 'I've been
speaking to Raed Debiy, political science lecturer at An Najah
University in Nablus. How would he describe the mood in the city today?'

In breach of BBC editorial guidelines concerning 'contributors'
affiliations', Marshall refrained from informing listeners that the
academic they were about to hear is also a leader of Fatah's youth
movement and a political activist. Here are Shapiro's last 8 articles.

Why Did Spotify Have an Official 'Hitler Radio' Playlist?[31]Until last
week, any Spotify user could access a playlist titled 'Musikkorps Der
Leibstandarte — SS Adolf Hitler Radio' — so named for the Nazi fuhrer's
personal corps of bodyguards. The streaming service itself generated the
track list, and multiple Rolling Stone staffers each received a
different mix upon loading it. Depending on Spotify's algorithm, the
streaming service chose different — often benign — national anthems from
throughout history, but two playlists featured music by Das
Luftwaffenmusikkorps 3 (named after the Nazi air force).

One day after Rolling Stone's inquiry to Spotify on why the service
would offer, let alone generate, an 'SS Adolf Hitler Radio' playlist —
as well as why it was hosting a RaHoWa podcast (short for 'Racial Holy
War') and several other instances of music espousing neo-fascist
ideologies — the streaming service removed them.

Spotify's platform rules prohibit 'content that incites violence or
hatred towards a person or group of people based on race, religion,
gender identity or expression, sex, ethnicity, nationality, sexual
orientation, veteran status, age, disability or other characteristics
associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization.' But despite
these guidelines and past instances of the Southern Poverty Law Center
(SPLC) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL) calling out the company and
other streaming services for allowing 'hate music,' musicians who
support white power, antisemitism, and neo-fascist ideology continue to
find homes on mainstream platforms.

Some groups, like the NSBM (National Socialist black metal) band
bermensch, attract more than 30,000 monthly listeners, while Burzum, a
Norwegian NSBM trailblazer who recently whined on Twitter about getting
flak for recommending Mein Kampf to readers, attracts 223,000 monthly
listeners.

A three-month Rolling Stone investigation into the catalogs of Spotify,
Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music turned up a surprising number of
purveyors of so-called hate music. Each service had musicians playing
NSBM and 'fashwave' (a proudly fascist form of electronic music), while
some also offered Nazi hardcore punk, RAC ('Rock Against Communism,' a
form of right-wing punk invented in reaction to the U.K .'s 'rock
against racism' concerts in the Seventies), and literal Nazi music from
the 1930s and Forties. Albania to open Holocaust museum after Israeli
call for Europe to step up antisemitism fight[32]The Albanian Culture
Ministry has announced the creation of the 'Besa Museum' in the capital
of Tirana to celebrate the history of Jews in Albania and the actions of
the Albanians that sheltered and saved them during WWII.

Albania has historically had a Jewish population including Saranda,
Berat and Vlora, with the latter two having Jewish quarters. During
World War II, Jews flocked from neighbouring countries and were welcomed
by Muslim and Christian Albanians. They were sheltered and hidden, given
'Albanian' names, and not handed over to Nazi or invading fascist
Italian forces.

It was the only country in Europe to have more Jews living in it at the
end of the war than at the start.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said: 'It is another very important
moment in Tirana's history, urban development, and architecture, and I
believe that we will finally be able to breathe a sigh of relief from a
long-standing burden of obligation in relation to our children and
visitors to our country, which is related to perhaps the most glorious
page of Albanian history, the rescue of Jews during WWII.'

The museum will be located in a historic building, currently empty and
once belonging to the Toptani Family. It embodies typical 19th-century
Albanian architecture and has been designated a Cultural Heritage and
Cultural Monument. Rama announced the establishment of the new museum at
a gala event honouring Albanian 'Righteous Among the Nations' during his
recent visit to Jerusalem.

Albania's Culture Ministry announced an open design competition for
architecture design proposals, funded by Israeli philanthropist
Alexander Machkevitch, with the goal of finding the best design solution
for the museum's construction.

'I am humbled to be a part of this important project that will
memorialise the bravery of Albanians who risked their lives to save Jews
during the Holocaust This project is a testament to the power of
solidarity and compassion in the face of darkness, and I hope it will
inspire future generations to continue this legacy of kindness,'
Machkevitch said. A good samaritan thankfully tore this banner down.

What was written on the banner was equally as horrifying as the swastika
itself - 'Thank you Bill Lee for tirelessly work to fight tr*nnies and
f*gs. We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white
children.' — StopAntisemitism (@StopAntisemites) March 3, 2023[33] Hey

Elbit inks $252 million deal to supply unnamed NATO country with rocket
systems[37]Israeli defense firm Elbit Systems announced Thursday it had
been awarded two contracts worth $252 million to supply an unnamed
European NATO member country with artillery systems.

The announcement came more than a month after Denmark said it was in
talks with Elbit for new mobile artillery to plug a 'critical gap,'
after pledging all 19 of its French-made Caesar howitzers to Ukraine.

The Danish defense ministry said negotiations were taking place 'for the
delivery of ATMOS artillery pieces and PULS rocket launcher systems as
soon as possible.'

The equipment could be delivered this year, the government said.

According to Elbit, the firm would supply the unnamed NATO member —
thought to be Denmark — with a battalion's worth of truck-mounted
howitzers, with a value of $119 million. The delivery of the ATMOS
systems would take place over a period of two years, the firm said.

The second contract would see the Israeli firm supply the NATO member
with $133 million worth of PULS artillery systems, including ammunition.
The supply would be delivered over three years, according to Elbit.

'We are witnessing a trajectory of an increased demand for advanced
artillery solutions from militaries around the world, including European
countries and NATO members, as part of their efforts to increase the
effectiveness of their armed forces,' said Bezhalel Machlis, the
president and CEO of Elbit, in remarks provided by the firm.Wiz Raises
$300 Million To Challenge Palo Alto Networks In Cloud Security[38]Times
are tough for startups that did not have the luck or foresight to raise
capital before the market for IPOs dried up in 2022. Many of those
startups are now struggling to raise capital and are shutting down — CB
Insights offers these 443 startup failure post-mortems — or being
acquired below their previous valuations.

But now is a great time to raise capital for the very best startups that
are charging to the lead of fast-growing recession-resistant technology
markets.

That's what cloud security services provider, Wiz, did on February 27
when it raised another $300 million. According to the company, this
brings Wiz's total capital raised to $900 million as its valuation
popped another 66% to $10 billion since the last time it raised capital
— $250 million at a $6 billion valuation — in October 2021.

In a February 27 interview, Assaf Rappaport told me why he thinks Wiz
was able to raise capital at a higher valuation and why brand name
companies are choosing its products over Palo Alto Networks PANW '
Prisma Cloud.

I requested comment from Palo Alto Networks and will update this post if
I receive it.

Despite the uncertain state of Israel's democracy, Wiz is likely to keep
growing rapidly. It is headquartered in New York City and the newly
raised capital is in the U.S. — not Israel.FIFA President Announces
Visit to Israel After Meeting With Counterpart From Israeli Football
Association[39]FIFA President Gianni Infantino will visit Israel in May
to see firsthand the progress of soccer as a sport in the country, he
announced on Tuesday after meeting with Israeli Football Association
(IFA) President Shino Moshe Zuares in Paris.

'I'm very much looking forward to the opportunity to travel to Israel to
see how far they have come since my previous visit,' said Infantino, who
added that soccer, 'has the capacity to bring people and communities
together, and the IFA have worked tirelessly to provide opportunities
for everyone to play the sport.'

Zuares said he welcomes the 'great news' about Infantino's upcoming
visit to Israel.

'We are able to show him what we have done, how we are improving and
what we are going to build in the future,' he noted. 'I appreciate the
visit very much. I appreciate the way that the President was positive
about all of our needs. For us, it's very, very important and we want to
see improvement immediately for Israeli football.'

FIFA's Chief of Global Football Development Arsne Wenger also attended
the meeting in Paris and Infantino said his knowledge and input as the
former coach of the soccer teams AS Monaco, Nagoya Grampus Eight and
Arsenal 'will reinforce and enhance coaching practices, ensuring players
across the range of ages will get the best possible education in the
game.'#8216;Wolf of Baghdad' launches teacher's guide[40]The Wolf of
Baghdad (a graphic novel, film and musical score) is Carol Isaacs'
original and highly successful telling of the story of the Jewish
community of Iraq and its brutal end, using animation. Together with
Matt Reingold, she has produced a teaching guide for pupils over 12. The
guide explains how to read Isaacs' cartoon panels and sets out nine
exercises for schools. Here is an extract from the guide's introduction:
https://www.jewishrefugees.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-03-at-07.52.06.pngPupils
are encouraged to fill in the speech bubbles ;;

In the 1940s, a third of Baghdad's population was Jewish. Within a
decade, nearly all 150,000 of the country's Jews had been expelled,
killed or had chosen to escape. Carol Isaacs' The Wolf of Baghdad is a
wordless graphic memoir of a lost homeland by an author homesick for a
home she has never visited. Transported by the power of music to her
ancestral home in the old Jewish quarter of Baghdad, Isaacs encounters
its ghost-like inhabitants who are revealed as long-gone family members.
Accompanied by a wolf who trails after her, Isaacs explores the city,
journeying through their memories and her imagination. She at first sees
successful integration, and cultural and social cohesion. Then the mood
turns darker with the fading of this ancient community's fortunes. The
wolf, an animal believed by Baghdadi Jews to protect people from harmful
demons, sees that Jewish life in Iraq is over, and returns Isaacs safely
back to London.

Like other works of literature, successfully using graphic novels in the
classroom requires careful planning and deep understanding of the
content and themes of the work. What can make graphic novels more
difficult to use is their blend of visual and verbal texts, with many
educators less comfortable teaching students how to 'read' visuals in
order to draw meaning from the image. To that end, this reading guide is
structured to help educators teach their students how to read graphic
narratives. As well, background readings about the historical context of
Isaacs' work and sample exercises are included to foster critical
thinking about The Wolf of Baghdad. Free download of the teaching

Touted Darius inscription is inauthentic, Israel Antiquities Authority
clarifies[44]The Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Friday that
an inscription on an ancient shard uncovered in southern Israel, which
it attributed earlier in the week with much fanfare to the Persian King
Darius the Great, is not authentic.

On March 1, the state-run archaeological body reported that the
discovery of the 2,500-year-old fragment, which visitors found in
December at the Tel Lachish national park, was the first bearing an
inscription with Darius the Great's name anywhere in Israel.

However, in a rare weekend press announcement two days later, the IAA
stated that an expert, who participated in the expedition last August
contacted it following the publication of the find. The scholar informed
the authority that she had created the inscription 'while demonstrating
to a group of students the manner in which sherds were inscribed in
ancient times.' ('Sherd' is a technical term that often overlaps with
'shard.')

The scholar accidentally left the shard on the site, leading to the
erroneous identification, per the statement.

'The IAA takes full responsibility for the unfortunate event,' stated
Gideon Avni, IAA chief scientist. He noted that a 'leading' researcher
and an archaeologist studying the site examined the piece. 'As an
institution that strives for the scientific truth, we are committed to
correcting the mistake that was made and making it known to the
public.'Israeli NGOs bring aid to those in need in India[45]The Indian
capital of Delhi is ground zero for Indian politics and media, but
high-rising Mumbai is the stylish capital of Indian business and cinema.

Walking out the doors of the airport, one passes shiny new eateries
lining the way out, giving way to a highway lined with luxurious hotels
and slick skyscrapers - commercial and residential; the kind that fill
much of the city and its suburbs. The wealthiest parts of town look as
posh as anything New York or London can offer.

But a brief drive south on that highway reveals the extreme disparities
that characterize Indian cities. Dharavi, the huge slum that was the
inspiration for the novel Q&A and the subsequent film Slumdog
Millionaire, is a short distance from Bandra. In this neighborhood,
Bollywood stars live in luxury condos next to the Bharat Diamond Bourse,
the world's largest diamond exchange. A taxi driver or bellboy may
service wealthy businessmen all day and return at night to his brick
two-room home in the Dharavi or Kalwa slums.

Less fortunate neighbors may squat illegally in tin shacks in
unrecognized neighborhoods which lack the proper infrastructure for
electricity, water and sewage treatment. As contractors may buy the
scarce land for development at any time, the squatters also live under
constant threat of eviction. Mumbai is Los Angeles with slums, monsoons,
and tropical diseases, but interestingly, without gun violence. The slum
inhabitants are villagers who moved to the city, work in menial labor
and cannot afford the stiff price of housing. They are productive and
not tempted to engage in criminal activity.Podcast Hosts Sasha
Spielberg, Alana Haim Talk About Proudly Feeling Jewish 'Every Single
Second of the Day'[46]Musicians and friends Alana Haim and Sasha
Spielberg talked about their Jewish backgrounds, friendship and middle
school memories, that included many bat mitzvah parties, in a new
interview with the website Hey Alma.

Haim and her two older sisters make up the band called Haim while
Spielberg, the daughter of director Steven Spielberg, will release her
second studio album under the stage name Buzzy Lee in April. The Los
Angeles natives are co-hosts of Free Period, a podcast in which they
discuss their most embarrassing childhood memories as well as those of
their guests.

The childhood friends told Hey Alma in unison that they feel Jewish
'every single second of the day' and started off their interview with
the publication by reminiscing on their years in the bat mitzvah
circuit.

'I have been chasing the high of bat mitzvah season my whole life,' said
Haim, who made her acting debut in the 2021 film Licorice Pizza. 'I
didn't go to a Jewish school, but I went to a school where all my
friends were Jewish. And it was every weekend. If you didn't have a bat
mitzvah or a bar mitzvah to go to, it meant that you weren't invited to
one, and then Monday was like, Inspector Gadget — like, who did not
invite me to their bat mitzvah?

'When I met Sasha, it was like, we really both did have this [same
background]. She was one of the only people in my life that I could
really divulge deep into that time,' she added.

The podcast hosts also talked to Hey Alma about Jewish cultural figures
they looked up to when they were younger, like Barbara Streisand and
Natalie Portman, and Haim said she always— until today — felt 'cool' and
'super proud' for being Jewish.Filmmaker Steven Spielberg Says Global
Antisemitism is 'Standing Proud,' 'No Longer Lurking'[47]Academy
Award-winning director Steven Spielberg explained why he finds the rise
of public displays of antisemitism in the US and around the world 'very,
very surprising' during his interview on Thursday night with late night
talk show host Stephen Colbert.

'Antisemitism has always been there. It's either been just around the
corner and slightly out of sight but always lurking or it has been much
more overt, like in Germany in the 30s,' the Jewish filmmaker said
during a segment that appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.
'But not since Germany in the 30s have I witnessed antisemitism no
longer lurking but standing proud with hands on hips like Hitler and
Mussolini. Kind of daring us to defy it. I have never experienced this
in my entire life, especially in this country.'

During his first late-night interview Spielberg also discussed his
latest movie, the Oscar-nominated autobiographical film The Fabelmans,
which was inspired by his own childhood and dives into how he developed
his love of filmmaking. The coming-of-age drama shows aspects of
Spielberg's Jewish life and upbringing, such as him celebrating Jewish
holidays with his family and the antisemitic bullying he faced.

During their conversation that aired on Thursday night Colbert also
asked Spielberg why he thinks antisemitism is 'raising its ugly head'
now more publicly than it has in the past. The director, who established
the Shoah Foundation after helming the Academy Award-winning film the
Schindler's List, replied that 'the marginalizing of people that aren't
some kind of a majority race is something that has been creeping up on
us for years, and years, and years and somehow in 2014, 2015, 2016, hate
has became a kind of membership to a club that is gotten more members
than I ever thought is possible in America. And hate and antisemitism go
hand-in-hand. You can't separate one from the other.'

Still, Spielberg is optimistic that hatred and antisemitism will not
prevail in conquering mankind. He paraphrased a quote from Holocaust
victim Anne Frank, who wrote in her famed diary: 'In spite of everything
I still believe that people are really good at heart.' 'Not since
Germany in the '30s have I witnessed antisemitism, no longer lurking but
standing proud with hands on hips like Hitler and Mussolini — kind of
daring us to defy it. I've never experienced this in my entire life.
Especially in this country.' — Steven Spielberg #Colbert[48]

Smoking Relapse Less Likely Among Vapers: Study

Indian Pharma Industry : Policies

December 3, 2018 Monday

Length: 200 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Dec. 03 -- Smokers who switch to vaping can have the
occasional cigarette without a complete relapse, new research suggests.

The study included 40 people who quit smoking by using e-cigarettes
(vaping). About half said they had either brief or regular tobacco
smoking relapses, particularly in social situations.

However, they didn't view such slip-ups as the end of their attempt to
quit smoking.

"In the past, a brief smoking lapse would almost always lead to a full
relapse, and people would usually feel like a failure for slipping up.
But this was before people started switching to vaping," said lead
researcher Caitlin Notley.

"The difference is that for some vapers (in this study), the odd
cigarette was thought of as being 'allowed.' For others, an
unintentional cigarette made them even more determined to maintain
abstinence in the future," said Notley, of the University of East Anglia
in England.

"Either way, it didn't necessarily lead to a full relapse back into
smoking," she added in a university news release.

The findings suggest that use of e-cigarettes not only helps people quit
smoking, but also can help prevent long-term smoking relapse, according
to the authors.

Scaling Up Industrial IoT Deployments - Challenges, Issues and Solutions

Internet of Things (IoT) has been on the hotbed of activity for the last
several years. While till about 2015, IOT was at its peak of 'Gartner
Hype Cycle', the euphoria has died down considerably with many others
like AI and blockchain taking its slot at the top. IoT is on a downward
path of the Hype cycle now but as the authors have articulated in
previous posts, articles and interviews, IoT, especially Industrial IoT,
would see steady but slow progress over a decade. IT deployment and
automation took decades and the adoption did not happen overnight.

While the IoT story in consumers, homes, logistics and automotive
sectors have taken off in a reasonably big way with several tens of
millions of devices being deployed, the Industrial IoT deployments have
been relatively slow. While there have been several small to mid-scale
pilots, the infrastructure in industrial settings has several
complicacies and lack the simplicity and standardization of the consumer
side.

Industrial IoT, especially in factories, is also mired with business
RoI, cultural and organizational issues that slow down its deployment
primarily because of misalignment between workers, managers and owners.
This has been talked about in several settings and we had a classic
example on how Bharat Forge overcame this and executed on its Digital
Transformation comprehensively at IoTNext 2018.

In terms of the technical aspects, factory automation has been
non-standard, using age-old protocols and different brands. Hence IoT
systems in an industrial scenario have to be extremely versatile. Just
basic connectivity of sensors and sending every bit and byte of data to
the cloud severely restricts Industrial IoT deployments and the cost
goes up significantly.

It is to be noted that bringing Internet connectivity to the shop floor
is a relatively new concept. Also, no factory will ever replace their
machines overnight with new and smart IoT enabled machines from OEMs.
Industrial systems in the near future will continue to remain a
hodgepodge of different systems, some having a robust implementation of
PLC systems and SCADA networks, others running full manual. 'Don't touch
it, if it is not broken yet', 'Let it fail, before we replace', 'AMC
contractors coming periodically to test and maintain', 'misuse of
machinery is common', 'clueless about power quality impact to machines'
are the usual patterns we see not just in the developing countries but
also in developed markets as well.

The following series of articles is based on real practitioners'
viewpoints, over five years of learning across industries, observation
of a plethora of IoT deployments and startup failures, discussions with
several IoT vendors and systems integrators and real-life experience
from running a full-fledged IoT system involving several thousands of
devices. Below are the topics that we intend to cover in this series.

1. A versatile and flexible architecture that works at the edge,
in-premise and cloud

2. Overcoming the issues of connectivity and the importance of robust
build management

3. Importance of regular sensor calibration, quality check and system
health check

4. 'IoT Data Simulator' to simulate a multitude of data, corner cases,
erratic and erroneous data flow and how to deal with them

5. Formal API Management for data analytics and the full systems

6. The learning and signal processing system for 2V (volume and
velocity) data in edge computing

Interestingly, most of these above aspects are either not required or
are side-stepped during Pilot and Proof of Concepts, but they come back
to bite you as you scale.

While we will discuss each of the above aspects in subsequent articles,
let us focus on the overall IoT and analytics architecture here for
industrial use cases.

A versatile and flexible architecture that works both at Edge,
In-premise and Cloud

IoT is all about sensor data. These data are recorded in the cloud or in
edge with a timestamp. The timestamp indicates the time of data origin
and hence sensor data is a classical time series data. The challenge is
on how to extract useful analytics or actionable intelligence out of
these sensor signals. Some of the issues like the elimination of noise,
detection of artifacts from the signal trend can be solved using
traditional signal analysis. Additional areas to consider are
infrastructural issues and end-user requirements and restrictions,
running the signal analysis on a platform that can easily be ported into
cloud, edge or on-premise. There are difficulties associated with
extracting the signal artifacts too quickly or over a larger period of
time using the same computational system.

We believe that the entire signal analysis ideally has to be done by an
edge platform for sensor signal analysis and transforming that analysis
into actionable intelligence using a diverse set of architecture such as
working with sensor edge, edge cloud or a public cloud (like Azure
PaaS/IaaS). Sometimes even a cloud is not required, factories want to
connect the data to a platform straight to HMI or mobile app or to a
desktop app. Industrial 4.0 is not yet standard and therefore, it makes
sense to offer an architecture which is highly flexible and offers all
the cross-platform importing/exporting capability.

So what does the Flexible Edge Architecture really mean?

Edge analytic or edge computation is set on a massive growth path.
However, in the context of a factory or commercial building, edge
architecture can penetrate into the diversified system architecture.
Edge computation can happen with sensor electronics as close to the
sensor as possible, it can happen on a gateway device, a PC or server
connected to the Gateway or Router, a factory cloud which may be a
server inside the factory or an external public cloud framework. The
whole system may or may not be connected to a public cloud (like AWS or
Azure) depending on end-customer requirements and restrictions.

Due to lack of a unified or standardized architecture of Industrial 4.0,
it is extremely important for OEM (who wants to make a smart machine) to
be cognizant of the reality that their customers (manufacturing plants)
may or may not allow external cloud. Many may not have a factory cloud.
They may or may not want the data to be displayed in PLC. They may want
the system to be incubated into a major Industrial IoT PaaS platform
like Azure IoT PaaS or Siemens Mindsphere, or these might be too costly
propositions for them.

MachineSense.com also went through its own set of learning, spending
enormous resources with each customer with its 'public cloud only'
approach and had to re-engineer and re-architect its entire platform to
be completely flexible, with the ability to feed data to any form of
repository, be it a resident computer, a handheld device, an in-premise
cloud or an external cloud. The architecture had to adapt to the
requirements, had to be scaled up or down based on the restrictions.

Subsequent articles will focus on the challenges in larger scale
deployment and what are the typical ways to mitigate and address them.
Many platforms do not provide these bells and whistles to manage and
hence a lot of watchdogs, calibration routines, automation tools had to
be built to ensure smooth operation for a large IoT deployment and to
manage the device efficiently.

How does an author get inspired and become successful? Find out in these
insights from speakers at the Bangalore Business Literature Festival.

The seventh annual Bangalore Business Literature Festival (BBLF) will be
held virtually this year due to the ongoing pandemic. As the festival
media partner, see YourStory's coverage of the earlier editions in 2020,
2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015.

See also YourStory's Book Review section with reviews of over 320
titles, and our compilation of 85 Quotes on World Book Day.

BBLF 2021 will be held on September 21-23 next week. Our earlier four
preview articles addressed startup advice, failure recovery, business
resilience, and reader patterns. In this article, authors discuss their
creativity habits, influencers, reader reactions, plans for their next
books, and tips for aspiring writers.

1. Creativity habits

"I have some unusual habits as a writer. I only like to write when
inspired, and the words flow," says Bhavna Dalal, Founder and CEO of
Talent Power Partners, and author of Checkmate Office Politics.

"Most of my writings come from the real-life experiences of executives
and leaders in the workplace as part of my coaching work. Although an
avid reader in my childhood and teens, I consciously don't read other
books when I am writing," she adds.

"I do jot down ideas immediately when they come to me, such as in a
flight, while walking, or during other mundane activities. Later, I sit
down to develop them. Meditation is a powerful practice to develop as a
writer," Bhavna emphasises.

"Journaling helps you to gain better clarity on your thoughts and ideas,
and also clear up any roadblocks you may have that are clogging your
mental bandwidth," says Karthik Nagendra, CEO of ThoughtStarters, and
author of The Thought Leader Way: Leading Your Business with Thought
Leadership in an Altered World.

"Being a certified life coach, I understand the value of journaling and
recommend to my clients that they practice journaling regularly," he
adds.

Karthik also practices painting and listening to music that boosts
creativity. "Going on long drives, too, has helped me as it gives 'me
time' to think about the book idea more clearly," he says.

"I don't keep a journal, but I have a notebook where I write down ideas.
Of course, I read a lot, but there is no target in a week or month. I do
listen to music a lot," says Hari Pulakkat, author of Space. Life.
Matter: The Coming of Age of Indian Science, and editor of science and
technology magazine IITM Shaastra.

"I read a lot and across different genres. I also feel that time away
from social media and its incessant noise is essential to remain
creative. So, I ensure I have at least one day a week when I do not
access social media," explains Kaninika Mishra, author of The Indic
Quotient: Reclaiming Heritage Through Cultural Enterprise.

"I dedicate an hour a day for writing of all kinds. Another hour a day
to read and share content from my feeds and my website," says Jessie
Paul, CEO of B2B consulting firm, Paul Writer, and author of No-Money
Marketing: From Upstart to Big Brand on a Frugal Budget.

"I also read fiction - whatever comes my way - for at least 30 minutes a
day. I keep track of my ideas on Trello, a workflow tool," she adds.

"One of the biggest challenges I faced initially was burnout because I
was always thinking about and working on my research and book. That
wasn't healthy," recalls Vivan Marwaha, user researcher and author of
What Millennials Want: Decoding the Largest Generation in the World.

"The moment I started taking more time off, I not only started feeling
better and had more energy, but I became much more productive as well,"
he adds.

Rishad Tobaccowala reads every morning from 5 to 6 am. He is Senior
Advisor to the Publicis Groupe and author of Restoring the Soul of
Business: Staying Human in the Age of Data.

"I mark my books with pencil and star key lines. I then copy them with a
pen into a notebook. I keep a visual journal of photographs using an app
called Day One," he says.

"I exercise every day. Getting my mind ready to write is super
important," says David Meerman Scott, author of The New Rules of
Marketing and PR and Fanocracy: Turning Fans Into Customers and
Customers Into Fans.

"I listen to audiobooks a lot and also read Kindle books much more than
earlier," says R Gopalakrishnan, author of over 15 books on management.

2. Creative influences

Fiction and nonfiction writers have influenced Hari Pulakkat. "I had
studied English literature in college, and so I have read many great
writers. It is hard to pick a few, but Henry James and Charles Dickens
are two that I have enjoyed the most," he says.

Among the writers after World War II, Saul Bellow and John Updike are
his favourites. "I read a lot of comic fiction, and I enjoyed David
Lodge and Malcolm Bradbury a lot. Among contemporary writers, I would
pick A S Byatt," he adds.

"It is hard to pick favourite nonfiction writers, because of the sheer
variety. In travel writing, I read a lot of Paul Theroux and some Pico
Iyer," Hari says.

"In my own genre of science writing, two books (and writers) that I
consider as the gold standard are Chaos by James Gleick and The Man Who
Knew Infinity by Robert Kanigel," he explains.

He also enjoys good books written by journalists. "There is something
special about discovering a new subject and then writing about it," he
observes.

Karthik Nagendra has read a lot of non-fiction books around leadership,
psychology, and history. As notable influences, he cites What got you
here won't get you there (Marshall Goldsmith), Man's search for Meaning
(Viktor Frankl), Homo sapiens (Yoval Noah Harari), and A world with
three zeroes (Muhammad Yunus).

"Each of them has impressed me with the research, insights, and
narration that can make an impact on various aspects of an individual,
business, and society," Karthik adds.

Jesse Paul enjoys books on consumer behaviour and consumer economics.
"They make me think. The most recent book was Talking to Strangers by
Malcolm Gladwell. I like all his books," she says.

"I even read The Bomber Mafia, which has nothing to do with business but
was still a compelling read. Dan Ariely and Daniel Pink are other
authors I enjoy. Freakonomics and The Undercover Economist are other fun
books," she adds.

Jesse reads a lot of non-fiction and popular authors like John Grisham
and Jeffrey Archer every time she visits an airport. "I'm not a fan of
autobiographies, but Becoming by Michelle Obama was compelling," she
recalls.

"From a marketing thinking perspective, I'd say Kotler's textbooks, Al
Ries, Jack Trout, David Ogilvy, and Rama Bijapurkar have influenced my
thinking," she says.

3. Reader reactions

All the authors are proud their books are doing well, and share some
unusual and inspiring reactions from readers.

"My LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter inboxes are full of messages from
people many degrees removed from me telling me about how they have liked
my book for its focus on those stories not always highlighted by the
media," Vivan Marwaha explains.

"It's an amazing feeling to receive such praise from people you don't
know since that demonstrates the book is reaching a wide and diverse
audience," he enthuses.

"I received messages from people who read my book, saying they could
identify what they needed to change in themselves to get out of repeated
office politics patterns," says Bhavna Dalal.

"The most common feedback has been about the positive twist on a
negative subject. People are intrigued to know more about an Indian
woman's perspective on politics in the workplace," she adds.

"My book has been very well received and continues to sell well. The
most unusual response is that people think I wrote it post-COVID-19
because so many of the themes resonate even more now than ever before,"
says Rishad Tobaccowala. His book has a chapter on managing distributed
workforces.

"Since my book, The Indic Quotient, converges two contemporary themes,
namely the growing pride in India's heritage and the passion for
enterprise, it resonates with a large number of readers," Kaninika
Mishra explains.

The book coincided with the call for 'vocal for local' made by the Prime
Minister in 2020 to promote indigenous products and ideas. "Therefore,
the book became topical and generated interest," she adds. A young
budding entrepreneur even requested her to invest in his 'vocal for
local' venture!

"My book, The Thought Leader Way, has been receiving a positive response
from various segments - students, marketing professionals, CEOs, and
entrepreneurs," says Karthik Nagendra.

"It was heartening to see some of them practically try out some of the
strategies and approaches shared in the book and seeing positive
traction. They have personally reached out to me and shared their
experiences," he adds.

"My book, Marketing Without Money, is currently at the early review
stage. I've shared it with people I look up to in the business world,
and, so far, the response has been that it is a very useful book for
anyone with a product to take to market," Jesse Paul explains.

Her book has places where the reader can take notes and fill the answers
from their own perspective into the frameworks provided. "That has been
positively received as it makes the book more engaging. There is a
demand for an audible version, which I've passed on to my publisher,"
she adds.

"I think that my books have been well received. When the four publishers
who have published my 16 books (17th coming in November 2021) still
discuss new book ideas with me, I know they must have done reasonably
well," says R Gopalakrishnan, whose titles include A Biography of
Innovations and Wisdom For Startups From Grown-ups.

He says the most unusual response from readers is, "How come there is no
jargon or gyan, just simply anecdotes and examples?"

4. Author journeys

Some of the authors also share what excites them in the long journey of
their books and what challenges they faced.

"The most exciting moment for an author is when a good book idea falls
in place with a nearly audible click! The most challenging part is
waiting to hear the sound of that click of a new idea," Raghunathan
says.

"The most exciting part of an author's journey is that you are
positioned as an expert in the subject matter. When you see your ideas
making an impact on people's lives, the satisfaction is priceless,"
Karthik Nagendra enthuses.

"The most challenging part would be to market the book well to ensure it
captures the mind share of readers, and thereby garner better sales," he
adds.

5. Next steps

Many featured authors at BBLF are already working on their next books or
related projects. Others are exploring appropriate themes, formats, and
publishers.

Kaninika Mishra is currently working on two ideas. "One is a book for
children that uses some ideas from The Indic Quotient. The other is a
non-fiction book focused on Northeast India," she says.

"I have been travelling extensively in the Northeast and have covered
five of the seven states as of now. I am absolutely fascinated by the
beauty and culture of the region," she enthuses.

Rishad Tobaccowala says his one-year-old weekly newsletter has over
10,000 subscribers and 40,000 readers a week due to social media and
sharing. "It is scaling really fast and may preclude the need for a book
in that it is a living book filled with wonderful art. The book may be a
container of the past," he explains.

Jesse Paul has written just under 500 issues of her newsletter. "The
issues deal with a wide variety of topics - personal branding,
diversity, marketing, strategy, and ethics. I want to curate these into
a fast, snappy read," she says.

Bhavna Dalal has already started work on her next book. "It will be
about amplifying your influencing skills in the workplace. The approach
is working inwards and on yourself to have the desired impact in the
world outside," she says.

Karthik Nagendra is working on is a business topic with a fiction
approach. "Tentatively titled I and AI, it chronicles the journey of a
teenage girl on an industrial visit to a leading AI-services
corporation. There, the curious teen has a chance conversation with a
cyborg," he describes.

"A routine educational visit sets off a chain of events that forever
entwines her future and that of the worlds. Set in 2035, I and AI
explores the new world order built on AI and how it addresses the issues
of the traditional world while inadvertently (maybe not so
inadvertently) creating a new one of its own," Karthik explains.

He says such a book requires an impassioned writer with a nuance for
exploring the depths of the future face of AI and sensitisation towards
the need for a gender-equal society. "The book's theme pertains to AI
and a woman's journey into the tech space," he adds.

"I have completed a book on behavioural economics, summarising the works
of ten Nobel Laureates, telling the story of the transition of
neo-classical economics to behavioural economics," explains V
Raghunathan, BBLF Chair, and former Professor, IIM Ahmedabad.

His bestsellers include Games Indians Play, Ganesha on the Dashboard;
The Corruption Conundrum; and Locks, Mahabharata and Mathematics. He has
also been spending some time working on his collection of locks and
showcasing them on a few platforms. Raghunathan writes occasional
newspaper columns as well.

"I am also working on a new book (with my wife for the first-ever time)
on what the educational system as a whole (teachers, parents, schools)
needs to teach more of to children to help them cope with a complex
world, and grow into more confident, strong, trustworthy, and dutiful
citizens," he adds.

Vivan Marwaha works at the intersection of people, policy, and
technology. "I am fascinated by how technology is shrinking the
opportunity gap around the world. My next book will most likely examine
the role of technology in shaping the human endeavour," he says.

"People love Fanocracy. It made the Wall Street Journal bestseller
list," says David Meerman Scott. He is working on the new eighth edition
of his international bestseller, The New Rules of Marketing and PR.

R Gopalakrishnan's next book is Pivots for Career Success: people and
human relationships, along with R Srinivasan. Hari Pulakkat says he is
thinking of exploring some ideas not fully developed in his first book
but is also looking at other ideas.

6. Tips for aspiring authors

The authors share a number of tips for aspiring authors on reading,
writing, and market assessment.

"There is no difference between those who cannot read and those who do
not read. And by reading, I mean reading books. Not online snippets or
WhatsApp chatter," advises Raghunathan.

"It takes time and effort and a lot of revision to write a book. Without
patience, nothing can be achieved," Hari Pulakkat says.

"Take the plunge. Swim as deep as you can. The result will be very
rewarding," advises Benedict Paramanand, co-founder of BBLF and author
of CK Prahalad - The Mind of the Futurist.

"Don't write with the eye on Will it sell, Will I make money, Will
anyone read my book. Write for yourself, for the experience of bringing

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is developingrapidly, and countries from
around the globe are beginning to articulate nationalstrategies for
handling the political ramifications. With A.I. powering innovations
such as driverless cars, autonomous drones,full-sequence genetic
analytics, and powerful voice-assistanttechnology, the future
certainlylooks full of potential. Unsettledquestions, however, aboutwho
will reapthese benefits and when theywill be achieved leave storm clouds
on the political horizon.

Amid questions of industrial concentration and economic inequality on
one side,and concerns aboutlagging U.S. productivity and the slow pace
of A.I. diffusion on the other,there is an underexamined overlap that
connects these questions to the same set of policies: high barriers to
entrydue to supply-side constraints.

There are significant barriers to entryin A.I. development and
application, manyof which stem directly from government policies. These
barriers haveinadvertently boosted themarket power of incumbent firms
and in reducing them,we may enable new firms to compete better, while
also removing someof the bottlenecks that slow down research
andintegration of A.I.systems across the entire economy.

Supply of Skilled A.I. Analysts

Perhaps the single biggest bottleneck in A.I.development and application
today is the supply of skilled datascientists and machine-learning
engineers. Typical A.I.specialists can expectto earn between $300,000and
$500,000 at top tech firms, numbersthat are significantly higher than
their peers in othercomputer-science-related subfields. In addition to
these ballooning salaries, industryexperts such as Hal Varianhave
pointed to the scarcityof adequate A.I.talent as the largest factor
behind slow application in the economy.

Reform Our Immigration System toAllow More High-Skill A.I. Talent

Thepolicy lever with perhaps the highest degreeof leverage to begin
immediately alleviating thistalent shortage is our immigration system
and, morespecifically, reforming visasfor international graduate
students.

In 2015, the United States had 58,000 graduate students in computer
science fields, the overwhelming majorityof which (79 percent)
wereinternational. This influxof talent represents a significant portion
of the overallA.I. talent supplybeing cultivated eachyear, as
studentsfrom all over the world are attracted to the nation'stop
education system.In particular, the United States

attracts large numbersof students fromChina and India.Due to a limited
numberof visa slots, however, only a fractionof these studentsare
allowed to work in the countrylong term.

The primary pathwayfor these highlyskilled immigrants to stay in the
countryis through the H-1Bvisa program. For the past 16 years, however,
the H-1B limit has been exhaustedand, in more recent years, the number
of applications filedhas consistently beentwice as highas the numberof
available spots. This discrepancy is almost certainly understatingthe
scope of the problem, as it does not accountfor the ways in
whichforeknowledge about the difficulty of acquiring a work visa
maydeter students from applying in the first place.

Although it also limits the talent pool availableto large tech firms,
the status quo is especially daunting for startups, as they do not have
the specialized Human Resources personnel to handle the bureaucracy of
the immigration visa application process.Including application
andattorney fees, to sponsor a work visa typically costs around $5,000
per employee, and the paperworkburdens appear to be increasing. Boththe
financial and bureaucratic costsare easier for established firmsto bear,
given theirlarger size and increased resources.

In turn, thiscost impacts thetypes of firmshigh-skill immigrants
willapply to workfor in the first place.Even when attracted to work at
startups, foreign workers may ultimatelyprivilege their applications to
incumbents because they willlikely have a better chanceof obtaining
workvisas at established firms.Additionally, since startups face high
failure rates, job loss could meantermination of work authorization as
well - which would mean that the entire visaapplication process would
have to be approached anew.

Accordingly, to allow more international studentsto live and work in the
United States upon completion of their degree - eitherthrough an
expansion and simplification of the H-1B visa program or through the
creation of a new technical workervisa program - would be a relatively
straightforward and effectivemethod to alleviate the country's talent
shortage around A.I. In particular, this reform wouldbenefit smaller
firmsand startups that are unableto access existing foreign-born
talentto the same degree as established firms.

Allow Companies to Deduct the Cost of Training A.I. Talent

In addition to reforming our immigration pathwaysfor high-skilled
A.I.talent, it wouldbe wise for theUnited States to extend moreeffort
toward building up domestic talent.One way to achieve this endwould be
to better align incentives for companies to develop A.I. talent
internally.

As the numberof newly mintedmachine learning (ML) Ph.D. students
continues to dwindle, some companies are looking at training employees
internally to essentially create new supply. Such training,however,
requires significant investment on the company's part, both in timeand
resources, to trainnew A.I. specialists this way, and the gainsfrom this
training are mostly captured by the newly trained worker inthe form of
higher wages. Since workers can jump ship from the companies that train
them at any time for a highersalary at a competitor, employershave few

opportunities to recoup the costs of worker training. It thus seems
likely thatemployers are generally underinvesting in worker trainingwhen
compared to the amountthat might otherwise be efficient. We should
therefore look more closely atincentivizing this socially desirable
behavior through the tax code.

Employers may currently deduct a portionof the costs of workertraining
as longas it is to improve productivity in a role theyalready occupy,
but this credit is fairly small and employers may not deduct the costs
if it would qualifythem for a new tradeor business. Expanding this
deduction - bothin size and scope - so that the full cost of worker
trainingfor new tradescould be deducted, would incentivize
moreinvestment in building the A.I. workforce that is needed to fuel our
economy. Giventhe pre-existing levelof interest by employers in this
strategy, it seems likelythis could become a fruitful part of our
domestic A.I. pipeline, if given more support.

Supply of Data

In many ways,the supply of high-quality machine-readable training data
is the key enabler of ML.Without access to some underexplored dataset, a
team of talented A.I.specialists can be left twiddling their
thumbs.Consumer data in the UnitedStates is particularly valuable, but
hereagain large incumbents have significant (thoughnot unsurmountable)
data advantages over startups.

But we can potentially create high-leverageopportunities for startups to
compete against established firms if we canincrease the supply of
high-quality datasets available to the public. As withincreasing the
supply of A.I. talent, this reform will help both incumbents
andstartups, but on the margin it will be the smallerfirms with less
access to consumer data who benefitmost.

Encourage the Creation of OpenDatasets and Data Sharing

One of the easiest ways to begin this process wouldbe a more thorough
examination of existing government datasets that are notpublic. As an
example of previous projects that were broadly successful,consider the
U.S.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Landsat
projects,both of which made weather-satellite data available to the
public and, in turn,developed into a multi-billion-dollar industry,
creating more accurateforecasts of extreme weather and crop patterns.

There appears to be even more potential fromdatasets the government owns
but has not made public. For example, many citiesand municipalities have
useful data around traffic patterns, electricity usageand business
development that, if made accessible, could lead to reduced-cost service
provision andbetter analytics.

There is also the matter of industries in whichopen data might become
the norm if existing regulations are relaxed orstreamlined. The
healthcare industry seems a particularly promising target inthis
respect, as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act(HIPAA) has long

been considered a barrier to the development of data sharing
betweenmedical professionals and companies. Allowing consumer healthdata
to be more easily shared with the proper privacy safeguards couldenable
a renaissance in drug development and personalized medicine, as recent
ML advances have proven quite promisingwhen appropriate data have been
available.

Each new datasetthat can be easily shared or, when appropriate, made
public, increases the odds both that anew startup will be able to
leverage it for success, and also that a newindustry can thrive around
the increased predictive analysis the releaseddata has enabled.For
recent advances in A.I. to diffusethroughout the economy, we must
makesure the underlying data is accessible.

Clarify the Fair-Use Exemption forTraining Data

In addition to making more government datasets opensource, we should
also take a second look at some of the intellectual propertylaws that
intersect and interact with the ML process, specifically copyright law.

Imagine a hypothetical startup focused on thecreation of a
natural-language-processing application. One readily available source of
humandialogue the companymight consider learning from would be the last
50 years of Hollywood scripts,many of whichare scrapable fromvarious
online databases. Such an endeavor, however, would standon legally
dubiousgrounds, as these scripts remain copyrighted worksand there have
not been clear legal guidelines established to delineate whatis
allowable as fair usein ML training data. Giventhis uncertainty, it is
morelikely that such a startup would avoid this potential legal
minefieldand consider what other datasets might be availablewith less
risk.

Such is the ambiguous state of copyrightenforcement in ML today. And it
may also have important and underexploredapplications for the state of
competition in A.I.

There are an enormous numberof copyrighted worksthat are scrapable from
the Internet, the data of which iscurrently underexploited in part
because of its legally dubious standing ifused as training data. This
reform could represent, then, a significant leverto create new arbitrage
opportunities for scrappystartups willing to find and leverage
interesting datasets.

Given the existing ambiguity around theissue and thelarge potential
benefits to be reaped,further study and clarification of the legalstatus
of trainingdata in copyright law should be a top prioritywhen
considering new ways to boost the prospects of competition and
innovation in the A.I. space.

Access to Specialized Hardware

Underlying the data being used to train ML modelsand the data scientists
who are building them is the physical infrastructure ofthe A.I. world.
This primarily takes the form of the computer servers

and chipsets that ML models are trained andoperated on. In recent years,
this hardware has become increasingly specialized to keep up with the
pace of A.I. development.

While a naturaland necessary partof the A.I. development process,such a
trend toward specialized hardware does increase the fixed costsrequired
to be competitive. This cost manifests not only in theexpense of these
systems, but in the elaborate supplychains that have been built up to
supportthem. While the policy recommendations that flow out of this
insight are less clearcut than those for the supply of A.I. analysts
ordatasets, maintaining access to valuable A.I. hardware is a key policy
consideration.

Avoid Political Instability inInternational Supply Chains

As A.I. hardware becomes more specialized, the supply chainsfor very
specific chips become a critical ingredient for cutting-edgeML research.
While the United States maintains advanced manufacturing facilities that
are vitalto the supply chain, much of the production for particularparts
(like back-end semiconductor fabrication) have been outsourced. Given
the importance of chip foundries in Taiwan andChina in particular, the
perceived stability of trade in the regionwill alter investment
patternsand domestic accessto these sophisticated chips.

To ensure accessin spite of political tensions, large companies suchas
Apple, Google,and Nvidia are beginning to re-shore production of
especially valuable chips. Smaller competitors and startups,however, are
much more limitedin this capacityand thus are more relianton existing
international supply chains.

Insofar as recent U.S. trade tensions with Chinahave increased the
perceived instability of regional trade, thedisparate impact this
instability will have on smaller firms should berecognized.

Ultimately, new foundries andsemiconductor manufacturing plantswill
shift wherever they are most profitable. Accordingly, in the event of a
long-term trade war, production could eventuallyshift elsewhere.
Tradetensions, however, willcertainly shape short-and medium-term
accessto specialized hardware.

Maintain a Healthy Ecosystem AroundDistributed Platforms

The other significant trend in A.I. hardware utilization is the growthof
cloud-computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS)and the
GoogleCloud platform. Cloudcomputing has notable pro-competitive effects
in that it transforms what is normallya fixed costin server capacity
into a variable one.Allowing a startupto buy onlythe discrete
serverspace they willneed for thatmonth significantly reduces the amount
of venture capitalneeded to get a companyoff the ground.

This becomes even more important asA.I. hardware becomes more
specialized. Requiring a startup to buy differentchips for the various
life cycles of training and operating an ML algorithmwould be a
significant financial outlay and almost certainly hurt the abilityof
startups to compete.

Fortunately, both AWS and GoogleCloud have been competing with one
another by adding

specialized A.I. hardware as a part of theirplatform offerings. This
offering essentially allows startups to spread out theincreased fixed
costs of specialized hardware over a longer time horizon, whichmakes it
more manageable.

In addition to the physical servers themselves,cloud computing companies
are increasingly offering ML services suchas voice recognition,
translation, and imagerecognition to savestartups the hassle of building
theirown software tools for each discrete task. Again, it is difficult
to understate how much easierthis makes the process of launching a
startup, and it is a very positivedevelopment for the overall healthof
the A.I. ecosystem.

As this portion of the ecosystem largely seems tobe developing in a
healthy manner, the United States should be careful to avoid
data-localization laws, excessive privacylaws, and otherlegislative
efforts that mightdisrupt the carefulbalance. On the whole,
recommendations for this areashould largely follow the Hippocratic Oath
and "First,do no harm."

What About Antitrust?

It is worth contrasting this general approach ofreducing barriers to
entry with another commonly cited remedy: strongerantitrust
enforcement.While concern over the level of domestic competition faced
by large tech firmsis, of course, not unique to A.I., it has certainly
raised the stakes given howcentral the technology is to their current
and future business models.

Traditional antitrust measures, however, may proveto be both fairly
difficult to implement and high risk for dealing with thisperceived
problem. After all, there are many plausible arguments supporting the
current consolidated structure of the A.I. industry, particularly those
thatemphasize the importance of cross-cutting technical expertise,and
the ability to leverage data and services from one business application
to another.

If critics are right, breaking up or activelyrestricting the
mergeractivities of largetech firms could lead to more innovation in the
long run. If these companies are indeed leveraging their
significantmarket power to make it harder for startups to compete with
them, breaking themup or constraining them could be a remedy.

If critics are wrong aboutthe optimal marketstructure of A.I.development
and strongantitrust action is pursued,however, the consequences could be
dire.An increasing amountof evidence suggests thata small sliverof firms
on the technological frontier have beenresponsible for the lion's share
of productivity gainsin the economy. Breaking up these largetech firms
potentially risks killing the goose that lays the golden egg.

By contrast, focusing on lower barriers to entry isa fairly low-risk
strategy for injecting more competition into the A.I.landscape. If the
United Statescan make it easier forstartups to compete against large,
established incumbents, it increases the likelihood of achieving the
boosts to

dynamism and innovation that antitrust advocateschampion. Further, it
would do so without risking the destruction of thecurrent market
equilibrium that is producing significant gains for consumers and for
thebroader economy. If incumbents can withstand the Schumpeterian
windsof increased competition from startups, it is all the betterfor
them.

As this essaysuggests, there are significant barriersto entry in A.I.
development that have boosted the market power of incumbentfirms. If, in
the absence of these barriers, new startups can successfullycompete, it
will be a win for innovation, consumers and for the dynamism of
theeconomy as a whole. To ensure a competitive and innovative ecosystem
goingforward, policymakers should prioritize reducing the barriersto
entry as our first line of defense.

These founders took the road less travelled to reap rewards

Body

New Delhi, Dec. 14 -- The Silicon Valley venture capital (VC) model
followed around the world has an investment thesis skewed towards
finding mega winners. The acquisition of Flipkart for $18 billion by
Walmart in 2018 gave its early backer Accel India a manifold return that
more than made up for any "failures" of other startups in its portfolio.
A Facebook initial public offering in 2012 gave the California VC a
reported 1,000-fold return on its $12.7 million investment seven years
earlier.

While such stories hog the headlines, there's many a tale of a startup
fallen by the wayside in this quest for a "hockey stick" growth
trajectory. While a VC focuses on the top 10% of its startups that can
scale fast by pumping capital into marketing and expansion, others come
under pressure to meet growth expectations that may not suit their
startups.

This has prompted a new breed of startup founders who push back against
such a model. And supporting them are alternative VCs like Indie.vc,
TinySeed and Earnest Capital that are positioned to back founders aiming
for modest revenue-led growth rather than being rocketships.

The classic case is that of San Francisco-based Gumroad, whose founder
Sahil Lavingia raised millions of dollars from top-tier VCs when he was
19 years old. After a couple of years, growth stalled. The business was
still going up, "but we were venture-funded, which was like playing a
game of double or nothing", wrote Lavingia in a blog post.

To cut a long story short, Gumroad got written off by its lead VCs, but
Lavingia stayed the course to build a profitable company that creates
value for its users, without measuring his success in terms of becoming
a unicorn in valuation.

Alternative path

Many SaaS (software-as-a-service) startups out of India making a dent in
global markets are similarly drawn towards this alternative path. "You
don't need a lot of venture capital to build a software product.
Go-to-market (GTM) is where it gets expensive and that's where large VC
rounds are raised. In our case, we decided we could not afford a
marketing-led GTM. We wanted a product-led GTM," says Vijay Rayapati,
founder of Minjar in Bengaluru, which got acquired in 2018 by US-based
Nutanix for an undisclosed amount, rumoured to be around $50 million.
The total funding it had raised was $2 million.

Rayapati was influenced by an article he read early on in his startup
journey that began in 2013. It made the point that a founder who raises
$2 million and sells a company for $30 million often makes the same
amount of money as a founder who raises $40-50 million and sells a
company for $200 million. "I didn't believe in raising a lot of venture
capital because then you would have to show high growth, which puts
pressure," he explains.

"A VC can have a portfolio of 50 companies and he would always put
pressure on growth. It doesn't matter so much to a VC if one company
works out or not as long as he gets a few big winners in his portfolio.
But for you as a founder, this is the only thing you are doing."

Another Bengaluru SaaS startup that eschewed VC funding was
Recruiterbox. The HR tech company was bootstrapped through its
seven-year journey to profitable growth before being sold to San
Francisco-based Turn/River Capital in 2018 for an undisclosed amount.

"As with a lot of B2B (business-to-business) SaaS, we were very quick to
get revenue. We were basically reinvesting our revenue into the
business. We deliberated raising funds but we were not convinced we had
the right strategy," recalls Raj Sheth, who was Recruiterbox's
co-founder and CEO.

Around three years into its journey, Recruiterbox got an angel investor
in Freeman Murray, a tech entrepreneur who co-founded Jaaga as a
collaborative space for the artist and techie communities in Bengaluru.

Murray agreed to provide capital as debt instead of taking equity
because Recruiterbox already had enough revenue to show by then.
Recruiterbox needed the debt to fuel its growth and Murray's
contribution was handy at a time when loans for startups were not
readily available.

Better options

That has changed. Venture debt from the likes of Alteria, Innoven and
Trifecta was available for startups that had raised series A or later
stage funding. Now, entities like Startuploan have brought venture debt
to even the pre-series A stage for startups reluctant to dilute their
equity too much.

There are different derisking models at such an early stage. GetVantage,
for example, provides revenue-based financing but restricts the usage of
the debt to sales and marketing where return on investment can be
tracked. Startuploan provides unrestricted debt but takes a small equity
stake.

"We typically give three to four times the monthly revenue of a startup
as the loan amount. It varies from Rs.20 lakh to Rs.1 crore," says Hari
Krishnan, co-founder of Startuploan, which has invested in 19
early-stage startups so far.

May 13 -- In the growing catalog of EV automakers that have launched in
recent years, Rivian is perhaps the buzziest.

The company's two all-electric vehicles, the R1S SUV and R1T pickup,
have captured the attention of consumers and the media. Rivian has wooed
a high-profile list of investors, including Coatue, Fidelity Management
and Research Company, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T.
Rowe Price Associates Inc. And then there's Amazon, which not only backs
Rivian, it's also a customer that has ordered 100,000 electric
commercial vans.

But it wasn't until Rivian made its debut as a publicly traded company
last November that the attention and scrutiny launched into the
stratosphere. And right in the middle of the rapid growth and three
vehicle launches, production bottlenecks and supply chain constraints,
accolades and factory expansions is founder and CEO RJ Scaringe.

 

We're excited to announce that Scaringe will join us on stage at
TechCrunch Disrupt, our annual conference that brings together the best
and brightest minds in tech and a global startup community. TC Disrupt,
which is back as an in-person event, will be held October 18 to October
20 at the Moscone West Convention Center followed by an online recap
event on October 21.

Scaringe will join us in person for a wide-ranging interview that will
cover the startup's early failures and successes, Rivian's progress and
quest to become a vertically integrated company and plans for the future
as well as his insights on the wave of EVs coming to market, battery
tech and automated driving.

TC Disrupt will feature three days of interviews with founders,
investors and some of the most interesting leaders and experts in
climate tech, consumer tech, crypto, entertainment, enterprise software,
hardware and robotics, security, science, space and transportation. As
always, TC Disrupt is the place for startup founders from all over the
world to come together and connect, meet investors, media and potential

How one Pakistani techie helped build a $20 million

The Financial Post (Pakistan)

October 21, 2019 Monday

Copyright 2019 Daily Financial Post All Rights Reserved

Length: 1681 words

Dateline: Islamabad

Body

Islamabad, Oct. 21 -- Many startups do not even pass the first or second
year of their existence. And if they somehow do pass this phase, well,
it was just their honeymoon period. Everything looks great at the time,
your idea seems to be working, you might even have your first few
customers and people might be wanting to join your team. But once you
pass that phase and the startup becomes a business, that is when it
becomes difficult to sustain, grow and succeed.

Fahad Aziz is the co-founder and chief technical officer of healthcare
company CareAxiom, a subsidiary of US based company Caremerge, with
offices in Chicago, San Francisco and Lahore. It was founded in 2012,
and provides web and mobile-based solutions to improve coordinating care
for senior citizens. It was named one of the fastest growing companies
in the US by Inc5000 last year, and currently serves over 100,000 senior
citizens.

How CareAxiom became a high-growth startup is a story of its own. Like
all successful ventures, their journey had its period of tribulations.
But one defining factor that allowed CareAxiom to achieve high growth
was that they were able to raise investment whenever required.

"You can grow organically but that is much slower. You have to raise
money to grow. In the last five years, we [CareAxiom] raised $20 million
in funding from various investors. This, however, was not a one-time
effort. It was an ongoing process. We raised $500,000 at first, then we
did $2 million, and then $4 million, $14 million and so on," says Fahad.

He was speaking to Profit at a tech summit organised by CareAxiom and
Open Lahore at Lahore's Arfa Karim Tower - the same building that houses
Plan9, the Punjab government's incubation center for startups.

In his quest to raise investment for CareAxiom, Fahad sat in multiple
sessions with over 135 investors. That precious time spent in
fundraising rounds has given him an insight into what investors are
looking for. He outlined four crucial aspects to Profit that make or
break an investor's interest in any startup.

The Team

The investor looks at the team's ability to deliver on what they are
promising. And that requires the team members to complement one another.
Investors are watching out for any overlap in the team members' skills,
and will instead go for a team that possesses a diverse skill set.

"If you have two co-founders and both of them are technical [persons],
it may not go very well [with the investor]. A technical co-founder and
another one who has a business acumen would go rather well since the
skill sets are diverse. Same would be true for someone in the team who
has a background in marketing. They need to complement each other,"
Fahad says.

According to him, investors are keen observers. They can decode the body
language of a team and look for signs about whether the team has any
contradictions among its members, or whether a team member negates what
is said by his peers.

"They [the investors] want to make sure that those who are presenting
before them can work together. They are looking at your body language.
That you are not negating each other, not interrupting each other's
conversation. This first conversation with the investors is going to
tell them whether the team members are doers or will simply waste the
money," he adds.

The Product

"Your product has to be good, it has to be unique, it has to be 10 times
better than what is in the market," says Fahad.

If you want investors drooling over the money your startup could
potentially earn them, just a good product won't cut it (unless you are
building something that doesn't exist just yet). But if you are debuting
in a market where there is already some competition, it is ideal that
you build something that is at least 10 times better, and has the
potential to significantly grow.

For instance, if you tell a potential investor that you are entering the
ride-sharing startup space with a Careem or Uber-like app, you'll only
look absurd while pitching that idea. Copying the same model won't cut
it. Of course, unless your investor is Softbank or something similar,
and you have an idea so appealing that your investors can't resist,
they'll probably still think twice before investing in your ride-sharing
startup. Uber and Careem are established competitors, while your startup
is on a shoestring.

"If you are building something that is already in the market and your
solution is one or two times better, that might not go very well. It
needs to have something that really affects that, so it has to be 10
times better," says Fahad.

In short, don't build if you can't build the best.

The Market

"If you are building a technology, you want to make sure it can grow,"
says Fahad. "You are building a great product, but what if your market
size is too small?" he questions.

The size of a market is an indicator of how much your startup can grow.
Investors simply won't spend money on a startup if they don't see a
potential for growth, unless your investors are philanthropists that
seek no return.

Safwan Khan, the founder of Xgrid, an Islamabad-based tech firm, said
that if you are building a product that has a market of millions of
people, you are looking at a billion-dollar company, but if your market
is of 10 people, you can't achieve anything.

Let's say you are a budding entrepreneur. You want to solve a problem in
Pakistan, because let's face it, we have a lot of them. You are also an
educationist at heart, so you want to solve a problem in the field of
education. You have identified a problem and you build an application -
a solution that allows doctoral candidates to do, let's say, research
more efficiently.

You have built a great product, but will you be able to grow it? Or put
it this way how much can you scale it?

The answer is obvious. No matter how amazing your product is, your
target market is too small. Pakistan only produces a few thousand
doctoral candidates every year, making it extremely unlikely that an
investor would be interested.

"You are better off building an application for students who are in
matriculation," says Fahad.

Traction

Probably the most important component investors look at is traction.
It's one of the main reasons behind the failure of most startups. Fahad
believes traction is often an afterthought for most startups.

What defines traction? Traction is having a measurable set of customers
or users that can tell the progress of a startup. Every startup's
traction is different; for some, it is revenue, or how much how much
money a startup is making. In some cases, it is about engagement can you
continue to engage your users over time?

This is what investors love, says Fahad. They want to participate in
your startup so that they can get a return on their investment, which is
why your startup needs to have some traction.

There are a lot of misconceptions among startups [about what user
engagement means], he says.

"It might mean the number of people downloading an application. That is
a good matrix, but not good enough. For some people it can be that how
many people are signing up on their application and registering on it. A
good matrix but still not good enough. It has to be something that is a
core action that you want them [users] to perform. And you need to
measure on that core action. That's what grows the business and that is
what brings value to the user. Downloading an application or registering
on your application, sadly, is not good enough," he says.

Let's understand what these core actions can be. For Google, that core
action is 'googling'. They want more and more people to google and they
make it very easy for the users to do it. For Careem, that core action
is booking, not just downloading the application and registering. The
more rides you as a user book, the better it is for Careem's business.
For Twitter, this core action is tweeting. For Youtube, it is about
generating content.

In all of these cases, the core action should be the easiest to perform.
Tweeting is hassle-free and uploading a video on Youtube is relatively
seamless.

It is for this reason startups offer free goodies to prompt users to
initiate these core actions on their applications to increase their user
base. Airlift, a ride-sharing startup, offers five free rides to
customers using it for the first time. By offering these free rides,
Airlift is is increasing its user base ie. it's initial traction. It is
pulling customers to perform the core action that forms the basis of its
traction booking rides. For comparison, Airlift does not offer free
rides on downloading the application or creating an account with them.

"The first problem, which is very difficult for the startup to figure
out, is what is their core action. Then there is the 'leaky bucket'.
That is what if you have people who do the core action but never come
back," says Fahad.

"We need to stop that and that is the next step retaining your user
base. There are two ways to do that. One is by giving so many benefits
to the user that they don't want to leave. You have to get your users to
when they use your system, they benefit from it so much, they use it
more and more and more," he says.

Does that ring a bell? Every now and then Uber and Careem offer
discounts to its existing customers. Why? To retain their customers, of
course.

Secondly, says Fahad, you need to build enough value around your product
so that the more consumers use it, the harder it is for them to leave.

"An example of this is Evernote. It allows you to take notes. But more
than taking notes, it allows you to send your PDF files and emails. It
becomes a repository of all your documents. Imagine losing all your
documents. But then you remember there is a repository where these are
safe and you can find these documents there. It would be impossible to
stop using it. There is so much accruing benefit that leaving is not a
choice anymore," he says.

This repulsive app generates nudes from photos of clothed women

June 28 -- If you think creating anyone's nude photos or deepfake was a
difficult task, think again. An app called DeepNude has developed a
scary AI that can create a nude picture out of a woman's fully clothed
photo.

First reported by Vice, the Windows and Linux app was launched in March.
DeepNude can take any clothed photo of a woman and turn into a realistic
nude picture using its AI.

The app is free to download and try, but you'll need to pay $50 for the
ability to remove its large watermark and export the results. It works
offline and requires a 155MB download, as well as 2.1GB of additional
files for its libraries before you can use it.

We tried the free version of the app with a few pictures, and it worked
to some degree (full-length dresses threw the app for a loop). But the
results are sometimes enough for bad actors to use to harass people.

The unnamed creator of the app told Vice that the AI is based on the
Pix2Pix algorithm developed by researchers from the University of
California, Berkeley, that turns black and white images into color
images. He trained the model with over 10,000 images of nude women, and
is hoping to create a male version of this as well.

He told the publication that he created the app out of curiosity and
just for "fun":

I'm not a voyeur, I'm a technology enthusiast. Continuing to improve the
algorithm. Recently, also due to previous failures (other startups) and
economic problems, I asked myself if I could have an economic return
from this algorithm. That's why I created DeepNude.

The creator defended himself saying that anyone can do this with few
tutorials of Photoshop. But from his statement, it appears that he isn't
cognizant of the fact that this could allow people to harm women by
manipulating their photos far more easily than ever before. We've sent
an email to DeepNude to learn more about the algorithm and its
intentions.

Deepfakes have been around for a couple of years, and mainly to create
porn videos featuring women and celebrities. We've recently covered
advancements in this field that allows you to edit a video just by
altering the transcript or create a talking head video using only one
image.

Despite researchers claiming that new algorithms will help professionals
in various ways, examples like DeepNude show that right now, it's
causing more harm and chaos than benefiting the world.

Update: Readers correctly identified we should not have been linking to
this awful, awful app. That was irresponsible. We've removed the links,
scrubbed the cache, and very much regret the error.

Pakistan startups, the last massive untapped opportunity in the world

The Pakistan Monument in Islamabad

On August 25, 2021, a tweet by Mattias Martinsson, Chief Investment
Officer at Tundra Fonder, a Swedish asset manager specialising in
frontier markets, drew the attention of many.

'Have followed Pakistan for 15 years. Can't recall any time when VC
activity was anywhere near [that] we've seen in the last few months.
Impact of reforms kicking in?', he tweeted.

The tweet, which referred to the record amounts of venture funding being
poured into Pakistan in 2021, well captured the changing market
sentiment.

And this positive sentiment could, well, mark a new dawn for the Islamic
republic's startup ecosystem.

However, the picture was totally different until three-four years ago.
Pakistan, plagued by security concerns for many years, had not been a
preferred destination for foreign VCs. The unrest in neighbouring
Afghanistan, following its invasion by a US-led coalition in the 2000s,
had ripples in Pakistan. Consequently, the country faced several massive
terrorist attacks. Its unpredictable and unstable political system added
to the woes.

This precariousness scared away global investors from investing in the
nation.

While Pakistan was struggling to check the growing terrorist activities
and shed its image as an insecure nation, its arch-rival India was
marching ahead, attracting billions of dollars in VC money. India, whose
digitisation[1] rate grew fast in the recent years, also minted around
100 unicorns[2] in the last 10-plus years, whereas Pakistan produced
none.

Finding the feet

After two decades of uncertainty and confusion, Pakistan's tech startup
ecosystem appears to have finally found its feet — if the growing VC
activity is any indicator. In 2021, a record US$352 million was raised
by more than 50 local startups, statistics[3] by consulting agency
Invest2Innovate[4] (i2i) showed. To put this in context, local startups
secured only US$465 million between 2016 and 2021 (see the graph).

What made the 2021 boom more exciting was that a big chunk of the
dollars came from international investors. Among them were notable VCs,
such as Kleiner Perkins (the US), Defy Partners Management (the US),
Wavemaker Partners (Singapore), and Zayn Capital (UAE).

The kind of VC money invested in 2022 so far also brings cheers to the
ecosystem. In the first three-month period, startups secured 7x as much
investment[5] as in Q1 last year, with names such as Indus Valley
Capital, Defy Partners, Acrew Capital, Wavemaker Partners, B&Y Venture
Partners, and Zayn Capital injecting capital.

Many factors are attributed to this investor confidence. The primary
reason is the improved security situation; the number of terror-related
incidents in the nationhas dropped in recent years[7]. An improved
digital infrastructure also worked in its favour. Pakistan, with a
population of 228 million[8], had 82.90 million (about 36.5 per cent)
internet users as of January 2022.

Besides, Pakistan recently introduced[9] new reforms to become more
startup-friendly.The previous PTI government, led by Imran Khan,realised
the importance of startups [10]to the country's economic growth and
wanted it to be a hub for new businesses, along the lines of Silicon
Valley. The government had also been very responsive to the growing
startup ecosystem and instituted several policies from 'tax holidays'
through special zones to regularising holding companies to creating
fintech licenses.

In February this year, the government also established[11] Pakistan
Technology Startup Fund worth one billion rupees (US$5.4 million) to
provide seed financing to 50 startups annually.

In addition to these initiatives, the central bank, the SBP, introduced
new legislation that[12]allows international investors to invest in an
entity registered in a foreign land but has operations in Pakistan (it
was disallowed earlier).

The reforms also included a legal framework for Electronic Money
Institutions (aimed at offering innovative payment services to the
general public), the Digital Banking Policy (aimed at granting the
license to set up wholly digital banks), and the setting up of Special
Technology Zones.

With all this in place, Pakistan now has an active startup ecosystem,
with many incubators and accelerators[13], including i2i, the National
Incubation Centers, Nest IO, Plan 9, and Plan X. Several co-working
places like COLABS, Daftarkhawan, and The Hive have also emerged
recently.

Many early-stage VCs and angel networks are also operational in the
nation. The names include CresVentures, DotZero, Planet N, Lakson
Investments, Fatima Ventures, Deosai Ventures, 47 Ventures, i2i
Ventures, HBL ventures, Indus Valley Capital, Virtual Force, Karavan,
Zayn Capital, Walled City Co.

According to Kalsoom Lakhani,[14]Co-Founder and General Partner of i2i
Ventures (the US$15-million VC arm of i2i), the pace at which things are
moving in Pakistan right now is probably 20x faster than she had ever
seen. Moreover, the time between two successive financing rounds is also
getting shorter, she says.

As a result of the changing business environment, many foreign-educated
young Pakistanis have started quitting their overseas plum jobs at MNCs
like Morgan Stanley and McKinsey to set up their own ventures back home.
For instance, Aatif Awan, with over a decade working for tech behemoths
such as LinkedIn, came back in early 2020 to launch his own VC firm
Indus Valley Capital[15]. This early-stage VC firm has already backed
eight companies, including Bazaar (a B2B e-commerce marketplace, which
recently secured US$70M[16] in a Series B round) and Airlift (a quick
commerce startup that bagged US$85M[17] in Series B in 2021).

According to Awan, Pakistan now has all the necessary ingredients[18] to
grow — quality startups, a critical mass of internet users, and smart VC
money. It is geographically smaller and well-connected, with fewer
provinces. Regulatory barriers are also lower.

All these factors have attracted foreign VCs to Pakistan — the last big
untapped market globally.

However, the road ahead is still more than bumpy for local startups.

Lack of exits a problem

As startups make waves and put their names on the global map, new
problems worry the ecosystem. They include lack of access to
growth-stage capital[19] and reluctance among people to open bank
accounts (about 100 million adults don't have access[20] to formal and
regulated financial services).

As for exits, the higher valuation of startups is a common concern for
many investors. This effectively closes the possible exit routes for
startups. According to Suleman Rafiq Maniya (Head of Advisory) at Vector
Securities, it may be hard for VCs to get an exit through the stock
market because the valuations of startups are higher compared to listed
companies.

Exit through acquisitions is also scarce, likely discouraging investors
from investing further in local startups. Barring Alibaba's
acquisition[21] of Daraz and Ant Group's buying of a 45 per cent
stake[22] in Telenor's EasyPaisa in 2018, there have not been any major
exits in the past three years. Awan says that the market is still too
early for material exits, and it will take the ecosystem a few years for
more substantial exits to materialise.

The Pakistan Startup Ecosystem Report 2021[23]by i2i warns that if
foreign VCs don't see clear long-term prospects locally, they may desist
from cutting bigger cheques or making strategic investments.

The Series A and growth-stage capital crunch also poses a problem to
Pakistan like any other emerging ecosystem. 'There is a lot that a
government can do here but I think it is the private sector that should
take the lead here. The government can ensure a fair playing field. For
that reason, early-stage Pakistani VCs should take the lead to fill the
gap. If they fill this gap, they will be able to attract foreign VCs,'
says Taraec Hussein, an investor with Gobi Partners, one of the most
active VCs in Pakistan.

What future holds for Pakistan

Indus Valley's Awan believes that the momentum that Pakistani startups
gained in H1 2021 will continue in 2022. More top investors, including
traditional and cross-border VC funds, will come to invest in Pakistan.
Global accelerators like Y Combinator and 500 Global will also double
down on local startups.

'The Pakistani startup ecosystem has had a late start, but it's taking
off quickly. The year 2021 saw more VC funding than all prior years
combined, and 2022 seems on track to more than double that. By 2025, the
VC funding in Pakistan is projected to exceed US$2 billion annually. In
the next three-five years, several unicorns will be minted in Pakistan
across B2C e-commerce, B2B e-commerce, logistics, and fintech,' believes
Awan.

led by Uber investor First Round Capital[24]

'We expect the new government to continue with startup-friendly
policies. There is broad recognition across the political spectrum on
tech being the major driver of foreign direct investment (FDI) and
exports, so all parties recognise the importance of investing in the
tech ecosystem,' Awan shares.

Conrurrs Gobi's Hussein: 'Venture capitalis now a key economic pillar of
any country and for that reason, it will be extremely foolish for the
new government to pull back some of the reforms brought by the previous
government. Also, there is so much buzz, interest and hype around VCs
and entrepreneurship, founders and startups in Pakistan.'

However, Awan warns that there will be some failures in the local
startup scene. 'As more and more startups get early-stage funding, the
founders will realise that capital isn't the hardest part of building a
great company. Finding product-market fit is hard. Building a
world-class team is hard. Competing with multiple well-funded startups
and going after the same market is hard.'

Some startups may scale to a certain level but then fail to go past that
thanks to any of the reasons mentioned above. It is not a bad thing but
is actually a positive thing for the ecosystem. 'Because in the long
run, people will learn from these experiences and go on to build
something bigger and better,' Awan concludes.

Escape from the lab! 6 promising biotech startup companies profiled at
ASU symposium

US Official News

Arizona: Arizona State University has issued the following press
release: Arizona State University's many laboratories are seedbeds for
an astonishing variety of new ideas. But the path from basic research to
real-world applications can be complex, perilous and — sometimes —
bewildering. A recent all-day seminar hosted at the Biodesign Institute
explored an array of promising research that has escaped the confines of
the lab. New spinout companies, based on groundbreaking research, are
bringing exciting innovations in the life sciences to market. The
gathering was organized by the ASU Biotechnology Advisory Board, a
consortium consisting of national and international industry leaders in
the biotech domain.

The board’s role is to explore opportunities for students in the various
biomedical fields as well as gauge the impact of biotech research across
ASU. High risks and high rewards The biotechnology sector is a high
stakes world, in which billions of dollars can be made or lost overnight
and the landscape is littered with the bones of failed biotech ventures.
Company leaders must be nimble and ready to abandon strategies that
don’t work while being ever mindful of the company’s vision, goals and
overall approach. The promise of stratospheric profits, coupled with
dreams of making significant contributions to human health and societal
betterment have driven a gold rush in biotechnology. Currently, the
number of biotech IPOs is exploding and the winners have been among the
best-performing in the market. So much for the good news: The fact is,
the rate of failure of tech startups in general is around 75 percent
according to Fast Company Magazine, and biotech startups face many
challenges unique to the industry. Today, potential investors are often
wary after some biotech companies received extravagant valuations only
to come crashing down. While a few flame out in spectacular public
manner — Theranos perhaps representing the most extreme and unsettling
case — most die quieter deaths as a result of insufficient funding,
errors in management or poor navigation of the enormous practical
hurdles involved. Products and innovations that may carry lethal risks
must undergo extravagant vetting relative to most other products
entering the marketplace, creating a landscape of exceptional complexity
and risk for biotech companies. Team members savvy in the byzantine
world of regulatory law are often required assets for successful teams.
In the biotech universe, timing is everything. Decisions that can make
or break startups include when to interest larger biotech or pharma
conglomerates in licensing some of your technology or buying your
company outright. An unusual blend of optimism, aggressive perseverance
and practicality are among the essential ingredients. When is it
appropriate to tackle roadblocks and when should companies cut their
losses for a promising idea that faces too many setbacks? Success
requires a perfect storm of pathbreaking science, societal need, strong
leadership in a variety of areas and adequacy of funding. On the other
hand, the best ideas hold the potential to radically transform human
health and improve the quality of life for millions of people around the
world. Taking research to the market The seminar kicked off with a
discussion moderated by Professor Bert Jacobs, director of the School of
Life Sciences, titled "Targeting Educational Goals to Fit Industry."
Next, Professor Neal Woodbury, director of the School of Molecular
Sciences, moderated a discussion on bioindustry challenges and
academia’s response. Seed funding for new startups and the ins and outs
of venture capital investment were explored. One challenge common to
most biotech startups is presentation: how to package and offer up
enough of the salient science to entice potential investors without
overwhelming them with minutiae. Protection of sensitive intellectual
property, especially for companies seeking to break into the vast
markets in China, can also be a critical consideration. The afternoon
session featured rapid-fire descriptions of six new biotech startups, as
members of the local business community peppered the presenters with
questions and suggestions for furthering the success of these ventures:
NanoPin NanoPin is a company founded in 2017 by Tony Hu, a researcher in
the Biodesign Virginia G. Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics.
Their proprietary technology, described by NanoPin CEO Thomas Tombler,
uses a nanoparticle-based platform, coupled with high-throughput mass
spectroscopy to detect and quantitate disease biomarkers in patient
blood samples. Specifically, Nanopin addresses the urgent need for more
accurate, cost-effective diagnostic tools for tuberculosis, a deadly
disease estimated to affect some 10 million people worldwide and cause
1.7 million annual deaths. TB can be difficult to diagnose using
conventional methods, particularly in children and “paucibacillary”
cases in which the abundance of mycobacterium — causative agent of the
disease — is very low. Speed is also a critical component. The current
gold standard diagnostic can take six to eight weeks to yield a final
result, as opposed to NanoPin’s rapid diagnostic. The versatile platform
holds the promise for rapid diagnosis of a range of diseases. NanoPin
recently received $2 million in seed funding to develop this diagnostic
and monitoring platform for tuberculosis management. Calviri Improved
cancer treatment and prevention are the focus of Stephen Albert
Johnston’s startup company Calviri. Johnston is the director for the
Center for Innovations in Medicine and a professor in the School of Life
Sciences. The company presentation, delivered by Douglas Thamm, director
of clinical programs, described the use of peptide array technology to
screen for cancer. Existing methods for analyzing tumor diversity in
sequence data can take months. Further, the radical heterogeneity of
many mutations found in cancerous tumors require time-consuming and
exorbitant personalized therapies or vaccine designs. Calviri’s
technology focuses on net-antigens, mutations that may be common to a
broader range of cancer cases than the so-called neo-antigens that have
been studied by the cancer community. By contrast, net-antigens are
reduced through transcription and RNA splicing, producing highly
immunogenic errors. Use of such net-antigens could enable faster,
simpler, and less expensive methods for the production of personal
cancer vaccines and perhaps one day, even a generally used cancer
vaccine. ASU was awarded $6.4M multiyear grant from the Open
Philanthropy Project to test preventive cancer vaccine for dogs. OncoMyx
Therapeutics Grant McFadden, director of the Biodesign Center for
Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, presented details of his
company OncoMyx Therapeutics. The spinout has leveraged McFadden’s
research in virology to develop technologies targeting hematologic and
solid tumors with a unique oncolytic virus called myxoma (MYXV) and a
novel patented systemic delivery approach. Myxoma is a standout in the
viral world, a pathogen found exclusively in rabbits, where its presence
is rapidly lethal. The company, however, is interested in another
property of myxoma: its effectiveness as an oncolytic or anticancer
agent in humans. Myxoma, a member of the pox virus family, is highly
immunostimulatory, and is nonpathogenic in any organism outside of
rabbits. The virus has a unique ability to be carried systemically by
human leukocytes where it can then infect tumor cells. OncoMyx will
spearhead the next-stage development plans of oncolytic myxoma virus to
seek FDA approval and conduct the first human clinical trials, using
their patented systemic delivery approach. The company will capitalize
on McFadden’s two decades of research into the potential of oncolytic
viruses. Professor McFadden sequenced the myxoma virus genome in 1999
and since then has produced dozens of genetically engineered constructs,
demonstrating its ability as an oncolytic agent across many tumors in
preclinical cell and animal models. FlexBioTech, Inc FlexBioTech, Inc is
another cancer-focused biotech startup co-founded by CEO and physician
scientist Karen Anderson, a researcher in the Biodesign Virginia G.
Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics. In addition to her role as a
translational cancer researcher at Biodesign, Anderson holds a joint
appointment as a breast cancer medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic Arizona
and professor in the School of Life Sciences, focused on tumor
immunology, vaccine development and biomarker development. She has
developed clinical immune biomarkers for clinical use (Videssa Breast,
Provista Diagnostics) and in clinical trials (HPV biomarkers, used in
the HOUSTON trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center), and point of care
diagnostics (in development for cervical cancer detection in India).
FlexBioTech focuses on point-of-care biomarker detection. The technology
permits rapid, low-cost home biomarker detection on a mobile platform
that transmits results to hospitals and physicians. Gemneo Bioscience
Joseph Blattman is an immunologist who studies how the immune system
responds to vaccination and viral infection. He is a researcher in the
Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy. Blattman’s
company, Gemneo Bioscience, is the 100th spinout company formed at ASU.
Gemneo’s mission is to provide physicians with more optimal cancer
treatments and groundbreaking immunotherapies to help improve cancer
outcomes. The company is developing innovative molecular-based
single-cell genomics technology that does not require cell sorting,
which will greatly accelerate the speed and decrease the costs of
analyzing the genomic heterogeneity of cancer and immune tissues,
microbiomes, and beyond. Gemneo’s mission is to rapidly put their
technology in the hands of academic and pharma industry researchers, to
advance the frontiers of precision medicine, reduce costs and improve
patient outcomes. The research on DNA origami nanoprobes for single-cell
multi-gene analysis and single-cell analysis of tumor heterogeneity was
funded by NIH grants and is an excellent example of federally-funded
research leading to advances in science and medicine. Gemneo’s platform
technology can be used to profile cancer genomics and identify rare
cells that influence disease progression that current technologies are
not able to detect. Attometrics The burgeoning field of aging research
has given rise to Wayne Frasch’s startup biotech company, Attometrics,
which has developed technologies for evaluating telomere length.
Telomeres — structures adorning the ends of chromosomes, have been
implicated in not only the aging process but as signposts of disease.
Certain cancer cells, for example, display unusually long telomeres
believed to be linked with these cells’ status as immortal entities
engaged in unchecked replication, the hallmark of cancer. Telomeres,
therefore, may provide an intriguing and powerful new means of cancer
diagnosis. Attometrics technology can quickly and accurately compute the
length of telomeres at the ends of human chromosomes. Due to the strong
correlation between telomere length and many age-related diseases and
cancers, there has been an urgent need to develop a reproducible
telomere length assay. Frasch, a researcher at the School of Life
Sciences, is a pioneer in single-molecule nanotechnology, using this
knowledge to create molecular motor-powered nanodevices that serve as a
platform technology capable of quickly detecting target biomarkers for
disease that are present in extremely low amounts. All of the
participants received lively feedback from business experts during
seminar discussions, helping to bring their visions to life and improve
the chances for company success in a demanding but uniquely rewarding
business landscape. In case of any query regarding this article or other

Arizona: Arizona State University has issued the following press
release: Arizona State University's many laboratories are seedbeds for
an astonishing variety of new ideas. But the path from basic research to
real-world applications can be complex, perilous and — sometimes —
bewildering. A recent all-day seminar hosted at the Biodesign Institute
explored an array of promising research that has escaped the confines of
the lab. New spinout companies, based on groundbreaking research, are
bringing exciting innovations in the life sciences to market. The
gathering was organized by the ASU Biotechnology Advisory Board, a
consortium consisting of national and international industry leaders in
the biotech domain.

The board’s role is to explore opportunities for students in the various
biomedical fields as well as gauge the impact of biotech research across
ASU. High risks and high rewards The biotechnology sector is a high
stakes world, in which billions of dollars can be made or lost overnight
and the landscape is littered with the bones of failed biotech ventures.
Company leaders must be nimble and ready to abandon strategies that
don’t work while being ever mindful of the company’s vision, goals and
overall approach. The promise of stratospheric profits, coupled with
dreams of making significant contributions to human health and societal
betterment have driven a gold rush in biotechnology. Currently, the
number of biotech IPOs is exploding and the winners have been among the
best-performing in the market. So much for the good news: The fact is,
the rate of failure of tech startups in general is around 75 percent
according to Fast Company Magazine, and biotech startups face many
challenges unique to the industry. Today, potential investors are often
wary after some biotech companies received extravagant valuations only
to come crashing down. While a few flame out in spectacular public
manner — Theranos perhaps representing the most extreme and unsettling
case — most die quieter deaths as a result of insufficient funding,
errors in management or poor navigation of the enormous practical
hurdles involved. Products and innovations that may carry lethal risks
must undergo extravagant vetting relative to most other products
entering the marketplace, creating a landscape of exceptional complexity
and risk for biotech companies. Team members savvy in the byzantine
world of regulatory law are often required assets for successful teams.
In the biotech universe, timing is everything. Decisions that can make
or break startups include when to interest larger biotech or pharma
conglomerates in licensing some of your technology or buying your
company outright. An unusual blend of optimism, aggressive perseverance
and practicality are among the essential ingredients. When is it
appropriate to tackle roadblocks and when should companies cut their
losses for a promising idea that faces too many setbacks? Success
requires a perfect storm of pathbreaking science, societal need, strong
leadership in a variety of areas and adequacy of funding. On the other
hand, the best ideas hold the potential to radically transform human
health and improve the quality of life for millions of people around the
world. Taking research to the market The seminar kicked off with a
discussion moderated by Professor Bert Jacobs, director of the School of
Life Sciences, titled "Targeting Educational Goals to Fit Industry."
Next, Professor Neal Woodbury, director of the School of Molecular
Sciences, moderated a discussion on bioindustry challenges and
academia’s response. Seed funding for new startups and the ins and outs
of venture capital investment were explored. One challenge common to
most biotech startups is presentation: how to package and offer up
enough of the salient science to entice potential investors without
overwhelming them with minutiae. Protection of sensitive intellectual
property, especially for companies seeking to break into the vast
markets in China, can also be a critical consideration. The afternoon
session featured rapid-fire descriptions of six new biotech startups, as
members of the local business community peppered the presenters with
questions and suggestions for furthering the success of these ventures:
NanoPin NanoPin is a company founded in 2017 by Tony Hu, a researcher in
the Biodesign Virginia G. Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics.
Their proprietary technology, described by NanoPin CEO Thomas Tombler,
uses a nanoparticle-based platform, coupled with high-throughput mass
spectroscopy to detect and quantitate disease biomarkers in patient
blood samples. Specifically, Nanopin addresses the urgent need for more
accurate, cost-effective diagnostic tools for tuberculosis, a deadly
disease estimated to affect some 10 million people worldwide and cause
1.7 million annual deaths. TB can be difficult to diagnose using
conventional methods, particularly in children and “paucibacillary”
cases in which the abundance of mycobacterium — causative agent of the
disease — is very low. Speed is also a critical component. The current
gold standard diagnostic can take six to eight weeks to yield a final
result, as opposed to NanoPin’s rapid diagnostic. The versatile platform
holds the promise for rapid diagnosis of a range of diseases. NanoPin
recently received $2 million in seed funding to develop this diagnostic
and monitoring platform for tuberculosis management. Calviri Improved
cancer treatment and prevention are the focus of Stephen Albert
Johnston’s startup company Calviri. Johnston is the director for the
Center for Innovations in Medicine and a professor in the School of Life
Sciences. The company presentation, delivered by Douglas Thamm, director
of clinical programs, described the use of peptide array technology to
screen for cancer. Existing methods for analyzing tumor diversity in
sequence data can take months. Further, the radical heterogeneity of
many mutations found in cancerous tumors require time-consuming and
exorbitant personalized therapies or vaccine designs. Calviri’s
technology focuses on net-antigens, mutations that may be common to a
broader range of cancer cases than the so-called neo-antigens that have
been studied by the cancer community. By contrast, net-antigens are
reduced through transcription and RNA splicing, producing highly
immunogenic errors. Use of such net-antigens could enable faster,
simpler, and less expensive methods for the production of personal
cancer vaccines and perhaps one day, even a generally used cancer
vaccine. ASU was awarded $6.4M multiyear grant from the Open
Philanthropy Project to test preventive cancer vaccine for dogs. OncoMyx
Therapeutics Grant McFadden, director of the Biodesign Center for
Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, presented details of his
company OncoMyx Therapeutics. The spinout has leveraged McFadden’s
research in virology to develop technologies targeting hematologic and
solid tumors with a unique oncolytic virus called myxoma (MYXV) and a
novel patented systemic delivery approach. Myxoma is a standout in the
viral world, a pathogen found exclusively in rabbits, where its presence
is rapidly lethal. The company, however, is interested in another
property of myxoma: its effectiveness as an oncolytic or anticancer
agent in humans. Myxoma, a member of the pox virus family, is highly
immunostimulatory, and is nonpathogenic in any organism outside of
rabbits. The virus has a unique ability to be carried systemically by
human leukocytes where it can then infect tumor cells. OncoMyx will
spearhead the next-stage development plans of oncolytic myxoma virus to
seek FDA approval and conduct the first human clinical trials, using
their patented systemic delivery approach. The company will capitalize
on McFadden’s two decades of research into the potential of oncolytic
viruses. Professor McFadden sequenced the myxoma virus genome in 1999
and since then has produced dozens of genetically engineered constructs,
demonstrating its ability as an oncolytic agent across many tumors in
preclinical cell and animal models. FlexBioTech, Inc FlexBioTech, Inc is
another cancer-focused biotech startup co-founded by CEO and physician
scientist Karen Anderson, a researcher in the Biodesign Virginia G.
Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics. In addition to her role as a
translational cancer researcher at Biodesign, Anderson holds a joint
appointment as a breast cancer medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic Arizona
and professor in the School of Life Sciences, focused on tumor
immunology, vaccine development and biomarker development. She has
developed clinical immune biomarkers for clinical use (Videssa Breast,
Provista Diagnostics) and in clinical trials (HPV biomarkers, used in
the HOUSTON trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center), and point of care
diagnostics (in development for cervical cancer detection in India).
FlexBioTech focuses on point-of-care biomarker detection. The technology
permits rapid, low-cost home biomarker detection on a mobile platform
that transmits results to hospitals and physicians. Gemneo Bioscience
Joseph Blattman is an immunologist who studies how the immune system
responds to vaccination and viral infection. He is a researcher in the
Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy. Blattman’s
company, Gemneo Bioscience, is the 100th spinout company formed at ASU.
Gemneo’s mission is to provide physicians with more optimal cancer
treatments and groundbreaking immunotherapies to help improve cancer
outcomes. The company is developing innovative molecular-based
single-cell genomics technology that does not require cell sorting,
which will greatly accelerate the speed and decrease the costs of
analyzing the genomic heterogeneity of cancer and immune tissues,
microbiomes, and beyond. Gemneo’s mission is to rapidly put their
technology in the hands of academic and pharma industry researchers, to
advance the frontiers of precision medicine, reduce costs and improve
patient outcomes. The research on DNA origami nanoprobes for single-cell
multi-gene analysis and single-cell analysis of tumor heterogeneity was
funded by NIH grants and is an excellent example of federally-funded
research leading to advances in science and medicine. Gemneo’s platform
technology can be used to profile cancer genomics and identify rare
cells that influence disease progression that current technologies are
not able to detect. Attometrics The burgeoning field of aging research
has given rise to Wayne Frasch’s startup biotech company, Attometrics,
which has developed technologies for evaluating telomere length.

Startups give you opportunities that can be turned into gold, says
Airbnb country manager

The Times of India (TOI)

September 15, 2018 Saturday

Airbnb country manager Amanpreet Bajaj realised early on the potential
of the Internet to build communities. Bajaj worked for American Express
and Ernst & Young before developing his first startup, Letsbuy.com, in
2009. It transformed people's shopping habits. "We were the first
players to venture into e-commerce in India," he told TOI.

"Flipkart that time was selling books, we sold electronics." You
co-founded Yankee Delhi in 2000 while still in college -how did that
idea originate, and what did it teach you? My first stint as an
entrepreneur was back in Delhi University while doing my Bachelors in
IT. This was a time when the Internet was still young. A group of
friends wanted to check out events happening in the city. (But) there
was no central depository, no forum (or) place to discuss your views as
a community. So we decided to create a youth portal. The name 'Yankee'
sounds hilarious but it was actually chosen by the audience via an
online poll. It was certainly a great opportunity to mingle with the
youth and dabble in city-specific issues.What it taught me was the
attitude to create things from scratch. It gave me the confidence that
if you have an idea, you can always build things up - all of that has
come true with Airbnb. Yankee Delhi ran for a couple of years, but after
graduation all friends left for other places and careers. That stint
shaped my career - it was a great experience. What have you learnt from
your failures?As with every startup, there are good days and bad days.
Ask any startup founder - how do they solve a new problem every day? But
more than challenges, startups give you opportunities to be turned into
gold. Letsbuy.com was the fundamental phase of my career, a
rollercoaster ride. But growing any sort of enterprise teaches you
resilience, and the ability to adapt. When you create an enterprise you
are not only responsible for your actions but (also) how they will
impact your employees - when I meet my ex-employees, who are now VPs and
CFOs at big firms, they thank me for teaching them the intricacies of
the trade.How does Airbnb compete with, say, OYO Rooms and
Zostel?Millennials want to travel more, so there is no competition with
OYO and the likes. I believe we can all co-exist under the hospitality
umbrella. Hospitality in India is a vast market, (and) with more
choices, there is an appetite for more services - so, we strive to
provide more personalised and local experiences. You have always, in
your interviews, spoken about your mentor Brian Chesky. Which lessons of
his have you taken on board? Brian co-founded Airbnb in an apartment in
San Francisco. He is a great example of a leader who kept the
community's interests at heart, and empowered it economically. He is a
leader with compassion, who cares about his staff, stakeholders and the
community. In a nutshell, he has impacted many lives and there is a lot
to learn from him. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Businesses should build for a need, not for a want - panel on Innovation
and Impact at Scale

The importance of finding the right product market fit at the right
time, having a global perspective from an early stage, and ensuring that
your customers go on to become advocates for your brand were some of the
key takeaways from a panel discussion on 'Innovation and Impact at
Scale' on Day 2 at TechSparks 2018.

Panellists included KT Prasad, Country Director - India, Zendesk;
Prabhakar Jayakumar, Country Director - India, Digital Ocean; Pankaj
Mitra, Director & India Head, Cisco Investments; Krishnachytanya
Ayyagari (KC), Program Manager, Google Cloud; VeerChand Bothra, Chief
Entrepreneur and Evangelist, Netcore; Kuppulakshmi Krishnamoorthy, Chief
Evangelist, Zoho and Madhurima Agarwal, Senior Manager, NetApp
Excellerator. The panel was moderated by Vishal Krishna, Business
Editor, YourStory.

Vishal kicked off the discussion by asking the panellists what
innovation meant to them and their respective organisations. According
to Pankaj, innovation is what enables companies to do their core work
better, and also do well in new markets and get new customers.

Prasad described innovation using a simple analogy. "Bread has already
been invented, as has the knife. Now slicing that bread would be
considered innovation. Finding a unique proposition to add value in
something already existing is innovation."

Kuppulakshmi said, "For us at Zoho, innovation defines usefulness in the
coolest, smartest form, which arrives at the right time and can be
sustained."

"Are they making things faster better or cheaper? That's how we look at
innovation. Is their solution going to clock in more revenue for
themselves and NetApp," said Madhurima.

Do your own thing, but pay attention to others

Prabhakar reiterated it was important for startups with an idea to focus
on building for a need, rather than for a want. "As entrepreneurs, you
are passionate about your idea, married to the idea even. But listen to
a lot of people - investors, friends and colleagues. If it doesn't
resonate with potential customers it's an alarm bell." He added another
word of caution, which was not to get too caught up with buzzwords in
tech and do something just because that's in vogue.

KC elaborated on how businesses could effectively reach customers and
know whether they are approaching the right person at right time. "Your
click stream on your website can be a good indicator of where your
market lies. Deal with data, understand internal logs, public website
data and then go for customers rather than approach it in an ad hoc
manner," said KC.

Have clarity right from the beginning

Prabhakar said that at the minimum viable product (MVP) stage itself,
businesses should choose a technology architecture which can scale as
the organisation grows, and factor in aspects such as security.
Otherwise, going back and redoing processes can be a huge challenge.

Pankaj advised startups to take a decision right at the beginning on
whether they wanted to tap global markets or only focus on India, which
is a massive emerging market, but not as mature for certain sectors. If
they do decide to go global, they should then tie up with a partner who
can help them fast.

Prabhakar also spoke about the importance of a cultural fit. "Build the
right culture and team as you scale, look for a global market and at
your solution from a global perspective," he said.

Prasad spoke about the importance of inclusive hiring and advised
startups to focus more on ensuring a cultural fit when building a team.
"While technology can be taught, the belief in the idea and product
needs to be same within the team," he said.

On whether startups should pivot if they are not profitable, Pankaj said
while it depended on the stage of the company, the primary role of a
startup was to find repeatable monetisation, and that it was important
for startups to be flexible and agile.

Make your customers your loyal advocates

Prasad's advice on how to scale sustainably was, "While startups should
spend on customer acquisition, most successful startups don't forget to
spend on customers they have already acquired. Take care of them and
they will go on to become your loyalists. Most successful companies also
invest in employee happiness. Finally, you need to ensure that you are
investing in a scalable technology platform."

According to Veer, while customers are the primary stakeholder
businesses, it was important that they also create an impact across all
stakeholders in the ecosystem. "The impact is creating value for
customers, then employees and then shareholders, ultimately creating
value for society as a whole."

Prabhakar added to this. "Our customers advocate for our brand. Creating
advocates who can do the talking for your brand on your behalf -- that's
impact."

According to Prasad, since India is largely process-driven, when
pitching about a product or idea it is easy to get caught up in the
concept of its relevance. Instead, he says, startups should focus on
whether the product or idea is adding value to customers, understand
that and articulate it in their conversations.

He also advised startups to take failures in the right spirit and view
them as learnings. As parents, we are always afraid that our children
will fall. But they need to fall to learn to walk. "It's the same with
technology. Failures go faster than success, and teach you not to repeat
mistakes," he said.

Drive collaboration across the ecosystem

Veer shared that when he started out, there was no structured support
system for startups. "Being a product person, I can understand the
business side of things but needed someone who knew the tech side well.
Having a co-founder, having an advisory board, made a huge difference,"
he said.

Madhurima said that at NetApp Excellerator, they evaluate how a
startup's offering can solve a customer pain point from NetApp's
perspective and based on that, they invite select startups to come on
board as alliance partners, and collaborate with the NetApp sales team
for joint RFPs and client pitches.

Adding to the thread of collaboration, KC said, "There is value in
working together. Collaboration is important for the ecosystem. We all
should ideally collaborate to improve the quality of startups."

Success rate of Indian startups higher than rest of the world: Piyush
Goyal

MINT

December 14, 2022 Wednesday

Length: 455 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Dec. 14 -- Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday informed
the Lok Sabha that the success rate of startups in India is relatively
higher than in the rest of the world.

During the question hour at the lower house of the Parliament, Goyal
stated that there were 84,012 recognised startups in the country at the
end of November.

"Startups are prone to failures is a very high probability. Though I
must say, the success rate of startups in India is relatively higher
than the rest of the world...," the Minister of Commerce & Industry said
on 14 December.

He added that the recognised startups in the country have increased from
452 in 2016 to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022.

The Central government launched the Startup India initiative on January
16, 2016 to boost the startup ecosystem.

The Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS), Startup India Seed Fund Scheme
(SISFS), and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS) extend support
to startups at various stages of their business cycle.

The Startup India Seed Fund Scheme has been approved for four years
starting from 2021-22 and is being implemented with a corpus of Rs.945
crore.

It is aimed at providing financial assistance to startups for proof of
concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry, and
commercialisation.

In separate news, the funding to Indian startups has dropped
significantly in 2022, as per a report by market intelligence platform
Tracxn.

The funding has been dropped by 35% to $24.7 billion in 2022
year-to-date payroll (YTD) in comparison to $37.2 billion in the same
period last year.

According to the report, the late-stage funding for startups also
plunged by 45% from $29.3 billion between January and November 2021 to
$16.1 billion for the same period in 2022.

Tracxn report stated that BYJU'S ($965 million, Series F), VerSe ($805
million, Series J), Swiggy ($700 million, Series J), Tata Passenger
($496 million, Series D), and Polygon ($450 million, Series E) were the
top firms that cleared the top funding round in the past one year.

Contrary to this report, London-based management consultancy GlobalData,
stated that the country's startup ecosystem saw a 7.5% year-on-year rise
in the number of venture capital deals during January-October.

But the total value of these deals declined 29.8% y-o-y during the
period under review, as per a report.

According to the analysis, Indian startups raised $19.3 billion across
1,456 deals in venture capital (VC) between January and October, against
$27.5 billion across 1,355 deals in this period.

Budget 2019: 7 most critical areas where startups want government to
focus on; Budget 2019: India despite being the third largest startup
ecosystem in the world, does not have a single world-class Indian
product spawned out of India.

Budget 2019: India despite being the third largest startup ecosystem in
the world, does not have a single world-class Indian product spawned out
of India.

Budget 2019: While we have a huge base of startups progressing across
sectors and technologies, a quick look at the ecosystem in 2019 points
to arguably multiple detriments holding back the ecosystem including a
virtual lack of early-stage funding and lack of world-class products
from India. Here are a few areas in which the India budget can help
nurture and support early-stage startups based on the feedback we
obtained from more than 50 startups across 7 cities in India:

Virtual lack of funding: Funding for early-stage startups in India is
one of the lowest in the world. What seems like yet another part of the
overall construct of the startup evolution process, angel or early-Stage
funding is probably the most important part of the entire ecosystem.
Mistakes at this stage are liable to have more severe consequences as
one goes up the proverbial value chain.

Taxation: Why should a fledgeling ecosystem like startups be taxed on
multiple fronts? GST and SGST should be either charged at extremely low
rates or be left out completely in the first 7 years after inception. To
add, Income tax for employees at startups needs a relook, given that
most startup founders and employees join these ventures taking a pay
cut. Moreover, the threat of closure looms large as startups by their
very definition function in a challenging environment. It is common
knowledge now that 80% of startups fail in the first 3-5 years.

Angel tax, which came into effect 5 years back has experienced constant
contention within the community. Investments in startups should not
warrant tax, especially if they are related to longer-term gains in the
capital. We need to handhold the supporting ecosystem of investors to
get them to fire the ecosystem. Angel investments are fraught with the
highest level of risks/failures in startups, so can we avoid taxing
them? It's a very small base which has managed to grow successfully,
after all.

Obtaining grants: There's an obvious anomaly in the availability of
funds and the ease of obtaining the same including government grants.
Unfortunately, the large sums on offer as grants haven't been actually
deployed to startups. It's a typical case of over-regulation, lack of
clear information and guidelines on how to obtain the grants and funds
which have led to a very small fraction of the Fund of Funds getting
disbursed.

World class ecosystem: India despite being the third largest startup
ecosystem in the world, does not have a single world-class Indian
product spawned out of India, even if they are setting out to solve
India specific problems. The most successful startups in India including
the ambitious aspirants want to be based out of Singapore, the US or
even new-age startup destinations like Estonia and Canada.

It's time to take a relook at the ecosystem. Despite being the third
largest ecosystem, why do we lack world class products? It's almost akin
to our attitude during Olympics - being the second most populous country
we rest heavy on the one gold, few silvers and bronzes. Unicorns, only
reflect a single dimension of successful funding and valuation.

IP protection: It's a pity that most of the successful startups in India
or the ones which wish to be successful are uprooting from India and
looking towards Singapore, Delaware and even new age destinations like
Canada for registration, largely due to the IP/patent protection region
in India. IP and innovation thrive in an environment of fairness created
by strong patent and business/product/idea protection laws.

Patient capital: While VC money is pouring aplenty in mature stage
startups, this is not necessarily the most optimal source of fund for a
vast majority of next phase of startups. Startups especially focused on
developing products in deeptech space need capital which is "not in a
hurry". It's unlike the funding environment in e-commerce, which is
driven by quick growth in GMV followed by successful additional rounds
of funding. Product-based startups by their own volition have chosen the
long-term game. They should be supported by the government via grants or
funding for working capital which doesn't come with the short term
outcomes focused by venture capitalists.

Public procurement: State and central governments and public sector
units are one of the largest spenders in technology and infra projects.
Unfortunately, the government procurement and product/service
integration process are driven by archaic tendering norms, which
virtually renders all startups ineligible for the application. Shouldn't
the govt look at offering commercial projects to startups and can we
have a certain percentage of the projects reserved for startups,
especially in the technology space? This will give the much-needed
revenue, recognition and the opportunity to scale to startups.

INDIAN STARTUPS CAUGHT OFF GUARD AS CHINESE CAPITAL DRIES UP

MintAsia (India)

July 10, 2020 Friday

Copyright 2020 HT Media All Rights Reserved

Length: 2108 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, July 10 -- Earlier this month, after India abruptly announced
a ban on 59 Chinese apps, TikTok's chief executive officer (CEO) Kevin
Mayer called for a virtual town hall with his India employees.

Over the past two years, ByteDance, which owns TikTok and Helo (also
included in the list of the banned apps), had established a large
presence in India. Despite the border conflict between India and China
that led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers and the anti- China rhetoric
that had been bubbling up here as the pandemic spread, the
Beijingheadquartered ByteDance had no inkling that a ban was coming.

Mayer, who had joined TikTok as its global CEO only in May from the
American entertainment firm The Walt Disney Company, sought to allay the
concerns of the India employees. Mayer, 58, told the ByteDance employees
that he was known to look after his employees as if they were family and
that he would fight for his team. TikTok would continue to pay salaries
and avoid cutting jobs for now, he added.

But Mayer's address, which lasted a few minutes, failed to provide much
comfort to TikTok employees, two company executives said.

"His town hall was really brief and there were no details on what the
company can do to deal with this. No one was convinced ... While we're
still hoping that the ban will be reversed, I wouldn't say anyone
expects it.

Many have already started looking out for other jobs," one of the
executives said.

The government's move, however, was cheered by local entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists who expect startups in social networking, media and
other spaces to benefit from the forced withdrawal of TikTok, Helo,
SHAREit, NewsDog and others. Indian startups have faced existential
threats mostly from American and Chinese companies that use their
technology prowess and limitless capital to overpower local rivals. If
the ban on Chinese companies stays, it'll provide respite to local
startups by permanently removing one set of competitors whom they
believe were engaged in the unfair practice of "capital dumping." The
ban was the second time in months that India had moved to put
restrictions on Chinese companies and investors. In April, direct
investments by Chinese investors into Indian companies without
regulatory approval were prohibited. In that case, the impact on Indian
startups was decidedly negative- Chinese investors have poured over $8
billion into startups directly or indirectly over the past decade, and
in recent years, they had become the most important source of capital
for small and large internet firms alike.

Put together, the two policy measures will lead to an immediate freeze
on Chinese capital in India's startup ecosystem that is likely to last
until a political resolution of the latest border dispute. It will leave
a huge funding gap for internet firms that are already struggling to
cope with the slump caused by the pandemic. This blow easily outweighs
the potential benefits to a handful of social networking startups.

There is a small possibility that if the two governments reach a
compromise, both venture capitalists and the banned companies from China
will return. Hence, the long-term impact of the moves remain unclear.
Byte- Dance is pleading its case with the government and has offered to
set up an engineering office and data centres in India, among other
steps.

It is clear that India's startup ecosystem has become a key
geo-political battleground notwithstanding its small size-imports in
sectors like smartphones and pharmaceuticals from China dwarf startup
activity involving the two countries. But as foreign policy experts have
pointed out, India has few viable options to undertake substantial
retaliatory actions against China. In this context, banning apps and
placing investment restrictions are seen as low-risk manoeuvres that
could help the government save face.

One thing is certain: the startup ecosystem, whose development in the
past decade had come largely in-and many say, because of-a policy
vacuum, is now increasingly being shaped by the whims of the government.

While it has benefitted from moves like demonetization and the Chinese
app ban, the lack of consistency and stability in policymaking could
easily swing the other way and hurt investor outlook over the coming
years.

Social revival For years, entrepreneurs and investors have talked big
about "building for Bharat," but it was the Chinese firms that had led
the way in creating products for the Indian masses. From 2016, the
availability of fast, cheap internet connections together with the
proliferation of low-cost smartphones (most of them Chinese) brought
hundreds of millions of Indians in semi-urban and rural areas online.

Dozens of Chinese firms, which had seen a similar internet boom in their
country, rapidly launched internet browsers, video apps, messaging
services and other products specifically designed for this audience. By
mid- 2017, apps like Bigo Live, UC Browser, SHAREit and UC News had
already become hugely popular among Indians in smaller cities and towns.

Looking at the success of the Chinese firms, investors started hunting
for local startups in social networking, video and news content with a
focus on vernacular language offerings. For a short period, companies
like ShareChat, Clip and Dailyhunt became investor darlings.

However, the expansion of TikTok with its endless stream of addictive
entertainment in 2018 nearly destroyed content startups. In 2018,
ByteDance also launched Helo to crush ShareChat, from which Helo was
copied, and outspent its stunned rival many times over to attract users.
As a result, ShareChat's growth slowed, Clip was forced to sell itself
for a pittance and investors deserted content startups.

After establishing a large user base, Byte- Dance began to sell ads on
TikTok and Helo in 2019. TikTok was expected to become the fastest-
growing digital ads platform this year and emerge as a serious rival to
Facebook and YouTube, an achievement that no company has achieved in
nearly a decade.

The ban has put the brakes on this transformation of India's social
networking and online advertising spaces. One big beneficiary so far has
been ShareChat. Its app base has risen by more than 50 million in the
week after the ban. The company plans to raise a large new round of
capital that will lift it into the unicorn club from its present
valuation of about $600-650 million. ShareChat, incidentally, has at
least four Chinese investors.

Short-video platform Roposo (owned by ad tech firm InMobi) followed by
other TikTok clones like Chingari and Mitron have all registered a spike
in app downloads since the ban.

"If the ban continues, it'll be a defining moment for social networking
startups," said Anand Lunia, partner at venture capital firm India
Quotient, which was one of the earliest backers of ShareChat, Clip,
Roposo and other social networking startups.

Despite the optimism, it is unclear how many social networking startups
will thrive at a large scale. Social networking tends to be a
winner-take-most business, meaning that even if the Chinese apps are
banned for good, only a very small number of local startups could end up
extracting any meaningful value.

And while the banned Chinese apps served hundreds of millions, their
actual business- through advertising revenue and in-app purchases- was
relatively meagre, reflecting the low spending power of their users. One
internet analyst estimated the overall business on these apps (excluding
Club Factory and Shein, which are e-commerce marketplaces) to be easily
less than $1 billion annually.

In addition, investors expect Google and Facebook to corner the largest
chunk of ad revenues given up by the Chinese companies.

"It is very likely that much of the ad spending that would have gone to
TikTok or NewsDog will now be moved to YouTube (owned by Google),
Facebook and Instagram (owned by Facebook)," an executive at a content
startup said. "These apps are considered safe advertising options and
their reach is unrivalled by any local startup." Huge blow The purpose
of India's curbs on Chinese investments in April was to prevent Chinese
firms from buying local companies on the cheap during the pandemic.

But as a blanket measure that covered even minority Chinese investments,
it was criticized as misguided by VCs and entrepreneurs who pointed out
that Chinese firms had anyway never sought to buy Indian internet
companies.

Though Chinese firms and funds have invested in startups across sizes
and sectors, from Series A companies to unicorns and from e-commerce,
mobility, logistics to financial services, healthcare and education,
they are only minority shareholders.

After the restrictions were announced, law firms raced to complete
funding deals in the small window before the rule took effect.

Even afterwards, lawyers urged their Chinese clients to continue
investing albeit in smaller volumes. The advice was: lie low and this
will pass. At least two funding deals involving Chinese investors were
signed in May and early June and sent to Indian regulators for approval
(which hasn't been granted yet).

Some startups trying to raise funds from Chinese funds had even
discussed the possibility of shifting their holding company to Singapore
to get around the new rule.

But the lethal clash between the two countries over the Galwan Valley
dashed any hopes of a speedy return to normalcy for Chinese investors.
Many of them are now actively looking to exit from portfolio companies,
especially those that they believe are underperforming, people familiar
with the matter said. They are willing to sell their shares in secondary
share sales at significant discounts to these companies' present
valuations, the people said. In portfolio companies that are thriving,
Chinese investors are holding on for now.

The unravelling of Chinese holdings in Indian startups will be a long,
painful process that will hurt both parties. In future, Chinese firms
could invoke shareholder rights that make it bothersome for their
portfolio firms to raise fresh capital without the former's
participation.

The more likely consequence of the India-China stand-off on startups,
however, is that they will struggle to find replacements for Tencent's
large cheques, or the deal volumes supplied by Shunwei Capital,
especially in the current environment.

From late 2019, startup funding had started to slow in India and
globally in the wake of the failed WeWork public offering. The pandemic
then devastated many internet firms and forced VCs to freeze new
investments, triggering a funding crisis. The loss of Chinese capital
will exacerbate the funding downturn and could lead to a higher number
of startup failures and distress sales over the next two years.

In the crosshairs Apart from losing access to Chinese capital, three
large Indian internet companies in particular- InMobi, Oyo and
Paytm-could be hurt by the stand-off between the countries.

Unlike most Indian startups, which have avoided venturing into China,
InMobi and Oyo have large operations there and count the country as one
of their top two markets.

InMobi has said that it generates about a fourth of its revenues from
China, while Oyo has invested hundreds of millions of dollars on
expanding in Asia's largest economy.

Any retaliatory action by China will cause significant damage to the two
firms. Oyo seems especially vulnerable, as its business has collapsed
globally; China, whose economy has reopened after it successfully
controlled the pandemic, was one of the few markets where a strong
recovery was possible for Oyo this year.

Paytm, India's most valuable startup, has close ties with China's
Alibaba Group, which in turn is known to be close to China's ruling
party. Alibaba's sister firm Ant Financial is the biggest investor in
One97 Communications, Paytm's parent firm, while Alibaba is the biggest
shareholder in Paytm E-commerce.

The Alibaba Group controls nearly 40% in Paytm and Paytm E-commerce.
Alibaba and Paytm run a joint venture in online gaming Paytm First
Games. Paytm has also said in the past that it uses Aliyun, Alibaba's
cloud computing service. Given that financial services is considered a
sensitive sector by India, Paytm's ties with Alibaba are likely to be
scrutinized by regulators.

Paytm said that none of its "investors or other stakeholders" have
access to its customer data. "All of the data across all our ventures
are stored in India," a Paytm spokesperson said.

Startups wake up to a post-China world

MINT

July 7, 2020 Tuesday

Length: 2100 words

Dateline: Bengaluru

Body

Bengaluru, July 7 -- Last week, after India abruptly announced a ban on
59 Chinese apps, TikTok's CEO Kevin Mayer called for a virtual town hall
with his India employees.

Over the past two years, ByteDance, which owns TikTok and Helo (also
included in the list of the banned apps), had established a large
presence in India. Despite the border conflict between India and China
that led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers and the anti-China rhetoric
that had been bubbling up here as the pandemic spread, the
Beijing-headquartered ByteDance had no inkling that a ban was coming.

Mayer, who had joined TikTok as its global CEO only in May from the
American entertainment firm The Walt Disney Company, sought to allay the
concerns of the India employees. Mayer, 58, told the ByteDance employees
that he was known to look after his employees as if they were family and
that he would fight for his team. TikTok would continue to pay salaries
and avoid cutting jobs for now, he added.

But Mayer's address, which lasted a few minutes, failed to provide much
comfort to TikTok employees, two company executives said.

"His town hall was really brief and there were no details on what the
company can do to deal with this. No one was convinced . While we're
still hoping that the ban will be reversed, I wouldn't say anyone
expects it. Many have already started looking out for other jobs," one
of the executives said.

The government's move, however, was cheered by local entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists who expect startups in social networking, media and
other spaces to benefit from the forced withdrawal of TikTok, Helo,
SHAREit, NewsDog and others. Indian startups have faced existential
threats mostly from American and Chinese companies that use their
technology prowess and limitless capital to overpower local rivals. If
the ban on Chinese companies stays, it'll provide respite to local
startups by permanently removing one set of competitors whom they
believe were engaged in the unfair practice of "capital dumping."

The ban was the second time in months that India had moved to put
restrictions on Chinese companies and investors. In April, direct
investments by Chinese investors into Indian companies without
regulatory approval were prohibited . In that case, the impact on Indian
startups was decidedly negative-Chinese investors have poured over $8

website. Additional information is available on the RTR website at
https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/risk-and-technology-review-national-emissions-standards-hazardous.
This information includes an overview of the RTR program and links to
project websites for the RTR source categories.C. Judicial Review and
Administrative Reconsideration Under Clean Air Act (CAA) section
307(b)(1), judicial review of this final action is available only by
filing a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit (the Court) by October 13, 2020. Under
CAA section 307(b)(2), the requirements established by this final rule
may not be challenged separately in any civil or criminal proceedings
brought by the EPA to enforce the requirements. Section 307(d)(7)(B) of
the CAA further provides that only an objection to a rule or procedure
which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for
public comment (including any public hearing) may be raised during
judicial review. This section also provides a mechanism for the EPA to
reconsider the rule if the person raising an objection can demonstrate
to the Administrator that it was impracticable to raise such objection
within the period for public comment or if the grounds for such
objection arose after the period for public comment (but within the time
specified for judicial review) and if such objection is of central
relevance to the outcome of the rule. Any person seeking to make such a
demonstration should submit a Petition for Reconsideration to the Office
of the Administrator, U.S EPA, Room 3000, WJC South Building, 1200
Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460, with a copy to both the
person(s) listed in the preceding FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
section, and the Associate General Counsel for the Air and Radiation Law
Office, Office of General Counsel (Mail Code 2344A), U.S EPA, 1200
Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460.II. BackgroundA. What is the
statutory authority for this action? Section 112 of the CAA establishes
a two-stage regulatory process to address emissions of HAP from
stationary sources. In the first stage, we must identify categories of
sources emitting one or more of the HAP listed in CAA section 112(b) and
then promulgate technology-based NESHAP for those sources. ``Major
sources'' are those that emit, or have the potential to emit, any single
HAP at a rate of 10 tons per year (tpy) or more, or 25 tpy or more of
any combination of HAP. For major sources,[[Page 49436]]these standards
are commonly referred to as maximum achievable control technology (MACT)
standards and must reflect the maximum degree of emission reductions of
HAP achievable (after considering cost, energy requirements, and non-air
quality health and environmental impacts). In developing MACT standards,
CAA section 112(d)(2) directs the EPA to consider the application of
measures, processes, methods, systems, or techniques, including, but not
limited to, those that reduce the volume of or eliminate HAP emissions
through process changes, substitution of materials, or other
modifications; enclose systems or processes to eliminate emissions;
collect, capture, or treat HAP when released from a process, stack,
storage, or fugitive emissions point; are design, equipment, work
practice, or operational standards; or any combination of the above. For
these MACT standards, the statute specifies certain minimum stringency
requirements, which are referred to as MACT floor requirements, and
which may not be based on cost considerations. See CAA section
112(d)(3). For new sources, the MACT floor cannot be less stringent than
the emission control achieved in practice by the best-controlled similar
source. The MACT standards for existing sources can be less stringent
than floors for new sources, but they cannot be less stringent than the
average emission limitation achieved by the best-performing 12 percent
of existing sources in the category or subcategory (or the
best-performing five sources for categories or subcategories with fewer
than 30 sources). In developing MACT standards, the EPA must also
consider control options that are more stringent than the floor under
CAA section 112(d)(2). We may establish standards more stringent than
the floor, based on the consideration of the cost of achieving the
emissions reductions, any non-air quality health and environmental
impacts, and energy requirements. In the second stage of the regulatory
process, the CAA requires the EPA to undertake two different analyses,
which we refer to as the technology review and the residual risk review.
Under the technology review, we must review the technology-based
standards and revise them ``as necessary (taking into account
developments in practices, processes, and control technologies)'' no
less frequently than every 8 years, pursuant to CAA section 112(d)(6).
Under the residual risk review, we must evaluate the risk to public
health remaining after application of the technology-based standards and
revise the standards, if necessary, to provide an ample margin of safety
to protect public health or to prevent, taking into consideration costs,
energy, safety, and other relevant factors, an adverse environmental
effect. The residual risk review is required within 8 years after
promulgation of the technology-based standards, pursuant to CAA section
112(f). In conducting the residual risk review, if the EPA determines
that the current standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect
public health, it is not necessary to revise the MACT standards pursuant
to CAA section 112(f) and the EPA may readopt the MACT standards as
residual risk standards.\1\ For more information on the statutory
authority for this rule, see 84 FR 47074 (September 6,
2019).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The Court has affirmed this approach of implementing CAA section
112(f)(2)(A): NRDC v. EPA, 529 F.3d 1077, 1083 (D.C Cir. 2008) (``If EPA
determines that the existing technology-based standards provide an
'ample margin of safety,' then the Agency is free to readopt those
standards during the residual risk
rulemaking.'').---------------------------------------------------------------------------B.
What is the PCWP source category and how does the NESHAP regulate HAP
emissions from the source category? The EPA originally promulgated the
PCWP NESHAP on July 30, 2004. The standards are codified at 40 CFR part
63, subpart DDDD. The PCWP industry consists of facilities engaged in
the production of PCWP and/or kiln-dried lumber. Plywood and composite
wood products are manufactured by bonding wood material (fibers,
particles, strands, etc.) or agricultural fiber, generally with resin
under heat and pressure, to form a structural panel or engineered wood
product. PCWP manufacturing facilities also include facilities that
manufacture dry veneer and lumber kilns located at any facility. PCWP
include (but are not limited to) plywood, veneer, particleboard,
oriented strand board (OSB), hardboard, fiberboard, medium density
fiberboard, laminated strand lumber, laminated veneer lumber, wood
I-joists, kiln-dried lumber, and glue-laminated beams. As noted in the
preamble to the proposed amendments, the PCWP source category covered by
this MACT standard includes 230 major source facilities: 93 PCWP
facilities, 121 lumber mills, and 16 facilities that produce both PCWP
and lumber. The affected source under the PCWP NESHAP is the collection
of dryers, refiners, blenders, formers, presses, board coolers, and
other process units associated with the manufacturing of PCWP. The
NESHAP contains several compliance options for process units subject to
the standards: (1) Installation and use of emissions control systems
with an efficiency of at least 90 percent; (2) production-based limits
that restrict HAP emissions per unit of product; and (3) emissions
averaging that allows control of emissions from a group of sources
collectively (at existing affected sources). These compliance options
apply for the following process units: Fiberboard mat dryer heated zones
(at new affected sources); green rotary dryers; hardboard ovens; press
predryers (at new affected sources); pressurized refiners; primary tube
dryers; secondary tube dryers; reconstituted wood product board coolers
(at new affected sources); reconstituted wood product presses; softwood
veneer dryer heated zones; rotary strand dryers; and conveyor strand
dryers (zone one at existing affected sources, and zones one and two at
new affected sources). In addition, the PCWP NESHAP includes work
practice standards for dry rotary dryers, hardwood veneer dryers,
softwood veneer dryers, veneer redryers, and group 1 miscellaneous
coating operations (defined in 40 CFR 63.2292).C. What changes did we
propose for the PCWP source category in our September 6, 2019, proposal?
On September 6, 2019, the EPA published a proposed rulemaking in the
Federal Register for the PCWP NESHAP, 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, that
took into consideration the RTR analyses. In the proposed rulemaking, we
proposed revisions to the SSM provisions for the NESHAP in order to
ensure that they are consistent with the decision of the Court in Sierra
Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019 (D.C Cir. 2008), which vacated two provisions
in EPA's 40 CFR part 63, subpart A--General Provisions, that exempted
sources from the requirement to comply with otherwise applicable CAA
section 112(d) emission standards during periods of SSM: 40 CFR
63.6(f)(1) and (h)(1). We also proposed various other changes, including
addition of electronic reporting requirements, addition of repeat
emissions testing requirements, revisions to parameter monitoring
requirements, and various technical and editorial changes.III. What is
included in this final rule? This action finalizes the EPA's
determinations pursuant to the RTR provisions of CAA section 112 for the
PCWP source category. This action also finalizes other changes to the
NESHAP, including SSM provisions, electronic reporting, additional
emissions testing requirements, and technical and editorial
changes.[[Page 49437]]A. What are the final rule amendments based on the
risk review for the PCWP source category? The EPA proposed no changes to
the PCWP NESHAP based on the risk review conducted pursuant to CAA
section 112(f). We are finalizing our proposed determination that risks
from the PCWP source category are acceptable, considering all of the
health information and factors evaluated, and also considering risk
estimation uncertainty. We are also finalizing our proposed
determination that revisions to the current standards are not necessary
to reduce risk to an acceptable level, to provide an ample margin of
safety to protect public health, or to prevent an adverse environmental
effect. As discussed further in section IV.A of this preamble, the EPA
reviewed public comments and data revisions submitted during the public
comment period but none of the information received affected our
determinations. Therefore, we are not requiring additional controls in
order to reduce risks and, thus, are not making any revisions to the
existing standards under CAA section 112(f)(2). Instead, we are
readopting the existing standards under CAA section 112(f)(2), while
making other modifications under other authorities unrelated to risk.B.
What are the final rule amendments based on the technology review for
the PCWP source category? We determined that there are no developments
in practices, processes, and control technologies that warrant revisions
to the MACT standards for this source category. In the proposal, the EPA
noted a development in resin systems used to produce PCWP at some
facilities but found that facilities generally have not altered their
HAP emission control strategies to date as a result of resin changes and
that it is not necessary, or supported based on available data, at this
time, to amend the current standards. The EPA considered comments
received during the public comment period regarding our technology
review, however, these comments contained no new data or other
information that affected our determinations. Therefore, we are not
finalizing revisions to the MACT standards under CAA section 112(d)(6).
Section IV.B of this preamble provides further details on our conclusion
with respect to the technology review.C. What are the final rule
amendments addressing emissions during periods of SSM? In its 2008
decision in Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019 (D.C Cir. 2008), the Court
vacated portions of two provisions in the EPA's CAA section 112
regulations governing the emissions of HAP during periods of SSM.
Specifically, the Court vacated the SSM exemption contained in 40 CFR
63.6(f)(1) and (h)(1), holding that under section 302(k) of the CAA,
emissions standards or limitations must be continuous in nature and that
the SSM exemption violates the CAA's requirement that some CAA section
112 standards apply continuously. The EPA has eliminated the SSM
exemption in this rule. Consistent with Sierra Club v. EPA, the EPA has
established standards in this rule that apply at all times. The
standards that apply during normal operation have been extended to apply
at all times including SSM in most instances. However, in this final
rule, the EPA has established work practice standards for specific types
of startup and shutdown events as described in section IV.C of this
preamble. The EPA has also revised Table 10 of this rule (the General
Provisions applicability table) in several respects as is explained in
more detail in section IV.C of this preamble. For example, we have
eliminated the incorporation of the General Provisions' requirement that
sources develop SSM plans. We have also eliminated or revised certain
recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are related to the SSM
exemption as described in detail in the proposed rulemaking and
summarized again in section IV.C of this preamble.D. What other changes
have been made to the NESHAP? Other changes to the NESHAP include: 1.
Electronic reporting. As discussed at proposal, the EPA is finalizing
amendments to the reporting requirements in the rule to require
electronic reporting for notifications of compliance status, compliance
test reports, and semiannual reports. Electronic reporting is discussed
further in section IV.D of this preamble. 2. Repeat emissions testing.
As discussed at proposal, the EPA is finalizing amendments to Table 7 to
subpart DDDD of part 63 to require repeat testing every 5 years for
process units controlled with control devices other than biofilters. The
first of the 5-year repeat tests will be required within 3 years of the
effective date of the final amendments. Repeat emissions testing is
discussed further in section IV.E of this preamble. 3. Revisions to
parameter monitoring requirements. As discussed at proposal, the EPA is
finalizing amendments to biofilter bed temperature provisions in 40 CFR
63.2262(m)(1) and the thermocouple calibration requirements in 40 CFR
63.2269 The biofilter bed temperature provisions are discussed further
in section IV.F of this preamble and the thermocouple calibration
requirements are discussed further in section IV.G of this preamble. 4.
Revisions to the non-HAP coating definition. The EPA is finalizing
amendments to the non-HAP coating definition in 40 CFR 63.2292 with
changes from the proposed revision. The non-HAP coating definition is
discussed further in section IV.H of this preamble. 5. Technical and
editorial changes. The EPA is finalizing technical and editorial
changes, as discussed further in section IV.I of this preamble.E. What
are the effective and compliance dates of the standards? The revisions
to the MACT standards being promulgated in this action are effective on
August 13, 2020. The compliance date of the rule amendments for existing
affected sources and other affected sources that commenced construction
or reconstruction on or before September 6, 2019, is August 13, 2021.
Affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after
September 6, 2019, are new sources. New sources must comply with all of
the standards immediately upon the effective date of the standard,
August 13, 2020, or upon startup, whichever is later. All existing
affected sources will have to continue to meet the current requirements
of the NESHAP until the applicable compliance date of the amended rule.
Section IV.D of this preamble discusses electronic reporting and a
semiannual reporting template that facilities must use within 1 year
after it is posted in the EPA's Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting
Interface (CEDRI). In addition, the EPA is finalizing new requirements
to conduct repeat performance testing every 5 years for facilities using
an add-on control system other than a biofilter (see section IV.E of
this preamble). The first of the repeat performance tests must be
conducted within 3 years after August 13, 2020, or within 60 months
following the previous performance test, whichever is later.[[Page
49438]]IV. What is the rationale for our final decisions and amendments
for the PCWP source category? For each issue, this section provides a
description of what was proposed and what is being finalized for the
issue, the EPA's rationale for the final decisions and amendments, and a
summary of key comments and responses. Comment summaries for all
comments and the EPA's specific responses can be found in the RTC
document, available in Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243.A. Residual
Risk Review for the PCWP Source Category1. What did we propose pursuant
to CAA section 112(f) for the PCWP source category? Pursuant to CAA
section 112(f), the EPA conducted a risk review and presented the
results for the review, along with our proposed decisions regarding risk
acceptability and ample margin of safety, in the September 6, 2019,
proposed rulemaking for the PCWP source category (84 FR 47074). The
results of the risk assessment are presented briefly in Table 2 of this
preamble and in the risk report titled Residual Risk Assessment for the
Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category in Support of the
2019 Risk and Technology Review Proposed Rule, and sections III and IV
of the proposal preamble (84 FR 47074, September 6, 2019) available in
the docket for this action. Table 2--Inhalation Risk Assessment Summary

that are currently closed but maintain active operating permits.\3\
Maximum individual excess lifetime cancer risk due to HAP emissions from
the source category.\4\ Maximum target organ-specific hazard index
(TOSHI). The target organ with the highest TOSHI for the PCWP source
category is the respiratory system.\5\ The maximum estimated acute
exposure concentration was divided by available short-term threshold
values to develop an array of hazard quotient (HQ) values. The acute HQ
values shown use the lowest available acute threshold value, which in
most cases is the recommended exposure limit (REL). When an HQ exceeds
1, the EPA also shows the HQ using the next lowest available acute
dose-response value. For the risk assessment conducted at proposal, the
EPA estimated risks based on actual and allowable emissions from the
PCWP source category. The results for the PCWP source category indicated
that both the actual and allowable inhalation cancer risks to the
individual most exposed are below the presumptive limit of acceptability
of 100-in-1 million. The residual risk assessment for the PCWP category
estimated cancer incidence rate at 0.03 cases per year (or one case
every 33 years) based on both source category actual and allowable
emissions. The estimated inhalation cancer risk to the individual most
exposed to actual and allowable emissions from the source category was
30-in-1 million. The assessment showed that approximately 204,000 people
faced an increased cancer risk equal to or above 1-in-1 million from
source category actual emissions from 170 facilities. The number of
people exposed to a cancer risk greater than 10-in-1 million from source
category actual emissions is 650 people. The maximum chronic noncancer
TOSHI due to inhalation exposures was less than 1 (0.8) for actual and
allowable emissions from the source category. The results of the acute
non-cancer refined analysis showed maximum acute HQs of 4 for acrolein
and 2 for formaldehyde emissions based on the acute reference exposure
level. Maximum cancer risk due to ingestion exposures estimated using
health-protective risk screening assumptions are below 6-in-1 million
for the Tier 2 fisher scenario and below 40-in-1 million for the Tier 2
rural gardener exposure scenario.\2\ Considering all the health risk
information and factors and the uncertainties discussed in the preamble
to the proposed amendments (84 FR 47074, September 6, 2019), the EPA
proposed that the risks posed by emissions from the PCWP source category
are acceptable after implementation of the existing MACT
standards.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ As explained in the preamble for the proposed rulemaking, these
multipathway risk estimates would be further reduced with Tier 3
screening.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As directed by CAA section 112(f)(2), the EPA also conducted an analysis
to determine if the current emission standards provide an ample margin
of safety to protect public health. Under the ample margin of safety
analysis, the EPA considers all health factors evaluated in the risk
assessment and evaluates the cost and feasibility of available control
technologies and other measures (including the controls, measures, and
costs reviewed under the technology review) that could be applied to
this source category to further reduce the risks (or potential risks)
due to emissions of HAP identified in our risk assessment. The EPA did
not identify methods for further reducing HAP emissions from the PCWP
source category that would achieve meaningful risk reductions.
Therefore, the EPA proposed that the current PCWP standards provide an
ample margin of safety to protect public health and revision of the
promulgated standards is not required. The EPA also concluded that an
adverse environmental effect as a result of HAP emissions from this
source category is not expected and, therefore, proposed that it is not
necessary to set a more stringent standard to prevent, taking into
consideration costs, energy, safety, and other relevant factors, an
adverse environmental effect. The results of the EPA's residual risk
analysis conducted according to CAA section 112(f)(2) were discussed in
the preamble to the proposed rulemaking (84 FR 47074, September 6,
2019), in the risk report for the proposed rulemaking titled Residual
Risk Assessment for the Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source
Category in Support of the 2019 Risk[[Page 49439]]and Technology Review
Proposed Rule, Docket Item No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0179, and in the
risk report for the final rule titled Residual Risk Assessment for the
Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category in Support of the
2019 Risk and Technology Review Final Rule, in the docket for this
action. The risk report for the final rule is unchanged from the risk
report prepared for the proposed rulemaking.2. How did the risk review
change for the PCWP source category? The EPA has not changed any aspect
of the risk assessment since the September 2019 proposal for the PCWP
source category.3. What key comments did we receive on the risk review,
and what are our responses? The EPA received several comments in support
of and against the proposed residual risk review and our determination
that no revisions were warranted under CAA section 112(f)(2). Generally,
the commenters disagreeing with the risk review misunderstood the type
of data used for the development of the risk review or suggested changes
to the underlying risk assessment methodology. Some commenters noted the
conservative nature of the underlying residual risk methodology.
Commenters also submitted data revisions for 23 of the 233 modeled
facilities. After reviewing the inventory revisions, the EPA concluded
that 21 of the revisions would serve only to reduce modeled risk through
reduced emissions or improved dispersion inputs. Further, the EPA
concluded that neither of the two remaining inventory revisions would
increase the maximum modeled risk for the PCWP source category or change
our conclusions regarding risk acceptability or ample margin of safety.
See the memorandum, Review of Plywood and Composite Wood Products
Emissions Inventory Revisions, in the docket for this action for details
on the inventory revisions submitted. After review of the comments and
information submitted, we determined that no changes to the proposed
residual risk assessment were necessary. The comments and our specific
responses can be found in the RTC document, which is available in the
docket for this action, Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243.4. What is
the rationale for our final approach and final decisions for the risk
review? As noted in our proposal, the EPA sets standards under CAA
section 112(f)(2) using ``a two-step standard-setting approach, with an
analytical first step to determine an `acceptable risk' that considers
all health information, including risk estimation uncertainty, and
includes a presumptive limit on MIR of approximately 1-in-10 thousand''
(see 54 FR 38045, September 14, 1989). The EPA weighs all health risk
factors in our risk acceptability determination, including the cancer
maximum individual risk (MIR), cancer incidence, the maximum cancer
TOSHI, the maximum acute noncancer HQ, the extent of noncancer risks,
the distribution of cancer and noncancer risks in the exposed
population, and the risk estimation uncertainties. Since proposal,
neither the risk assessment nor our determinations regarding risk
acceptability, ample margin of safety, or adverse environmental effects
have changed. For the reasons explained in the proposed rulemaking, the
EPA determined that the risks from the PCWP source category are
acceptable, the current standards provide an ample margin of safety to
protect public health, and more stringent standards are not necessary to
prevent an adverse environmental effect. Therefore, the EPA is not
revising the PCWP NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD) to require
additional controls pursuant to CAA section 112(f)(2) based on the
residual risk review, and the EPA is readopting the existing standards
under CAA section 112(f)(2).B. Technology Review for the PCWP Source
Category The EPA's technology review focused on identifying developments
in practices, processes, and control technologies for process units
subject to standards under the NESHAP that have occurred since 2004 when
emission standards were promulgated for the PCWP source category. The
following process units were included in our review: Green rotary
dryers, hardboard ovens, pressurized refiners, primary tube dryers,
reconstituted wood product presses, softwood veneer dryer heated zones,
rotary strand dryers, secondary tube dryers, conveyor strand dryers,
fiberboard mat dryers, press predryers, and reconstituted wood product
board coolers. The technological basis for the promulgated PCWP NESHAP
was use of incineration-based or biofilter add-on controls to reduce HAP
emissions. Incineration-based controls include regenerative thermal
oxidizers (RTOs), regenerative catalytic oxidizers (RCOs), and
incineration of process exhaust in an onsite combustion unit (referred
to as ``process incineration''). In addition, the PCWP NESHAP contains
production-based compliance options (PBCO) for process units with low
emissions due to pollution prevention measures inherent in their
process, an emissions averaging compliance option, and work practice
requirements for selected process units. In the proposal, the EPA noted
a development in resin systems used to produce PCWP at some facilities
but found that facilities generally have not altered their HAP emission
control strategies to date as a result of resin changes and that it is
not necessary, or supported, based on available data, at this time, to
amend the current standards. The EPA proposed that no revisions to the
PCWP NESHAP are necessary pursuant to CAA section 112(d)(6). The EPA
received comments supporting and opposing our proposed determination
from the technology review that no revisions to the standards are
necessary under CAA section 112(d)(6). Several commenters agreed with
the EPA's decision not to revise the current standards pursuant to CAA
section 112(d)(6). Conversely, another commenter opposed our
determination not to revise the standards and stated that the EPA failed
to satisfy the CAA because it did not set emission standards for
currently unrestricted HAP (such as emissions from the PCWP process
units not currently subject to emissions limits) and regulating these
emissions is ``necessary'' under the CAA. The commenter asserted that
the EPA must review and follow the CAA and existing case law to ensure
it sets a numerical limit for every regulated HAP in order to satisfy
CAA sections 112(d)(2), (3), and (6). The commenter further asserted
that the EPA must update standards when a development is identified,
such as the use of lower HAP resins. In response to the comments, the
EPA maintains that our CAA section 112(d)(6) review of developments in
the processes, practices, and controls applied to sources regulated
under 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, was complete. The technology review
was based on responses to an Information Collection Request (ICR)
conducted under CAA section 114, requiring a mandatory response. In
addition to ICR data provided by respondents, the EPA requested and
reviewed other information from sources to determine if there have been
developments in practices, processes, or control technologies by PCWP
facilities, as described in section 3 of the RTC document. The
technology review was documented in the memorandum, Technology Review
for the Plywood and[[Page 49440]]Composite Wood Products NESHAP, Docket
Item No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0189. Section 3 of the RTC document
contains full responses to the comments received. Regarding the comment
that the technology review did not address the unregulated sources, the
EPA acknowledged in the preamble to the proposed rulemaking that there
are unregulated sources with no-control MACT determinations, and we
stated our plans to address those units in a separate action subsequent
to the RTR at 84 FR 47077-47078. See section 9 of the RTC document for
further discussion of our position regarding our obligations under CAA
section 112(d)(6) with respect to unregulated
sources.\3\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ On April 21, 2020, as the Agency was preparing the final rule for
signature, a decision was issued in LEAN v. EPA, 955 F. 3d. 1088 (D.C
Cir. 2020) in which the Court held that the EPA has an obligation to set
standards for unregulated pollutants as part of technology reviews under
CAA section 112(d)(6). At the time of signature, the mandate in that
case had not been issued and the EPA is continuing to evaluate the
decision.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, the EPA's review of the developments in technology for the
process units subject to the PCWP NESHAP did not reveal any changes that
require revisions to the emission standards under CAA section 112(d)(6).
As discussed in the first paragraph in this section of the preamble, the
PCWP rule was promulgated with multiple options for reducing HAP
emissions to demonstrate compliance with the standard. The EPA found
that facilities are using each type of control system or pollution
prevention measure (such as lower-HAP resins) that was anticipated when
the PCWP emissions standards were promulgated. The EPA did not identify
any developments in practices, processes, or control technologies for
the regulated units beyond those accounted for in the originally
promulgated PCWP NESHAP. Regarding lower-HAP resins, for the proposal,
the EPA characterized changes in the type of resin systems used in the
particleboard, MDF, and hardwood plywood segments of the PCWP industry
due to the formaldehyde standards limiting emissions from these products
\4\ as a ``development'' within the context of CAA section 112(d)(6).
The EPA explained in the proposal that as facilities conduct repeat
testing, they may find that the inlet concentration of formaldehyde and
methanol from their pressing operations has dropped if they are now
using a different, lower-HAP resin system to comply with the California
Air Resources Board (CARB) and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
standards. The decrease in inlet concentration may allow for future use
of the PBCO without an add-on control device, providing an existing
compliance option in addition to the current add-on control device
compliance option. The EPA also explained that while the CARB and TSCA
standards are a ``development'' within the context of CAA section
112(d)(6), these rules do not necessitate revision of the
previously-promulgated PCWP emission standards because the promulgated
PCWP emission standards already include the PBCO provisions for
pollution prevention measures such as lower-HAP resins. The EPA
disagrees that because resin changes made by some mills were noted as a
development in the technology review that this necessitates revisions to
the standards without regard to how the development is already addressed
within the previously-promulgated emission standards, to how it relates
to control technologies used in the industry, or other relevant factors.
For the PCWP source category, the EPA did not identify information
suggesting the resin system changes have significantly altered the type
of process units or HAP pollution control technologies used in the PCWP
industry to date or have led to processes or practices that have not
been accounted for in the promulgated PCWP NESHAP compliance options. As
explained further in Section 3 of the RTC document, at present, limited
HAP emissions data are available to compare PCWP manufacturing process
emissions before and after implementation of resin changes to meet the
product formaldehyde standards. Facilities made a variety of different
resin system changes (if needed for their specific products) in response
to the CARB and TSCA rules, and, therefore, no single broadly-applicable
approach feasible for all mills was identified. The different resin
system changes facilities made, coupled with the limited available HAP
emissions data, ongoing use of add-on control technologies following
resin system changes, and availability of PBCO in the PCWP NESHAP do not
support revising the PCWP NESHAP. Therefore, the EPA concluded it is
not, at this time, necessary or supportable under this CAA section
112(d)(6) review to change the promulgated PCWP NESHAP as a result of
resin changes facilities made to meet the CARB and TSCA rules. If
additional emissions information on resin changes or other changes made
by facilities becomes available and indicates updates need to be made to
standards in future technology reviews, the EPA will evaluate that
information at that time. In summary, the EPA proposed, and is
finalizing the conclusion that no revisions to the PCWP NESHAP are
necessary pursuant to CAA section 112(d)(6). All amendments being made
to the final NESHAP are for reasons other than to reflect developments
under CAA section
112(d)(6).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ In 2008, the CARB finalized an Airborne Toxic Control Measure (ATCM)
to reduce formaldehyde emissions from hardwood plywood, MDF, and
particleboard. Consistent with the CARB ATCM, in July 2010, Congress
passed the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act, as
title VI of TSCA, [15 U.S.C 2697], requiring the EPA to promulgate a
national rule. The EPA finalized the TSCA rule, Formaldehyde Emission
Standards for Composite Wood Products, on December 12, 2016 (81 FR
89674), and finalized an implementation rule on February 7, 2018 (83 FR
5340). Compliance with the TSCA rule was required by December 2018. The
CARB ATCM and the rule to implement TSCA title VI emphasize the use of
low emission resins, including ultra-low-emitting formaldehyde and no
added formaldehyde resin
systems.---------------------------------------------------------------------------C.
SSM Provisions Consistent with the 2008 decision in Sierra Club v. EPA,
the EPA proposed eliminating the SSM exemption in this rule and instead
proposed that the same standards that apply during normal operation also
apply during SSM, except during specific periods of startup and shutdown
as described in section IV.C.2 of this preamble. Additionally, the EPA
proposed several revisions to Table 10 (the General Provisions
applicability table), proposed eliminating the incorporation of the
General Provisions' requirement that the source develop an SSM plan, and
proposed eliminating and revising certain recordkeeping and reporting
requirements related to the SSM exemption, all of which are further
described in section IV.C.4 of this preamble.1. Elimination of the SSM
Exemption As noted in section III.C of this preamble, in its 2008
decision in Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019 (D.C Cir. 2008), the Court
vacated portions of two provisions in the EPA's CAA section 112
regulations governing the emissions of HAP during periods of SSM.
Specifically, the Court vacated the SSM exemption contained in 40 CFR
63.6(f)(1) and (h)(1), holding that under section 302(k) of the CAA,
emissions standards or limitations must be continuous in nature and that
the SSM exemption violates the CAA's requirement that some CAA section
112 standards apply continuously. Consistent with the Sierra Club
decision, the EPA proposed eliminating the SSM exemption in this rule
from 40 CFR 63.2250 and to remove the incorporation of 40 CFR
63.6(f)(1). (40[[Page 49441]]CFR 63.6(h)(1) was not applicable to this
NESHAP.) The EPA received comments supporting and opposing our proposal
to eliminate the SSM exemption in the rule. Commenters opposed to
eliminating the exemption stated that neither the CAA nor judicial
precedent requires the EPA to delete the SSM provisions. According to
these commenters, the best-performing facilities that are the basis for
the MACT floor experience SSM events, and so it is appropriate for the
EPA to recognize and account for those events, as it has in the existing
PCWP MACT standards. One commenter noted that when the EPA promulgated
the 2004 PCWP NESHAP, the EPA determined it was appropriate not to
subject mills to the numerical emission limitations in those standards
during SSM events, requiring instead that sources follow work practices
to minimize emissions during such events, including developing and
following an SSM plan. The commenter asserted that the EPA's proposal to
eliminate 40 CFR 63.2250(a), and thereby require sources to meet the
same emission limitations during periods of SSM, except for very limited
cases (safety related shutdowns and brief periods during startup and
shutdown of pressurized refiners), represents an unauthorized change to
existing MACT standards, specifically claiming that it is not the
product of the technology review described in the CAA, it is not
required by case law, and it is inconsistent with decades of the EPA
practice and judicial interpretations of NESHAP and new source
performance standards. Conversely, a commenter in favor of the EPA's
proposal to eliminate the SSM exemption argued that it is legally
required and necessary in this rulemaking under CAA section 112(d),
including CAA section 112(d)(6), for the EPA to remove the SSM
exemptions for PCWP facilities as it has proposed to do because the CAA
requires standards to apply continuously and the Court precedent (Sierra
Club v. EPA) is a development since the prior standards were made. The
EPA acknowledges comments in support of the removal of the 40 CFR part
63, subpart DDDD, SSM exemption and we are promulgating our proposed SSM
action. We disagree with comments suggesting that the legal precedent
established in case law (Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019 (D.C Cir.
2008) should not apply to subpart DDDD. The Court decision held that
emission limits under CAA section 112 must apply continuously and meet
minimum stringency requirements, even during periods of SSM. Consistent
with the Court's decision and for the reasons explained in the proposal
preamble at 84 FR 47092-47096, we are finalizing our proposal to
eliminate the SSM language in subpart DDDD. As explained in the
proposal, our SSM-related rule revisions are in response to the Court's
vacatur of the SSM exemptions in 40 CFR 63.6(f)(1) and (h)(1). When
incorporated into CAA section 112(d) regulations for specific source
categories, these two provisions exempted sources from the requirement
to comply with otherwise applicable MACT standards during periods of
SSM. The Court's vacatur rendered those provisions null and void prior
to this rulemaking. Eliminating reference to these provisions and other
related General Provisions referenced in subpart DDDD reflects the
vacatur by the Court. We also eliminated the rule specific SSM
provisions in subpart DDDD, as discussed further in section IV.C.4 of
this preamble. The specific changes in the language can be found in
Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243 in the document titled Redline
Version of 40 CFR Part 63, subpart DDDD Showing Final Changes. However,
we do not agree with the commenter who characterized the 2008 Court
ruling as a ``development'' that compels elimination of the SSM
exemption under CAA section 112(d)(6). The EPA is not and need not rely
on CAA section 112(d)(6) in order to eliminate the exemption but is
choosing to take action at this time to make the NESHAP consistent with
the 2009 ruling. As discussed in section IV.C.2 below, we proposed and
are promulgating work practice standards for specific startup and
shutdown events. Therefore, all current subpart DDDD facilities affected
by SSM must be in compliance with a standard at all times (i.e , with
either the normal operational standards or the work practices that apply
during selected startup and shutdown periods) consistent with the Sierra
Club v. EPA decision. Section IV.C.3 of this preamble provides further
information on our position with respect to periods of malfunction.2.
Periods of Startup and Shutdown In finalizing the standards in this
rule, the EPA considered and proposed alternative actions to the simple
removal of SSM provisions in the rule. As an alternative approach
consistent with Sierra Club v. EPA, the EPA may designate different
standards to apply during startup and shutdown. The EPA collected
information with the PCWP ICR to use in determining whether applying the
standards applicable under normal operations would be problematic for
PCWP facilities during startup and shutdown. Facilities operating
control systems generally operate the control systems while the process
unit(s) controlled are started up and shut down. For example, RTOs and
RCOs are warmed to their operating temperature set points using
auxiliary fuel before the process unit(s) controlled startup, and the
oxidizers continue to maintain their temperature until the process
unit(s) controlled shutdown. Biofilters operate within a biofilter bed
temperature range that will be more easily achieved during startup and
shutdown with changes in biofilter bed temperature operating range
discussed in section IV.F of this preamble. Based on the information
collected, the EPA determined that PCWP facilities can meet standards
applicable under normal operations at all times except during periods of
safety-related shutdowns and pressurized refiner startups and shutdowns.
To ensure that a CAA section 112 standard is met during all times, the
EPA proposed alternate work practice standards for safety-related
shutdowns and pressurized refiner startups and shutdowns. After
considering comments on the proposed amendments, the EPA determined that
an alternate work practice standard was also needed for direct-fired
softwood veneer dryers undergoing startup or shutdown of gas-fired
burners. The following sections discuss the work practices the EPA is
finalizing. Each work practice is designed to minimize emissions, in
keeping with CAA requirements. All three work practices minimize the
duration of time and circumstances under which they can be applied.
Further, because all three work practices require the temporary
suspension of material flow through the PCWP process, PCWP facilities
are incentivized to minimize the use and duration of these work
practices. Sections IV.C.2.a and b of this preamble discuss in more
detail the work practice standards for safety-related shutdowns and
pressurized refiner startup and shutdown, respectively, including
comments received about the standards following proposal and the EPA's
final decision regarding their requirements. Section IV.C.2.c of this
preamble discusses the details of the work practice standard for
direct-fired softwood veneer dryers undergoing startup or shutdown of
gas-fired burners.a. Safety-Related Shutdowns As discussed in the
preamble to the proposed rulemaking (84 FR 47093,[[Page 49442]]September
6, 2019) and further elaborated in the RTC document, safety-related
shutdowns differ from routine, planned shutdowns where facilities can
continue routing process unit emissions to the control device until the
process unit is shut down. Safety-related shutdowns have been accounted
for in the process design and are not necessarily frequent but are
pre-determined remedial actions anticipated to occasionally occur to
such a degree that they are also distinguished from malfunctions which
are, by definition, infrequent and not reasonably preventable (40 CFR
63.2). Malfunctions are unpredictable and may require different types of
remediation. For example, the PCWP process predictably shuts down when
these events are triggered. Safety-related shutdowns must occur rapidly
in the event of unsafe conditions such as a suspected fire in a process
unit heating flammable wood material. When unsafe conditions are
detected, facilities must act quickly to shut off fuel flow (or indirect
process heat) to the system, cease addition of raw materials (e.g , wood
furnish, resin) to the process units, purge wood material and gases from
the process unit, and isolate equipment to prevent loss of property or
life and protect workers from injury. Because it is unsafe to continue
to route process gases to the control system, the control system will be
bypassed as the process quickly shuts down, in many cases automatically,
through a system of interlocks designed to prevent dangerous conditions
from occurring. In order to clarify what constitutes a safety-related
shutdown, the EPA proposed a new definition in 40 CFR 63.2292 defining a
safety-related shutdown as an unscheduled shutdown of a process unit
subject to a compliance option in Table 1B to 40 CFR part 63, subpart
DDDD, (or a process unit with HAP control under an emissions averaging
plan developed according to 40 CFR 63.2240(c)) during which time
emissions from the process unit cannot be safely routed to the control
system in place to meet the compliance options or operating requirements
in subpart DDDD without imminent danger to the process, control system,
or system operator. The EPA also proposed a work practice standard for
safety-related shutdowns requiring facilities to follow documented
site-specific procedures such as use of automated controls or other
measures developed to protect workers and equipment to ensure that the
flow of raw materials (such as furnish or resin) and fuel or process
heat (as applicable) ceases and that material is removed from the
process unit(s) as expeditiously as possible given the system design.
These actions are taken by all (including the best-performing)
facilities when safety-related shutdowns occur. Comments were received
both supporting and opposing the proposed work practice for
safety-related shutdowns. Commenters in support of the standards stated
that CAA section 112(h) allows the EPA to promulgate a design,
equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination
thereof, in two circumstances: (1) When HAP ``cannot be emitted through
a conveyance designed and constructed to emit or capture such a
pollutant, or that any requirement for, or use of, such a conveyance
would be inconsistent with any Federal, State, or local law,'' and (2)
when ``the application of measurement methodology . . . is not
practicable due to technological and economic limitations.'' Commenters
stated that safety-related shutdowns of process units with add-on
control equipment present both of those circumstances and provided
operational details summarized in Section 4.3 of the RTC document. The
commenter explained that the best practice for controlling HAP emissions
during such safety-related shutdowns is to minimize the duration of the
event by promptly ceasing the addition of raw materials and heat to the
process and removing materials from process equipment as soon as
possible (although in some instances it is safer to have the material
remain in the process equipment to contain a problem such as a fire). A
separate commenter opposed the EPA's proposed safety-related shutdown
work practice standards, arguing that the EPA has not explained how the
criteria under CAA section 112(h) are met to provide the EPA the
statutory authority to set work practices. The commenter stated that the
work practice standards the EPA proposed are too lax because they are
written by the facilities with no requirement for approval by the EPA.
The commenter contended that the work practices will not achieve
``maximum'' emission reduction because they only instruct facilities to
protect workers and process equipment, with no reference to reducing air
emissions. The commenter urged the EPA to clarify how recordkeeping
requirements would apply in the context of work practice standards. The
full comments and our responses pertaining to safety-related shutdowns
are included in the RTC document. According to CAA section 112(h)(1),
MACT standards may take the form of design, equipment, work practice, or
operational standards ``if it is not feasible in the judgement of the
Administrator to prescribe or enforce an emission standard.'' The phrase
``if it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard''
is defined in CAA section 112(h)(2)(A) and (B) to mean any situation in
which the Administrator determines that: (A) A HAP or pollutants cannot
be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to emit or
capture such pollutant, or that any requirement for, or use of, such a
conveyance would be inconsistent with any federal, state or local law,
or (B) the application of measurement methodology to a particular class
of sources is not practicable due to technological and economic
limitations. The EPA has determined that work practices are appropriate
during safety-related shutdowns in the PCWP industry because facilities
cannot capture and convey HAP emissions to a control device during these
periods for safety reasons. The control device could serve as an
ignition source if there is an upset in the oxygen concentration or
buildup of other combustibles in the PCWP process or exhaust gas
collection system (e.g , combustible gas, condensed pitch on ductwork if
moisture-laden gases in the system are allowed to cool, or wood dust)
due to various conditions (e.g , if PCWP process equipment or pneumatic
conveying systems become plugged). If there are sparks or fire in the
PCWP process unit, conveyance, or the control device, the equipment
could be damaged if exhaust continues to be routed from the PCWP process
unit to the control device. A PCWP dryer or control device may
experience an over-temperature condition indicative of a fire and
triggering rapid equipment isolation. Thus, conveying emissions from the
PCWP process unit to the control device is not technically feasible
during safety-related shutdowns. Further, application of measurement
methodology is not practicable due to technological and economic
limitations. Safety-related shutdowns are brief events that are
incorporated into the process design for safety reasons but are not
desirable operating conditions that constitute normal operations. Even
if staged especially for an emissions measurement (which is economically
impracticable due to lost production), the duration of safety-related
shutdowns is necessarily brief (i.e , minutes), less than the 1 hour it
takes to collect a single emissions measurement sample if the equipment
is set up and measurement contractors are onsite ready to sample, let
alone the 3 hours needed for a full emissions test. Because[[Page
49443]]a full emissions measurement sample cannot be obtained during a
safety-related shutdown, application of measurement methodology is not
practicable due to technological limitations in addition to being
economically impracticable. Therefore, it is the EPA's determination
that PCWP-industry safety-related shutdowns meet the criteria in CAA
section 112(h)(2)(B). Based on our authority to set work practices, the
EPA is finalizing a definition of ``safety-related shutdown'' in 40 CFR
63.2292 and finalizing a work practice for these shutdown events. The
work practice is designed to be consistent with actions commonly
undertaken by facilities to protect plant personnel, production
equipment, and control equipment from dangerous circumstances like fires
and explosions. The final work practice requires facilities to follow
documented site-specific procedures such as use of automated controls or
other measures developed to protect workers and equipment to ensure that
the flow of raw materials (such as furnish or resin) and fuel or process
heat (as applicable) ceases and that material is removed from the
process unit(s) as expeditiously as possible given the system design to
reduce air emissions. The phrase ``to reduce air emissions'' was added
to the standard to address the concern expressed by one commenter that
the work practice should direct facilities to consider air quality. The
actions required by the safety-related shutdown work practice represent
the maximum degree of emissions reduction achievable because they limit
the amount of time, as well as the flow of raw materials and fuel into
the process, and, therefore, emissions from the process undergoing
safety-related shutdown. Rule language relating to the safety-related
shutdown work practice was strengthened for the final rule in response
to the commenter's concern that the EPA is giving full discretion to the
facilities to develop their safety-related shutdown work practices for
their own equipment configurations without oversight by the EPA. To
strengthen the standard, the EPA added an initial compliance requirement
to Table 6 of the final rule to clarify that facilities must have a
record of safety-related shutdown procedures available for inspection by
the delegated authority upon request. In addition, a recordkeeping
requirement was added to Table 8 of the final rule to ensure
documentation is available to track when the work practice is used,
consistent with the proposed requirement under 40 CFR 63.2282(a)(2)(i).
Finally, a reporting requirement was added to 40 CFR 63.2281(c)(4) to
require facilities to report the number of instances and total amount of
time during the reporting period when the safety-related shutdown work
practice is used. If the safety-related shutdown work practice is used
for more than 100 hours during a reporting period, the facility must
report the date, time, and duration of each instance when the work
practice was used. The EPA has concluded that these initial compliance
and ongoing recordkeeping and reporting measures are sufficient to
provide delegated authorities with information needed for oversight. In
addition, to clarify requirements, 40 CFR 63.2250(f)(6) was added to the
final rule to state that the otherwise applicable compliance options,
operating requirements, and work practice requirements (in rows 1
through 5 of Table 3 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD) do not apply when
the startup/shutdown work practices apply (i.e , the work practices in
rows 6 through 8 of Table 3 to subpart DDDD for safety-related shutdown,
pressurized refiner startup and shutdown, and softwood veneer dryer
gas-burner relights). Thus, compliance with the startup/shutdown work
practices (in Table 3 to subpart DDDD, rows 6 through 8) does not
constitute a failure to meet the otherwise applicable compliance
options, operating requirements, and work practice requirements because
these requirements do not apply while the startup/shutdown work
practices apply. Finally, 40 CFR 63.2271(b)(4) was added to clarify that
instances when the startup/shutdown work practice requirements are used
(as reported under 40 CFR 63.2281(c)(4)) are not considered to be
deviations from (or violations of) the otherwise applicable compliance
options, operating requirements, and work practice requirements (in rows
1 through 5 of Table 3 to subpart DDDD) as long as facilities do not
exceed the minimum amount of time necessary for these events.b.
Pressurized Refiner Startups and Shutdowns Pressurized refiners use
steam to heat and soften wood under pressure to grind it apart between
rotating discs into fibers. Pressurized refiners discharge wood fiber
and exhaust gases from refining directly into a primary tube dryer.
Pressurized refiners cannot be vented through the dryer to the control
system (i.e , the dryer control system) for a brief time after they are
initially fed wood material during startup and as wood material clears
the refiner during shutdown because they are not producing useable fiber
suitable for drying or producing PCWP products (hardboard or MDF).
During this time, instead of the pressurized refiner output being
discharged into the dryer, exhaust is vented to the atmosphere (e.g ,
through an abort cyclone) and the wood is directed to a reclaim bin for
storage and, commonly, recycling back into the refining process once it
is running steadily. No resin is mixed with the off-specification
material and the time periods are short (e.g , 15 minutes or less)
before the pressurized refiner begins to discharge wood fiber and
exhaust through the dryer and when the refiner is shutting down. The EPA
proposed a work practice requirement in Table 3 of the rule (40 CFR part
63, subpart DDDD) to apply during pressurized refiner startup and
shutdown that limits the amount of time (and, thus, emissions) when wood
is being processed through the system while exhaust is not routed
through the dryer to its control system. This practice is consistent
with how the best-performing facilities complete startup and shutdown of
pressurized refiners. The proposed work practice stated that facilities
must route exhaust gases from the pressurized refiner to its control
system no later than 15 minutes after furnish is fed from the
pressurized refiner to the tube dryer when starting up, and no more than
15 minutes after furnish ceases to be fed to the pressurized refiner
when shutting down. Comments were received both supporting and opposing
the pressurized refiner startup and shutdown work practice standard.
Commenters supporting the work practice stated that periods of startup
and shutdown of pressurized refiners meet the CAA section 112(h)
criteria for establishing a work practice standard, while commenters
opposing the work practice argued that the EPA does not have statutory
authority to apply work practice standards instead of numerical
emissions limits to pressurized refiner startup and shutdown periods.
Commenters in support of the EPA's proposed work practice standard for
startup and shutdown of pressurized refiners noted that the language of
the standard in Table 3 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD appears to have
a typographical error. The commenters suggested rewording the standard
in Table 3 so that it instructs facilities to route exhaust gases from
the pressurized refiner to the dryer control system no[[Page
49444]]later than 15 minutes after wood is fed to the pressurized
refiner when starting up and to stop wood flow to the pressurized
refiner no more than 15 minutes after wood fiber stops being fed to the
dryer from the pressurized refiner. The commenter opposing the work
practice standard also questioned the timing and recordkeeping
requirements. The full comments and our responses pertaining to
pressurized refiners are included in the RTC document. In response to
these comments, the EPA concluded pressurized refiner startup and
shutdown events meet the criteria in CAA section 112(h)(2)(B).
Pressurized refiners are a particular class of sources where emissions
are associated with wood processed through the refiner. Pressurized
refiners cannot discharge unusable fiber through the tube dryer and its
control system during startup and shutdown. Because venting through the
pressurized refiner abort cyclone during startup and shutdown of
pressurized refiners typically lasts 15 minutes or less, there are
technological limitations to measuring emissions because HAP measurement
methods require a 1-hour sampling time per test run, and a total of
three test runs. The only way to obtain the required sample would be to
operate in abort mode for each 1-hour sampling time. However, abort
``bins'' used to collect the off-spec wood furnish dumped from the
system are not designed like material collection bins or silos for
useable furnish at wood products facilities. Instead, the abort ``bins''
are often areas where off-spec fiber is dumped on the ground between
concrete wind-breaks where it is removed with a front-end loader. Such
areas do not have the capacity for dumping large amounts of fiber as
would be needed to stage an event for 1 to 3 hours of testing,
presenting another technological limitation. Staging abort dumping of 1
to 3 hours of fiber production also presents obvious economic
limitations due to lost production for that time and loss or degradation
of valuable fiber raw material. Finally, measuring emissions during
pressurized refiner startup and shutdown is impractical because the PCWP
NESHAP requires emissions measurement under representative operating
conditions that are the conditions under which the process unit
typically operates, excluding periods of startup and shutdown.
Therefore, the EPA is finalizing a work practice for pressurized refiner
startup and shutdown periods. The EPA agrees that the wording of the
proposed work practice standard for pressurized refiners in Table 3
needed clarification and has rewritten the standard for the final rule
to instruct facilities to route exhaust gases from the pressurized
refiner to its dryer control system no later than 15 minutes after wood
is fed to the pressurized refiner during startup, and to stop wood flow
into the pressurized refiner no more than 15 minutes after wood fiber
and exhaust gases from the pressurized refiner stop being routed to the
dryer during shutdown. In addition, we strengthened the work practice
for startup/shutdown of pressurized refiners in the final rule by
clarifying when the startup/shutdown work practice applies in 40 CFR
63.2250(f)(6), adding an initial compliance requirement to Table 6 of 40
CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, and adding a recordkeeping requirement to
Table 8 of subpart DDDD to track when the work practice is used,
consistent with the proposed requirement under 40 CFR 63.2282(a)(2)(i).
Continuous compliance and reporting provisions were also added in 40 CFR
63.2271(b)(4) and 63.2281(c)(4), respectively, to provide clarity and
aid in enforceability of the work practice requirement.c. Veneer Dryer
Burner Relights An issue with veneer dryer burner relights stemming from
removal of the SSM exemption was raised during the comment period for
the proposed amendments. The EPA received a comment seeking
clarification for direct-fired softwood veneer dryers undergoing
relights of gas-fired burners. Specifically, the commenter noted that 40
CFR 63.2250(d) of the current PCWP rule defines shutoff of direct-fired
burners resulting from partial or full production stoppages as shutdowns
and the lighting or re-lighting of any one or all gas burners in
direct-fired softwood veneer dryers as startups and not a malfunction.
The commenter noted that the EPA proposed no changes to 40 CFR
63.2250(d) which was originally included in the PCWP rule to clarify
that veneer dryer burner relights are not malfunctions due to their
frequency. In the 2004 promulgated standard, these startup/shutdown
events were required to be addressed under the SSM plan. The commenter
explained that following the flame out of the burner, the dryer could
contain non-combusted natural gas that must be purged prior to safely
re-lighting the gas burners. Non-combusted natural gas cannot be
exhausted to the control device due to safety concerns and must be
vented along with whatever process emissions are in the dryer. The
length of the purge varies based on system design, but only lasts a
matter of minutes. Emissions are routed to the control system as
expeditiously as possible following the burner re-light. Therefore, the
commenter stated a dryer gas burner re-lighting startup work practice is
needed for the same reasons as a safety shutdown work practice. However,
because 40 CFR 63.2250(d) deals with dryer re-lights by defining them as
startups, and the proposed rulemaking no longer contains a general
exemption for startups, the commenter stated that some provision is
needed for veneer dryer gas burner lighting and re-lighting. In response
to this comment, the EPA added a work practice to Table 3 of the final
rule to clarify the requirements surrounding softwood veneer dryer
gas-fired burner relights to ensure a standard applies continuously once
the SSM plan is no longer required. The work practice requires
direct-fired softwood veneer dryers undergoing startup or shutdown of
gas-fired burners to cease feeding green veneer into the softwood veneer
dryer and minimize the amount of time direct gas-fired softwood veneer
dryers are vented to the atmosphere due to the conditions described in
40 CFR 63.2250(d). Related text was added to 40 CFR 63.2250(f) noting
the work practice in Table 3 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, applies
when the otherwise applicable compliance options and operating
requirements in the rule cannot be met. An initial compliance
requirement was added to Table 6 of subpart DDDD to have a record of the
procedures for startup and shutdown of softwood veneer dryer gas-fired
burners available for inspection upon request by the delegated
authority. In addition, a recordkeeping requirement was added to Table 8
of subpart DDDD to track when the work practice is used, consistent with
the proposed requirement under 40 CFR 63.2282(a)(2)(i). Continuous
compliance and reporting provisions were also added in 40 CFR
63.2271(b)(4) and 63.2281(c)(4), respectively, to provide clarity and
aid in enforceability of the work practice requirement. Conforming
changes to refer to the veneer dryer burner relight work practice with
the other startup/shutdown work practices were also made throughout the
rule. Further clarification with respect to 40 CFR 63.2250(d) is needed
as a result of our proposal to remove the SSM exemption (including the
SSM plan). The EPA determined that a work practice is appropriate during
direct-fired softwood veneer dryer startups/shutdowns of gas-fired
burners because the conditions of CAA section 112(h)(2)(A) and (B) are
both present during veneer dryer burner relights.[[Page
49445]]Facilities cannot capture and convey HAP emissions to a control
device during these periods for safety reasons. The control device for
the veneer dryer could serve as an ignition source if there is an upset
in the oxygen concentration or increase in the natural gas concentration
in the system. Thus, is it not technically feasible for HAP emissions to
be conveyed to the control device during startups/shutdowns associated
with softwood veneer dryer gas-burner relights. Further, application of
measurement methodology is not practicable due to technological and
economic limitations. Softwood veneer dryer burner relights are brief
events that take less than the 1 hour it takes to collect a single
emissions measurement sample if the equipment is set up and measurement
contractors are onsite ready to sample, let alone the 3 hours needed for
a full emissions test. Because a full emissions measurement sample
cannot be obtained while softwood veneer dryers are undergoing
gas-burner relights, application of measurement methodology is not
practicable due to technological limitations. In addition, attempting to
stage softwood veneer dryer burner relights for purposes of emissions
measurement is economically impracticable because veneer is not being
dried or moving through the veneer dryer when the burners are not lit,
resulting in a production loss during testing. Therefore, the EPA
concludes that direct-fired softwood veneer dryers undergoing
startup/shutdown of gas-fired burners meet the criteria in CAA section
112(h)(2)(B).3. Periods of Malfunction Periods of startup, normal
operations, and shutdown are all predictable and routine aspects of a
source's operations. Malfunctions, in contrast, are neither predictable
nor routine. Instead they are, by definition, sudden, infrequent, and
not reasonably preventable failures of emissions control, process, or
monitoring equipment (40 CFR 63.2) (Definition of malfunction). The EPA
interprets CAA section 112 as not requiring emissions that occur during
periods of malfunction to be factored into development of CAA section
112 standards and this reading has been upheld as reasonable by the
Court in U.S Sugar Corp. v. EPA, 830 F.3d 579, 606-610 (2016). Under CAA
section 112, emissions standards for new sources must be no less
stringent than the level ``achieved'' by the best controlled similar
source and for existing sources generally must be no less stringent than
the average emission limitation ``achieved'' by the best performing 12
percent of sources in the category. There is nothing in CAA section 112
that directs the Agency to consider malfunctions in determining the
level ``achieved'' by the best performing sources when setting emission
standards. As the Court has recognized, the phrase ``average emissions
limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of'' sources
``says nothing about how the performance of the best units is to be
calculated.'' Nat'l Ass'n of Clean Water Agencies v. EPA, 734 F.3d 1115,
1141 (D.C Cir. 2013). While the EPA accounts for variability in setting
emissions standards, nothing in CAA section 112 requires the Agency to
consider malfunctions as part of that analysis. The EPA is not required
to treat a malfunction in the same manner as the type of variation in
performance that occurs during routine operations of a source. A
malfunction is a failure of the source to perform in a ``normal or usual
manner'' and no statutory language compels the EPA to consider such
events in setting CAA section 112 standards. As the Court recognized in
U.S Sugar Corp, accounting for malfunctions in setting standards would
be difficult, if not impossible, given the myriad different types of
malfunctions that can occur across all sources in the category and given
the difficulties associated with predicting or accounting for the
frequency, degree, and duration of various malfunctions that might
occur. Id. at 608 (``the EPA would have to conceive of a standard that
could apply equally to the wide range of possible boiler malfunctions,
ranging from an explosion to minor mechanical defects. Any possible
standard is likely to be hopelessly generic to govern such a wide array
of circumstances''). As such, the performance of units that are
malfunctioning is not ``reasonably'' foreseeable. See e.g , Sierra Club
v. EPA, 167 F.3d 658, 662 (D.C Cir. 1999) (``The EPA typically has wide
latitude in determining the extent of data-gathering necessary to solve
a problem. We generally defer to an agency's decision to proceed on the
basis of imperfect scientific information, rather than to `invest the
resources to conduct the perfect study.'''). See also, Weyerhaeuser v.
Costle, 590 F.2d 1011, 1058 (D.C Cir. 1978) (``In the nature of things,
no general limit, individual permit, or even any upset provision can
anticipate all upset situations. After a certain point, the
transgression of regulatory limits caused by `uncontrollable acts of
third parties,' such as strikes, sabotage, operator intoxication or
insanity, and a variety of other eventualities, must be a matter for the
administrative exercise of case-by-case enforcement discretion, not for
specification in advance by regulation.''). In addition, emissions
during a malfunction event can be significantly higher than emissions at
any other time of source operation. For example, if an air pollution
control device with 99-percent removal goes off-line as a result of a
malfunction (as might happen if, for example, the bags in a baghouse
catch fire) and the emission unit is a steady state type unit that would
take days to shut down, the source would go from 99-percent control to
zero control until the control device was repaired. The source's
emissions during the malfunction would be 100 times higher than during
normal operations. As such, the emissions over a 4-day malfunction
period would exceed the annual emissions of the source during normal
operations. As this example illustrates, accounting for malfunctions
could lead to standards that are not reflective of (and significantly
less stringent than) levels that are achieved by a well-performing
non-malfunctioning source. It is reasonable to interpret CAA section 112
to avoid such a result. The EPA's approach to malfunctions is consistent
with CAA section 112 and is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.
Although no statutory language compels the EPA to set standards for
malfunctions, the EPA has the discretion to do so where feasible. For
example, in the Petroleum Refinery Sector RTR, the EPA established a
work practice standard for unique types of malfunction that result in
releases from pressure relief devices or emergency flaring events
because the EPA had information for that source category to determine
that such work practices reflected the level of control that applies to
the best performers. 80 FR 75178, 75211-14 (December 1, 2015). In the
proposed rulemaking for the PCWP, the EPA did not propose a work
practice standard for malfunctions but instead stated that the EPA would
consider whether circumstances warrant setting standards for a
particular type of malfunction and, if so, whether the EPA has
sufficient information to identify the relevant best performing sources
and establish a standard for such malfunctions. The EPA encouraged
commenters to provide any such information. Numerous comments were
received supporting and opposing the EPA's decision not to set a
standard for malfunctions. One commenter opposed to the EPA's decision
stated that there are several options the EPA could use[[Page 49446]]for
setting emission standards under CAA section 112 that would apply during
malfunction events. For example, the commenter stated that the EPA might
be able to establish a numerical emission limitation that applies at all
times but has an averaging time of sufficient duration that short,
infrequent spikes in emissions due to malfunctions would not cause the
source to exceed the emission limitation (while at the same time
ensuring that the source does not operate in a way that causes frequent,
lengthy excursions above the normal controlled emission rate). The EPA
also could use the flexibility accorded by CAA section 302(k) (which
defines ``emission limitation'' and ``emission standard'' to include
``any requirement relating to the operation or maintenance of a source
to ensure continuous emission reduction, and any design, equipment, work
practice or operational standard promulgated under'' the CAA) to address
emissions during malfunction events through operational requirements
rather than by applying the same limits on pollutant emissions that
apply during normal operations. Similarly, the commenter stated the EPA
has grounds to exercise its authority under CAA section 112(h) to
promulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard,
or combination thereof, because it is not feasible to prescribe or
enforce an emission standard. The commenter noted that even if the EPA
does not identify a set of specific work practices that all affected
facilities can follow that represent best practices for minimizing
emissions during malfunctions, the EPA might instead be able to address
malfunctions through a set of criteria that allows facilities to develop
and follow a site-specific plan for minimizing the extent and duration
of excess emissions during malfunctions. The commenter suggested that
the EPA might use several of these approaches in combination and stated
that accommodating malfunctions need not result in either an exemption
or an increased numerical emission limitation. The commenter urged the
EPA to use its authority under CAA sections 112 and 302(k) to address
malfunctions in a reasonable, CAA section 112-compliant manner.
Conversely, another commenter supported the EPA's proposed removal of
unlawful SSM exemptions in all forms because the CAA requires standards
to apply continuously, and the Court precedent is a development since
the prior standards were issued. After considering all comments, the EPA
is not finalizing a separate standard for periods of malfunction. In the
PCWP proposed rulemaking, we requested comment and information to
support the development of a work practice standard during periods of
malfunction, but we did not receive sufficient information, including
additional quantitative emissions data, on which to base a standard for
periods of malfunction. Absent sufficient information, it is not
reasonable at this time to establish a work practice standard for
malfunctions for this source category.4. Revisions to Table 10 to
Subpart DDDD of Part 63 The EPA proposed several specific revisions to
Table 10 to subpart DDDD of part 63 (the General Provisions table) to
establish standards in this rule that apply at all times. The EPA is
finalizing the amendments as proposed, with the clarifications noted in
the following sections. The specific revisions are described in the
remainder of this section.a. General Duty (40 CFR 63.2250) The EPA is
finalizing the General Provisions table (Table 10) entry for 40 CFR
63.6(e)(1) and (2) by redesignating it as 40 CFR 63.6(e)(1)(i) and
changing the ``yes'' in column 4 to a ``no'' in column 5 which was added
to specify requirements 1 year after the effective date of the final
amendments. Section 63.6(e)(1)(i) describes the general duty to minimize
emissions. Some of the language in that section is no longer necessary
or appropriate in light of the elimination of the SSM exemption. The EPA
is instead adding a general duty regulatory text at 40 CFR 63.2250 that
reflects the general duty to minimize emissions while eliminating the
reference to periods covered by an SSM exemption. The current language
in 40 CFR 63.6(e)(1)(i) characterizes what the general duty entails
during periods of SSM. With the elimination of the SSM exemption, there
is no need to differentiate between normal operations, startup and
shutdown, and malfunction events in describing the general duty.
Therefore, the language the EPA is finalizing for 40 CFR 63.2250 does
not include that language from 40 CFR 63.6(e)(1). The EPA is also
revising the General Provisions table (Table 10) by adding an entry for
40 CFR 63.6(e)(1)(ii) and including a ``no'' in column 5. Section
63.6(e)(1)(ii) imposes requirements that are not necessary with the
elimination of the SSM exemption or are redundant with the general duty
requirement being added at 40 CFR 63.2250 b. SSM Plan The EPA is
finalizing revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10) to add
an entry for 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3) by changing the ``yes'' in column 4 to a
``no'' in column 5. Generally, the paragraphs under 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3)
require development of an SSM plan and specify SSM recordkeeping and
reporting requirements related to the SSM plan. As noted, the EPA is
finalizing removal of the SSM exemptions. Therefore, affected units will
be subject to an emission standard during such events. The applicability
of a standard during such events will ensure that sources have ample
incentive to plan for and achieve compliance and, thus, the SSM plan
requirements are no longer necessary.c. Compliance With Standards The
EPA is finalizing revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.6(f)(1) by changing the ``yes'' in column 4 to a
``no'' in columns 4 and 5. The final revision in column 4 refers to 40
CFR 63.2250(a). The current language of 40 CFR 63.6(f)(1) exempts
sources from non-opacity standards during periods of SSM. As discussed
in section IV.C.1 of this preamble, the Court in Sierra Club v. EPA
vacated the exemptions contained in this provision and held that the CAA
requires that some CAA section 112 standards apply continuously.
Consistent with the Court decision, the EPA is finalizing the revised
standards in this rule to apply at all times. The EPA is finalizing
revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10) entry for 40 CFR
63.6(h)(1) through (9) by redesignating it as 40 CFR 63.6(h)(1) and
changing the ``NA'' in column 4 to a ``no'' in column 5. The current
language of 40 CFR 63.6(h)(1) exempts sources from opacity standards
during periods of SSM. As discussed in section IV.C.1 of this preamble,
the Court in Sierra Club vacated the exemptions contained in this
provision and held that the CAA requires that some CAA section 112
standards apply continuously. Consistent with the Court decision, the
EPA is finalizing the revised standards in this rule to apply at all
times.d. Performance Testing (40 CFR 63.2262) The EPA is finalizing
revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10) entry for 40 CFR
63.7(e)(1) by changing the ``yes'' in column 4 to a ``no'' in column 5.
Section 63.7(e)(1) describes performance testing requirements. The[[Page
49447]]EPA is finalizing instead the addition of a performance testing
requirement at 40 CFR 63.2262(a) and (b). The performance testing
requirements the EPA is adding differ from the General Provisions
performance testing provisions in several respects. The regulatory text
does not include the language in 40 CFR 63.7(e)(1) that restated the SSM
exemption. The finalized performance testing provisions remove reference
to 40 CFR 63.7(e)(1), reiterate the requirement that was already
included in the PCWP rule to conduct emissions tests under
representative operating conditions, and clarify that representative
operating conditions excludes periods of startup and shutdown. As in 40
CFR 63.7(e)(1), performance tests conducted under this subpart should
not be conducted during malfunctions because conditions during
malfunctions are not representative of normal operating conditions. The
EPA is finalizing added language that requires the owner or operator to
record the process information that is necessary to document operating
conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to
support that such conditions are representative. Section 63.7(e)
requires that the owner or operator make available to the Administrator
such records ``as may be necessary to determine the condition of the
performance test'' upon request but does not specifically require the
information to be recorded. The added regulatory text to this provision
that the EPA is finalizing builds on that requirement and makes explicit
the requirement to record the information. The EPA is also finalizing
the definition of ``representative operating conditions'' in 40 CFR
63.2292 to clarify that it excludes periods of startup and shutdown.
Representative operating conditions include a range of operating
conditions under which the process unit and control device typically
operate and are not limited to conditions of optimal performance of the
process unit and control device.e. Monitoring The EPA is finalizing
revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10) entry for 40 CFR
63.8(c)(1)(i) and (iii) by changing the ``yes'' in column 4 to a ``no''
in column 5. The cross-references to the general duty and SSM plan
requirements in those subparagraphs are not necessary in light of other
requirements of 40 CFR 63.8 that require good air pollution control
practices (40 CFR 63.8(c)(1)) and that set out the requirements of a
quality control program for monitoring equipment (40 CFR 63.8(d)). The
EPA is finalizing revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10)
by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.8(d)(3) and including a ``no'' in
column 5. The final sentence in 40 CFR 63.8(d)(3) refers to the General
Provisions' SSM plan requirement which is no longer applicable. The EPA
is finalizing adding to the rule at 40 CFR 63.2282(f) text that is
identical to 40 CFR 63.8(d)(3) except that the final sentence is
replaced with the following sentence: ``The program of corrective action
should be included in the plan required under 40 CFR 63.8(d)(2).''f.
Recordkeeping (40 CFR 63.2282) The EPA is finalizing revisions to the
General Provisions table (Table 10) entry for 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(i)
through (iv) by redesignating it as 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(i) and changing
the ``yes'' in column 4 to a ``no'' in column 5. Section 63.10(b)(2)(i)
describes the recordkeeping requirements during startup and shutdown.
The EPA is finalizing instead the addition of recordkeeping requirements
to 40 CFR 63.2282(a). When a source is subject to a different standard
during startup and shutdown, it will be important to know when such
startup and shutdown periods begin and end to determine compliance with
the appropriate standard. Thus, the EPA is finalizing adding language to
40 CFR 63.2282(a) requiring that sources subject to an emission standard
during startup or shutdown that differs from the emission standard that
applies at all other times must record the date, time, and duration of
such periods. The EPA is finalizing revisions to the General Provisions
table (Table 10) by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(ii) and
including a ``no'' in column 5. Section 63.10(b)(2)(ii) describes the
recordkeeping requirements during a malfunction. The EPA is finalizing
the addition of such requirements to 40 CFR 63.2282(a). The final
regulatory text the EPA is adding differs from the General Provisions it
is replacing in that the General Provisions requires the creation and
retention of a record of the occurrence and duration of each malfunction
of process, air pollution control, and monitoring equipment. The EPA is
finalizing this requirement to apply to any failure to meet an
applicable standard and is requiring that the source record the date,
time, and duration of the failure rather than the ``occurrence.'' The
EPA is also finalizing adding to 40 CFR 63.2282(a) a requirement that
sources keep records that include a list of the affected source or
equipment and actions taken to minimize emissions, an estimate of the
quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over the compliance option
in 40 CFR 63.2240 the source failed to meet (including the compliance
options in Table 1A or B to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, or the
emissions averaging compliance option), and a description of the method
used to estimate the emissions. Examples of such methods would include
product-loss calculations, mass balance calculations, measurements when
available, or engineering judgment based on known process parameters.
The EPA is finalizing the requirement that sources keep records of this
information to ensure that there is adequate information to allow the
EPA to determine the severity of any failure to meet a standard, and to
provide data that may document how the source met the general duty to
minimize emissions when the source has failed to meet an applicable
standard. For each failure to meet an operating requirement in Table 2
to subpart DDDD or work practice requirement in Table 3 to subpart DDDD,
facilities must maintain sufficient information to estimate the quantity
of each regulated pollutant emitted over the emission limit. This
information must be sufficient to provide a reliable emissions estimate
if requested by the Administrator. The EPA is finalizing revisions to
the General Provisions table (Table 10) by adding an entry for 40 CFR
63.10(b)(2)(iv) and including a ``no'' in column 5. When applicable, the
provision requires sources to record actions taken during SSM events
when actions were inconsistent with their SSM plan. The requirement is
no longer appropriate because SSM plans will no longer be required. The
requirement previously applicable under 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(iv)(B) to
record actions to minimize emissions and record corrective actions is
now applicable by reference to 40 CFR 63.2282(a). The EPA is finalizing
revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10) by adding 40 CFR
63.10(b)(2)(v) to the entry for 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(iv) and including a
``no'' in column 5. When applicable, the provision requires sources to
record actions taken during SSM events to show that actions taken were
consistent with their SSM plan. The requirement is no longer appropriate
because SSM plans will no longer be required. The EPA is finalizing
revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10) by adding an entry
for 40 CFR 63.10(c)(15) and including a ``no'' in column 5. The EPA is
finalizing that 40 CFR[[Page 49448]]63.10(c)(15) no longer apply. When
applicable, the provision allows an owner or operator to use the
affected source's SSM plan or records kept to satisfy the recordkeeping
requirements of the SSM plan, specified in 40 CFR 63.6(e), to also
satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 63.10(c)(10) through (12). The EPA is
finalizing eliminating this requirement because SSM plans would no
longer be required, and, therefore, 40 CFR 63.10(c)(15) no longer serves
any useful purpose for affected units.g. Reporting (40 CFR 63.2281) The
EPA is finalizing revisions to the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.10(d)(5) by redesignating it as 40 CFR
63.10(d)(5)(i) and changing the ``yes'' in column 4 to a ``no'' in
column 5. Section 63.10(d)(5)(i) describes the reporting requirements
for SSM events. To replace the General Provisions reporting requirement,
the EPA is finalizing adding reporting requirements to 40 CFR 63.2281(d)
and (e). The replacement language differs from the General Provisions
requirement in that it eliminates periodic SSM reports as a stand-alone
report. The EPA is finalizing language that requires sources that fail
to meet an applicable compliance option in 40 CFR 63.2240 at any time to
report the information concerning such events in the semiannual
compliance report already required under this rule. The EPA is
finalizing that the report must contain the number, date, time,
duration, and the cause of such events (including unknown cause, if
applicable), a list of the affected source or equipment, an estimate of
the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission
limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
Examples of such methods would include product-loss calculations, mass
balance calculations, measurements when available, or engineering
judgment based on known process parameters. The EPA is finalizing this
requirement to ensure that there is adequate information to determine
compliance, to allow the EPA to determine the severity of the failure to
meet an applicable standard, and to provide data that may document how
the source met the general duty to minimize emissions during a failure
to meet an applicable standard. A commenter on the proposed rulemaking
stated that facilities may not have information to estimate emissions
resulting from a deviation from an operating parameter limit (e.g , low
oxidizer or biofilter temperature), and requested that emissions
estimates only be required to be recorded or reported for failure to
meet an emission limit. As explained in the RTC document included in the
docket, EPA agrees that precise measurement of PCWP process unit
emissions during an operating requirement deviation under the PCWP
NESHAP is challenging unless the failure occurs during a performance
test. Therefore, 40 CFR 63.2281(e)(12) was updated for the final rule to
require reporting of an emission estimate only for failures to meet the
numerical emission compliance options in 40 CFR 63.2240, including the
compliance options in Table 1A or 1B of subpart DDDD or the emissions
averaging compliance option. As noted in section IV.C.4.f of this
preamble, 40 CFR 63.2282(a) requires recordkeeping of sufficient
information to provide an emissions estimate associated with failure to
meet an operating or work practice requirement, if requested by the
Administrator. The EPA will no longer require owners or operators to
determine whether actions taken to correct a malfunction are consistent
with an SSM plan, because plans would no longer be required. The
finalized amendments, therefore, eliminate the cross-reference to 40 CFR
63.10(d)(5)(i) that contains the description of the previously required
SSM report format and submittal schedule from this section. These
specifications are no longer necessary because the events will be
reported in otherwise required reports with similar format and submittal
requirements. The EPA is finalizing revisions to the General Provisions
table (Table 10) by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.10(d)(5)(ii) and
including a ``no'' in column 5. Section 63.10(d)(5)(ii) describes an
immediate report for SSM events when a source failed to meet an
applicable standard but did not follow the SSM plan. The EPA will no
longer require owners or operators to report when actions taken during
an SSM event were not consistent with an SSM plan, because plans would
no longer be required. Also, the EPA is removing and reserving 40 CFR
63.2281(e)(1) which required reporting of the date and time when each
malfunction started and stopped. As discussed in section IV.C.4.f of
this preamble, reporting is required for deviations from the applicable
standard as opposed to every malfunction occurrence regardless of
whether it results in a failure to meet the standard. Section 40 CFR
63.2281(e)(4) requires reporting of the date and time each deviation
started and stopped, and whether each deviation occurred during a period
of SSM.D. Electronic Reporting The EPA proposed that owners or operators
of PCWP facilities submit electronic copies of required performance test
reports, performance evaluation reports for continuous monitoring
systems (CMS) measuring relative accuracy test audit (RATA) pollutants
(i.e , total hydrocarbon monitors), selected notifications, and
semiannual reports through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) using
the CEDRI. The EPA proposed that performance test results collected
using test methods that are supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting
Tool (ERT) as listed on the ERT website \5\ at the time of the test be
submitted in the format generated through the use of the ERT and that
other performance test results be submitted in portable document format
(PDF) using the attachment module of the ERT. Similarly, performance
evaluation results of CMS measuring RATA pollutants that are supported
by the ERT at the time of the test would be submitted in the format
generated through the use of the ERT and other performance evaluation
results be submitted in PDF using the attachment module of the
ERT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\
https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/electronic-reporting-tool-ert.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the PCWP semiannual report, the EPA proposed that owners or
operators use a spreadsheet template to submit information to CEDRI. A
draft version of the spreadsheet template for this report was included
in the docket for the proposed rulemaking and the EPA specifically
requested comment on its content, layout, and overall design.\6\ The EPA
also proposed to require future initial notifications developed
according to 40 CFR 63.2280(b) and notifications of compliance status
developed according to 40 CFR 63.2280(d) to be uploaded in CEDRI in a
user-specified (e.g , PDF) format. In addition, the EPA proposed two
broad circumstances in which electronic reporting extensions may be
granted. In both circumstances, the decision to accept the claim of
needing additional time to report is within the discretion of the
Administrator, and reporting should occur as soon as possible. The EPA
proposed these potential extensions to protect owners or operators from
noncompliance in cases where they cannot successfully submit a report by
the reporting deadline for reasons[[Page 49449]]outside of their
control. The situation where an extension may be warranted due to
outages of the EPA's CDX or CEDRI which precludes an owner or operator
from accessing the system and submitting required reports is addressed
in 40 CFR 63.2281(k). The situation where an extension may be warranted
due to a force majeure event, which is defined as an event that will be
or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected
facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected
facility that prevents an owner or operator from complying with the
requirement to submit a report electronically as required by this rule
is addressed in 40 CFR 63.2281(l). Examples of such events are acts of
nature, acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazards
beyond the control of the
facility.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Products Semiannual Compliance Reporting Spreadsheet Template, Docket
Item No.
EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0176.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EPA received several comments regarding the proposed electronic
reporting requirements, including favorable comments and comments
suggesting revisions. The electronic reporting requirements are included
in the final rule as proposed with clarification of specific questions
raised by commenters. Specific comments pertaining to the draft
spreadsheet template are detailed in the RTC document along with the
EPA's responses explaining how these comments were used to improve the
template. A revised version of the semiannual electronic reporting
spreadsheet template is available in the docket for the final rule. One
commenter requested that the requirement to use a CEDRI form should not
begin until after the form has been available in CEDRI for at least 1
year. The commenter also recommended that the transition to using the
new reporting form apply to an entire reporting period, not come into
effect in the middle of a reporting period and result in two different
reports being prepared. In response to this comment, we revised the
final rule to specify use of the semiannual reporting template for the
first full reporting period after it has been available on the CEDRI
website for 1 year. Refer to section IV.J of this preamble for more
discussion of the compliance timeline. The EPA proposed a conforming
amendment in Table 9 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, to require
submittal of CMS performance evaluations according to the electronic
reporting provisions for performance evaluations proposed in 40 CFR
63.2281(j). One commenter requested that the EPA clarify that CMS
performance evaluations should be submitted only for continuous emission
monitoring systems (CEMS) and not for continuous parameter monitoring
systems. In response to these requests for clarification, we revised
Table 9 to subpart DDDD to refer to state the CMS performance evaluation
to be reported is the performance evaluation required for CEMS under 40
CFR 63.2269(d)(2). As discussed in section IV.G of this preamble, for
the final rule, we also revised Table 10 of subpart DDDD to clarify that
the CMS performance evaluation provisions in 40 CFR 63.8(e) and the RATA
provisions in 40 CFR 63.8(f)(6) only apply for CEMS under subpart
DDDD.E. Repeat Emissions Testing As part of an ongoing effort to improve
compliance with federal air emission regulations, the EPA reviewed the
emissions testing requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, and
proposed to require facilities complying with the standards in Table 1B
of 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, using an add-on control system other
than a biofilter to conduct repeat emissions performance testing every 5
years. Currently, facilities operating add-on controls are required to
conduct an initial performance test by the date specified in 40 CFR
63.2261(a). In addition to the initial performance test, process units
controlled by biofilters are already required by the PCWP NESHAP to
conduct repeat performance testing every 2 years. Periodic performance
tests for all types of control systems are already required by
permitting authorities for many facilities. Further, the EPA believes
that requiring repeat performance tests will help to ensure that control
systems are properly maintained over time. As proposed in Table 7 to 40
CFR part 63, subpart DDDD (row 7), the first of the repeat performance
tests would be required to be conducted within 3 years of the effective
date of the revised standards or within 5 years (60 months) following
the previous performance test, whichever is later, and thereafter within
60 months following the previous performance test. Section IV.J of this
preamble provides more information on compliance dates. The EPA
specifically requested comments on the proposed requirements for repeat
performance testing. One commenter agreed with the proposed requirements
and stated they are well supported and legally required as part of
meeting the EPA's statutory obligations. The EPA received other comments
requesting clarification of the requirements surrounding repeat testing.
One commenter requested clarification with regards to whether the repeat
testing is to include press capture efficiency testing and requested due
to cost, that repeat press capture efficiency testing only be required
if an alteration has been made to the enclosure that would significantly
affect its efficacy. In response to this comment, a footnote was added
to Table 7 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, clarifying that capture
efficiency demonstration is not required with repeat performance tests
if the capture device is maintained and operated consistent with its
design as well as its operation during the previous capture efficiency
demonstration conducted according to Table 4 to subpart DDDD, row 9 as
specified in 40 CFR 63.2267 \7\ Aside from this clarification, the
proposed requirements for repeat emissions testing every 5 years for
add-on controls other than biofilters are included in the final rule as
proposed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ The footnote added to Table 7 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD,
clarifying when capture efficiency testing is required was included for
biofilters and other control devices undergoing repeat emissions
testing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two commenters requested more flexibility for catalytic oxidizer
catalyst checks required by the rule given the added repeat testing
requirements. The commenters requested the frequency of catalyst checks
be revised to ``annual'' or no more than every 15 months and requested
the requirement for catalyst checks be eliminated during years when
emissions tests are conducted. In response to these comments, the EPA
revised Tables 2 and 7 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, to refer to
``annual'' catalyst checks and included a footnote stating that
facilities may forego the annual catalyst activity check during the
calendar year when a performance test conducted according to Table 4 to
subpart DDDD. The final rule requires that, in each calendar year,
either a performance test or a catalyst activity check must be
conducted. One commenter requested clarification that the Notification
of Compliance Status (NCS) is only required with the initial performance
test, not with each repeat performance test. As explained further in the
RTC document, a NCS is required with initial and repeat performance
tests under 40 CFR 63.9 In response to this comment, the EPA deleted the
word ``initial'' from 40 CFR 63.2280(d) and added a phrase mentioning
the ``repeat performance test as specified in Table 7 to this subpart''
so it is clearer that a NCS is required when performing repeat testing
according to the methods in Table 4 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD. The
EPA also deleted the word ``initial'' and added a reference to Table 7
to subpart DDDD (which includes repeat testing in[[Page 49450]]rows 3
and 7) to 40 CFR 63.2280(d)(2) and clarified that the NCS only needs to
have ``a summary of'' the performance test results submitted according
to the electronic performance test reporting provisions in 40 CFR
63.2281(i).F. Biofilter Bed Temperature Facilities using a biofilter to
comply with the PCWP NESHAP must monitor biofilter bed temperature and
maintain the 24-hour block biofilter bed temperature within the range
established during performance testing showing compliance with the
emission limits. As originally promulgated, the upper and lower limits
of the biofilter bed temperature were required to be established as the
highest and lowest 15-minute average bed temperatures, respectively,
during the three test runs. Facilities may conduct multiple performance
tests to expand the biofilter bed operating temperature range. See 40
CFR 63.2262(m). The EPA learned that multiple facilities are having
difficulty complying with the PCWP biofilter bed temperature monitoring
requirements established according to the original rule. Biofilter bed
temperature is affected by ambient temperature which cannot always be
accurately predicted in advance of scheduling performance tests. In
consideration of this issue, as discussed in the preamble for the
proposed amendments (at 84 FR 47097), the EPA proposed to revise 40 CFR
63.2262(m)(1) to add a 5-percent variability margin to the biofilter bed
temperature upper and lower limits established during emissions testing.
Commenters on the proposal stated that the proposed 5-percent
variability margin is insufficient, particularly on the lower end of the
biofilter bed temperature range and recommended instead that the EPA
provide a wider margin allowance or extend the operating limit averaging
period beyond the current 24-hour period. The commenters stated that,
unlike other common air pollution control devices with operating
parameters that can be controlled within a small percentage of set point
and are not subject to ambient atmospheric conditions, biofilters are
influenced by diurnal, day-to-day, and seasonal ambient temperature
variations because they are typically located outside due to their size.
They further stated that in practical terms, in order to set the widest
bed temperature range, a facility must test on the coldest and the
hottest day of the year, yet predicting those days is not possible and
is further complicated by the fact that stack test teams and permitting
agencies must be given months of advance notice when scheduling a test.
To address the commenters' concern that a 5-percent variability margin
is insufficient, the EPA increased the variability margin to 10 percent
for the final rule with the stipulation that the variability margin not
exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit ([deg]F) on the upper end of the biofilter
bed range. As noted in the memorandum, Review of Select
Biofilter/Bioscrubber Data Submitted in Response to the Plywood and
Composite Wood Products Information Collection Request, Docket Item No.
EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0188, the biofilter bed temperature across all of
the biofilters in the PCWP industry spans from 40 [deg]F to 150 [deg]F.
On the low end of this range, 5 percent is 2 [deg]F while 10 percent is
4 [deg]F. On the high end of the range, 5 percent is 8 [deg]F while 10
percent is 15 [deg]F. The upper-end value of 15 [deg]F added to 150
[deg]F would allow the facility to operate at 165 [deg]F, which the EPA
considers excessive in the absence of data showing this temperature is
not detrimental to the microbial population. Therefore, for the final
rule, the EPA capped the variability margin for the high end of the
biofilter bed temperature range at 8 [deg]F (which coincides with the
margin proposed). Thus, for the high-end biofilter bed temperature,
facilities may add up to 10 percent, not to exceed 8 [deg]F. The EPA
anticipates that facilities currently having difficulty maintaining the
biofilter bed temperature limits may wish to adjust their temperature
limits. As originally promulgated, 40 CFR 63.2262(m)(1) states that
facilities may base their biofilter bed temperature range on values
recorded during previous performance tests provided that the data used
to establish the temperature ranges have been obtained using the
required test methods; and that facilities using data from previous
performance tests must certify that the biofilter and associated process
unit(s) have not been modified since the test. This provision (if met)
clarifies that facilities can adjust their previously established
biofilter temperature range to include the 5-percent variability margin,
if desired.G. Thermocouple Calibration At 40 CFR 63.2269(b)(4), the PCWP
NESHAP currently requires conducting an electronic calibration of the
temperature monitoring device at least semiannually according to the
procedures in the manufacturer's owner's manual. Stakeholders with
facilities subject to the standard explained to the EPA that they are
unaware of a thermocouple manufacturer that provides procedures for
conducting electronic calibration of thermocouples. According to
stakeholders, facilities have been replacing thermocouples because they
cannot electronically calibrate them. The stakeholders requested the EPA
consider an alternative approach to the current requirement in 40 CFR
63.2269(b)(4). To address this issue, the EPA proposed revisions to 40
CFR 63.2269(b)(4) to allow multiple alternative approaches to
thermocouple validation. The EPA received comments supporting the
proposed revisions to 40 CFR 63.2269(b)(4) and we are promulgating these
revisions as proposed with minor clarifications. In response to a
comment that the word ``calibration'' be removed from 40 CFR
63.2269(b)(5), the EPA is amending this paragraph to replace
``calibration and validation checks'' with ``validation checks'' and to
specify that validation checks be conducted using the procedures in 40
CFR 63.2269(b)(4). One commenter requested the EPA to clarify that
temperature sensor validations are not performance evaluations requiring
formal notification and reporting under 40 CFR 63.8 For the final rule,
the EPA has revised Table 10 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, to clarify
that the CMS performance evaluation provisions in 40 CFR 63.8(e) and the
RATA provisions in 40 CFR 63.8(f)(6) only apply for CEMS under subpart
DDDD.H. Non-HAP Coating Definition The EPA proposed to replace the
references to Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA)-defined carcinogens and 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) in the PCWP
``non-HAP coating'' definition with a reference to a new appendix B to
40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD. The proposed appendix listed the specific
carcinogenic HAP that must be below 0.1 percent by mass for a PCWP
coating to be considered a non-HAP coating. One commenter stated that
the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) (29 CFR 1910.1200(g)), revised
in 2012, requires that a chemical manufacturer, distributor, or importer
provide a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) (formerly MSDSs or Material Safety
Data Sheets) for each hazardous chemical to downstream users, and that
PCWP facilities rely on SDSs to identify whether coatings contain
carcinogens. The commenter stated that if the EPA finalizes a separate
list of HAP in appendix B to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, there will be
no certainty as to whether non-HAP coatings are being used because of
the[[Page 49451]]discrepancy in HAP listed on SDSs (per the HCS) and in
appendix B to subpart DDDD. The commenter suggested the EPA should
remove appendix B to subpart DDDD and instead reference the OSHA SDS
requirements for classification of carcinogenicity at 29 CFR 1910.1200,
appendix A, section A.6.4, which match the requirements in the now
obsolete OSHA regulatory reference proposed for deletion from the PCWP
non-HAP coating definition. The EPA agrees that referencing appendix A
to 29 CFR 1910.1200 in the PCWP rule's non-HAP coating definition is a
more streamlined approach for the PCWP NESHAP than use of the proposed
appendix B to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD. The OSHA language the PCWP
proposal sought to replace is in appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1200, section
A.6.4 For the final PCWP amendments, the EPA is defining non-HAP coating
to mean a coating with HAP contents below 0.1 percent by mass for
OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in section A.6.4 of appendix A to
29 CFR 1910.1200 and below 1.0 percent by mass for other HAP compounds.
As a result of the new reference, the proposed appendix B is not being
finalized.I. Technical and Editorial Changes The EPA is finalizing the
following technical and editorial changes to the final rule as proposed:
The clarifying reference to ``SSM plans'' in 40 CFR 63.2252 was removed
because SSM plans would no longer be applicable after the date specified
in 40 CFR 63.2250(c); the redundant reference in 40 CFR 63.2281(c)(6)
for submittal of performance test results with the compliance report was
eliminated because performance test results would be required to be
electronically reported; the EPA revised 40 CFR 63.2281(d)(2) and added
language to 40 CFR 63.2281(e) introductory text and (e)(12) and (13) to
make these paragraphs more consistent to facilitate electronic
reporting; a provision stating that the EPA retains authority to approve
alternatives to electronic reporting was added to 40 CFR 63.2291(c)(5);
cross-references to the 40 CFR part 60 appendices containing test
methods were updated in Table 4 of the rule; cross-references were
updated throughout the rule, as needed, to match the proposed changes;
cross-references to 40 CFR 63.14 were updated to remove outdated
paragraph references; the equation number cross-referenced in the
definition of ``MSF'' was corrected; and the cross-reference in 40 CFR
63.2290 was updated to include all sections of the General Provisions.J.
Compliance Dates The EPA proposed that existing affected sources and
other affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction on
or before September 6, 2019, must comply with all of the amendments 6
months (180 days) after the effective date of the final rule.\8\ The EPA
also proposed the addition of electronic reporting requirements that
will require use of a semiannual reporting template once the template
has been available on the CEDRI website
(https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/compliance-and-emissions-data-reporting-interface-cedri)
for 6 months. New requirements to conduct repeat performance testing
every 5 years for facilities using an add-on control system other than a
biofilter (see section IV.E of this preamble) were also proposed. The
first of the repeat performance tests would be required to be conducted
within 3 years after the effective date of the revised standards, or
within 5 years (60 months) following the previous performance test,
whichever is later, and thereafter within 60 months following the
previous performance test. The EPA specifically requested comment on
whether the proposed compliance times provide enough time for owners or
operators to comply with the proposed amendments, and if the proposed
time window is not adequate, requested that commenters provide an
explanation of specific actions that would need to be undertaken to
comply with the proposed amended requirements and the time needed to
make the adjustments for compliance with any of the revised
requirements.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ The final action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C
804(2), therefore, the effective date of the final rule is the
promulgation date as specified in CAA section
112(d)(10).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One commenter stated that the 180 days proposed by the EPA for existing
facilities to comply with all of the proposed amendments is not enough
time to complete all of the activities that must be done in order to
effect a smooth transition to the new requirements, including:
Developing a site-specific implementation plan; implementing new startup
and shutdown procedures; reprogramming of electronic systems and
automated alarms to account for the removal of SSM provisions and the
addition of new startup and shutdown related work practices; reworking
recordkeeping and reporting systems to match the layout of the new CEDRI
form (e.g , breaking out reporting by individual equipment instead of by
process group); developing and communicating guidance to ensure
consistent implementation across a company's facilities; preparing
permit applications and acquiring revised air permits to reflect the
elimination of SSM provisions and addition of new requirements;
developing procedures for estimating excess emissions due to deviations;
and developing and providing training for facility staff on the revised
requirements. The commenter further stated that applying for and
receiving a permit revision to reflect the revised requirements alone
will likely take more than 180 days and expressed concern that if
additional time is not provided and if current permit language conflicts
with the final RTR rule, facilities will have to determine how to comply
with both the old requirements and the new requirements. The commenter
also noted that working with information technology support staff to
re-program a facility's electronic systems to align with the new
requirements is an effort that takes more than 180 days to plan and
implement. After considering the public comments, the EPA recognizes
that 180 days is not practicable for completion of the steps needed to
implement the PCWP rule changes given the complexity of operations in
the PCWP source category. The PCWP industry involves manufacturing of
several different products, using a variety of process unit and control
system combinations that differ from facility to facility. As documented
in the technology review, the PCWP processes and controls at many mills
are highly interconnected (e.g , where multiple different types of
process units are routed to the same control device; process units of
one type are routed through process units of a different type to
emissions control; or where the furnace that provides process heat is
also part of the air pollution control system for some processes). The
interconnectivity of processes and fire-prevention systems needed for
processing wood requires a high degree of automation and interconnection
in the programmable logic controllers and data acquisition systems (DAS)
tailored to each PCWP plant site. Some companies have one PCWP facility
while others have more than 10 facilities manufacturing different PCWP
products using a variety of equipment[[Page 49452]]configurations. The
EPA understands that companies with numerous PCWP facilities need time
for corporate coordination of IT programming resources across multiple
uniquely configured plant sites, while companies with fewer facilities
have more-limited environmental staff that are sometimes shared across
two or three PCWP facilities to oversee reprogramming. The EPA has
concluded that 1 year following the effective date of the final
amendments is the most expeditious compliance period practicable for
existing PCWP affected sources to make the DAS adjustments needed to
demonstrate compliance with the revised requirements during startup and
shutdown periods and to transition to electronic reporting. All existing
affected facilities will have to continue to meet the current
requirements of the NESHAP until the applicable compliance date of the
amended rule. Affected sources that commence construction or
reconstruction after September 6, 2019 (the publication date of the
proposed rulemaking) must comply with all requirements of the subpart,
including the final amendments, no later than the effective date of the
final rule or upon initial startup, whichever is later. Regarding the
compliance timeline for semiannual reporting, the EPA received comments
requesting that the new requirements come into effect at the beginning
of a semiannual reporting period, and not in the middle of a reporting
period to avoid two different reports being prepared. The EPA recognizes
that there can be a transitional compliance period because of the way
the effective date of the final PCWP rule is set as the date of
publication of the final Federal Register document. During this
transitional period for existing sources, the previously promulgated
rule requirements must be met until the compliance date (e.g ,
compliance with the SSM plan), and then the newly promulgated
requirements must be met thereafter. The EPA anticipates that this
transitional semiannual reporting period will occur before the PCWP
semiannual electronic reporting spreadsheet is required to be used. To
ensure this, we have revised the final rule to specify use of the
semiannual reporting template for the first full reporting period after
it has been available on the CEDRI website for 1 year. Regarding the
compliance timeline for repeat emissions testing, the compliance dates
are included in the final rule as proposed. No comments were received
regarding the compliance dates for repeat emissions testing. As
proposed, the first of the repeat performance tests must be conducted
within 3 years after August 13, 2020, or within 60 months following the
previous performance test, whichever is later.V. Summary of Cost,
Environmental, and Economic Impacts and Additional Analyses ConductedA.
What are the affected facilities? As noted in the preamble to the
proposed amendments, the EPA identified 230 facilities that are
operating and subject to the PCWP NESHAP. This includes 109 facilities
manufacturing one or more PCWP products (e.g , plywood, veneer,
particleboard, OSB, hardboard, fiberboard, MDF, engineered wood
products) and 121 facilities that produce kiln-dried lumber. Sixteen
facilities produce PCWP products and kiln-dried lumber. Information on
operational facilities is included in the Technology Review for the
Plywood and Composite Wood Products NESHAP, available as Docket Item No.
EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0189. In addition, the EPA is aware of 13
greenfield facilities (four PCWP and nine kiln-dried lumber mills) that
recently commenced construction as major sources of HAP emissions. The
EPA is projecting that two new OSB mills will be constructed as major
sources within the next 5 years, and that existing facilities will add
or replace process units during this same time frame. More details on
our projections of new sources are available in Projections of the
Number of New and Reconstructed Sources for the Subpart DDDD Technology
Review, available as Docket Item No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0182.B. What
are the air quality impacts? The nationwide baseline HAP emissions from
the 230 facilities in the PCWP source category are estimated to be 7,600
tpy. Emissions of the six compounds defined as ``total HAP'' in the PCWP
NESHAP (acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde, methanol, phenol, and
propionaldehyde) make up 96 percent of the nationwide emissions. The
amendments include removal of the SSM exemption and addition of repeat
emissions testing for controls other than biofilters (which already
require repeat tests). Although the EPA is unable to quantify the
emission reduction associated with these changes, we expect that
emissions will be reduced by requiring facilities to meet the applicable
standard during periods of SSM and that the repeat emissions testing
requirements will encourage operation of add-on controls to achieve
optimum performance. The EPA is not finalizing other revisions to the
emission limits that would impact emissions, so there are no
quantifiable air quality impacts resulting from the final amendments.C.
What are the cost impacts? No capital costs are estimated to be incurred
to comply with the final amendments. The costs associated with the final
amendments are related to recordkeeping and reporting labor costs and
repeat performance testing. Because repeat performance testing is
required every 5 years, costs are estimated and summarized over a 5-year
period. The nationwide cost of the final amendments is estimated to
include a one-time cost of $1.3 million for facilities to review the
revised rule and make record systems adjustments and a cost of $3.5
million every 5 years for repeat emissions testing. These costs are in
2018 dollars. Another metric for presenting the one-time costs is as a
present value (PV), which is a technique that converts a stream of costs
over time into a one-time estimate for the present year or other year.
The EPA estimates that the PV of costs for these final amendments is
$5.6 million at a discount rate of 7 percent and $6.9 million at a
discount rate of 3 percent. In addition, the EPA presents these costs as
an equivalent annualized value (EAV) in order to provide an estimate of
annual costs consistent with the PV. The EAV for these final amendments
is estimated to be $0.9 million at a discount rate of 7 percent and $1.0
million at a discount rate of 3 percent. The PV and EAV cost estimates
are in 2016 dollars, in part, to conform to Executive Order 13771
requirements. These estimates have not changed since the proposal. For
further information on the costs associated with the amendments, see the
memorandum, Cost, Environmental, and Energy Impacts of Regulatory
Options for Subpart DDDD, Docket Item No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0184, and
the memorandum, Economic Impact and Small Business Analysis for the
Proposed Plywood and Composite Wood Products Risk and Technology Review
(RTR) NESHAP, Docket Item No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0185.D. What are the
economic impacts? The EPA estimated that none of the ultimate parent
owners affected by the proposed amendments would incur annualized costs
of 1.0 percent or greater of their revenues, and that estimate has not
changed since proposal. Thus, these economic impacts are low for
affected companies and the[[Page 49453]]industries impacted by this
action, and there will not be substantial impacts in the markets for
affected products. For more information on the economic impact analysis
conducted for the proposal, see the memorandum titled Economic Impact
and Small Business Analysis for the Proposed Plywood and Composite Wood
Risk and Technology Review (RTR) NESHAP, Docket Item No.
EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0185.E. What are the benefits? The EPA is not
finalizing changes to emissions limits, except to the extent necessary
to make them applicable during SSM periods and to establish work
practice requirements for certain startup and shutdown periods. The EPA
estimates the final amendments (i.e , changes to SSM, recordkeeping,
reporting, and monitoring) are not economically significant. Because
these amendments are not considered economically significant, as defined
by Executive Order 12866, and because no emissions reductions were
estimated, the EPA did not estimate any benefits from reducing
emissions.F. What analysis of environmental justice did we conduct?
Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994) establishes
federal executive policy on environmental justice. Its main provision
directs federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and
permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by
identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs,
policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income
populations in the United States. To examine the potential for any
environmental justice issues that might be associated with the source
category, the EPA performed a demographic analysis, which is an
assessment of risks to individual demographic groups of the populations
living within 5 kilometers (km) and within 50 km of the facilities. In
the analysis, we evaluated the distribution of HAP-related cancer and
noncancer risks from each source category across different demographic
groups within the populations living near facilities. The results of the
PCWP source category demographic analysis indicate that emissions from
the source category expose approximately 200,000 people to a cancer risk
at or above 1-in-1 million and zero people to a chronic noncancer TOSHI
greater than 1. The percentages of the at-risk population in four of the
11 demographic groups (African American, Native American, below poverty
level, and over 25 without a high school diploma) are greater than their
respective nationwide percentages. The methodology and the results of
the demographic analysis are presented in the technical report, Risk and
Technology Review--Analysis of Demographic Factors for Populations
Living Near Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category, Docket
Item No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243-0181.G. What analysis of children's
environmental health did we conduct? The EPA does not believe the
environmental health or safety risks addressed by this action present a
disproportionate risk to children. This action's health and risk
assessments are contained in the Residual Risk Assessment for the
Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category in Support of the
2019 Risk and Technology Review Final Rule, available in the docket for
this action, Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243.VI. Statutory and
Executive Order Reviews Additional information about these statutes and
Executive Orders can be found at
https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/laws-and-executive-orders.A.
Executive Orders 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive
Order 13563: Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review This action is
not a significant regulatory action and was, therefore, not submitted to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review.B. Executive Order
13771: Reducing Regulations and Controlling Regulatory Cost This action
is not an Executive Order 13771 regulatory action because this action is
not significant under Executive Order 12866.C. Paperwork Reduction Act
(PRA) The information collection activities in this final rule have been
submitted for approval to OMB under the PRA. The ICR document that the
EPA prepared has been assigned EPA ICR number 1984.09 You can find a
copy of the ICR in the docket for this rule, and it is briefly
summarized here. The information collection requirements are not
enforceable until OMB approves them. The information is being collected
to assure compliance with 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD. The information
requirements are based on notification, recordkeeping, and reporting
requirements in the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart
A), which are mandatory for all operators subject to national emissions
standards. The information collection activities also include paperwork
requirements associated with initial and repeat performance testing and
parameter monitoring. The final amendments to the rule eliminate the
paperwork requirements associated with the SSM plan and recordkeeping of
SSM events and require electronic submittal of performance test results
and semiannual compliance reports. These recordkeeping and reporting
requirements are specifically authorized by CAA section 114 (42 U.S.C
7414). Respondents/affected entities: Owners or operators of facilities
subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, that produce plywood, composite
wood products, or kiln-dried lumber. Respondent's obligation to respond:
Mandatory (40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD). Estimated number of
respondents: 244 facilities (including existing and new facilities
projected to begin reporting during the ICR period). Frequency of
response: The frequency varies depending on the type of response (e.g ,
initial notification, semiannual compliance report). Total estimated
burden: 39,700 hours (per year). Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b).
Total estimated cost: $6,930,000 (per year), includes $2,365,000
annualized capital or operation and maintenance costs. An agency may not
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB
control number. The OMB control numbers for the EPA's regulations in 40
CFR are listed in 40 CFR part 9. When OMB approves this ICR, the Agency
will announce that approval in the Federal Register and publish a
technical amendment to 40 CFR part 9 to display the OMB control number
for the approved information collection activities contained in this
final rule.D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) I certify that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the RFA. In making this determination,
the impact of concern is any significant adverse economic impact on
small entities. An agency may certify that a rule will not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
if[[Page 49454]]the rule relieves regulatory burden, has no net burden,
or otherwise has a positive economic effect on the small entities
subject to the rule. Of the 69 ultimate parent entities that are subject
to the rule, 28 are small according to the Small Business
Administration's small business size standards and standards regarding
other entities (e.g , federally recognized tribes). None of the affected
28 small entities have annualized costs of 1 percent or greater of
sales. The EPA has, therefore, concluded that this action will not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.E.
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) This action does not contain an
unfunded mandate of $100 million or more as described in UMRA, 2 U.S.C
1531-1538, and does not significantly or uniquely affect small
governments. While this action creates an enforceable duty on the
private sector, the cost does not exceed $100 million or more.F.
Executive Order 13132: Federalism This action does not have federalism
implications. It will not have substantial direct effects on the states,
on the relationship between the National Government and the states, or
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various
levels of government.G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and
Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments This action does not have
tribal implications as specified in Executive Order 13175. It will not
have substantial direct effects on tribal governments, on the
relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the
distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal
Government and Indian tribes. No tribal governments own facilities that
are impacted by the proposed changes to the NESHAP. Thus, Executive
Order 13175 does not apply to this action.H. Executive Order 13045:
Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks
This action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not
economically significant as defined in Executive Order 12866, and
because the EPA does not believe the environmental health or safety
risks addressed by this action present a disproportionate risk to
children. This action's health and risk assessments are discussed in
sections III and IV of this preamble and further documented in the risk
report titled Residual Risk Assessment for the Plywood and Composite
Wood Products Source Category in Support of the 2019 Risk and Technology
Review Final Rule, which can be found in the docket for this action.I.
Executive Order 13211: Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly
Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use This action is not subject to
Executive Order 13211, because it is not a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866.J. National Technology Transfer and
Advancement Act (NTTAA) and 1 CFR Part 51 This action involves technical
standards. The EPA is finalizing the use of the standards currently
listed in Table 4 of the rule (40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD). The EPA is
amending 40 CFR 63.14 to incorporate by reference EPA Method 0011 for
measurement of formaldehyde. Method 0011 is applicable to the
determination of destruction and removal efficiency of analytes
including formaldehyde and other compounds. Pollutants withdrawn
isokinetically from the emission source and are collected in aqueous
acidic 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Formaldehyde present in the emission
stream reacts to form a derivative that extracted, solvent-exchanged,
concentrated, and then analyzed by high performance liquid
chromatography. The SW-846 Method 0011 (Revision 0, December 1996) is
available in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical
Methods'', EPA Publication No. SW-846. This method was included in the
PCWP rule when it was promulgated in 2004 and is reasonably available
from the EPA at https://www.epa.gov/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium. Under 40
CFR 63.7(f) and 40 CFR 63.8(f) of subpart A of the General Provisions, a
source may apply to the EPA for permission to use alternative test
methods or alternative monitoring requirements in place of any required
testing methods, performance specifications, or procedures in the final
rule or any amendments. The following standards, referenced in the
regulatory text, are already approved for incorporation by reference at
their respective locations: NCASI Method CI/WP-98.01; NCASI Method
IM/CAN/WP-99.02; NCASI Method ISS/FP-A105.01; ASTM D6348-03.K. Executive
Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations The EPA believes that
this action does not have disproportionately high and adverse human
health or environmental effects on minority populations, low income
populations, and/or indigenous peoples, as specified in Executive Order
12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). The documentation for this
decision is contained in section IV.A.6 of the preamble to the proposed

source, whichever is later. For all other affected sources, this
paragraph (c) does not apply on and after August 13, 2021.* * * * * (e)
You must be in compliance with the provisions of subpart A of this part,
except as noted in Table 10 to this subpart. (f) Upon August 13, 2020 or
initial startup of the affected source, whichever is later, for affected
sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after September 6,
2019, and on and after August 13, 2021 for all other affected sources,
you must be in compliance with the compliance options, operating
requirements, and the work practice requirements in this subpart when
the process unit(s) subject to the compliance options, operating
requirements, and work practice requirements are operating, except as
specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (6) of this section. (1) Prior to
process unit initial startup. (2) During safety-related shutdowns
conducted according to the work practice requirement in Table 3 to this
subpart. (3) During pressurized refiner startup and shutdown according
to the work practice requirement in Table 3 to this subpart. (4) During
startup and shutdown of direct-fired softwood veneer dryer gas-fired
burners according to the work practice requirement in Table 3 to this
subpart. (5) You must minimize the length of time when compliance
options and operating requirements in this subpart are not met due to
the conditions in paragraphs (f)(2) and (4) of this section. (6) The
applicable standard during each of the operating conditions specified in
paragraphs (f)(2) through (4) of this section are the work practice
requirements in Table 3 to this subpart for safety-related shutdowns
(row 6), pressurized refiner startup and shutdown (row 7), and
direct-fired softwood veneer dryers undergoing startup or shutdown of

(g) For affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction
after September 6, 2019, and for all other affected sources on and after
August 13, 2021, you must always operate and maintain your affected
source, including air pollution control and monitoring equipment in a
manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for
minimizing emissions at least to the levels required by this subpart.
The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any
further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable
standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is
operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will
be based on information available to the Administrator which may
include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation
and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records,
and inspection of the source.06. Section 63.2252 is revised to read as
follows:[[Page 49456]]Sec. 63.2252 What are the requirements for process
units that have no control or work practice requirements? For process
units not subject to the compliance options or work practice
requirements specified in Sec. 63.2240 (including, but not limited to,
lumber kilns), you are not required to comply with the compliance
options, work practice requirements, performance testing, monitoring,
and recordkeeping or reporting requirements of this subpart, or any
other requirements in subpart A of this part, except for the initial
notification requirements in Sec. 63.9(b).07. Section 63.2262 is amended
by revising paragraphs (a), (b), (m)(1), and (n)(1) to read as
follows:Sec. 63.2262 How do I conduct performance tests and establish
operating requirements? (a) Testing procedures. You must conduct each
performance test according to the requirements in paragraphs (b) through
(o) of this section and according to the methods specified in Table 4 to
this subpart. (b) Periods when performance tests must be conducted. You
must conduct each performance test based on representative performance
(i.e , performance based on representative operating conditions as
defined in Sec. 63.2292) of the affected source for the period being
tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and
shutdown. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of
malfunction. You must describe representative operating conditions in
your performance test report for the process and control systems and
explain why they are representative. You must record the process
information that is necessary to document operating conditions during
the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such
conditions are representative. Upon request, you shall make available to
the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the
conditions of performance tests.* * * * * (m) * * * (1) During the
performance test, you must continuously monitor the biofilter bed
temperature during each of the required 1-hour test runs. To monitor
biofilter bed temperature, you may use multiple thermocouples in
representative locations throughout the biofilter bed and calculate the
average biofilter bed temperature across these thermocouples prior to
reducing the temperature data to 15-minute averages for purposes of
establishing biofilter bed temperature limits. The biofilter bed
temperature range must be established as the temperature values 10
percent below the minimum and 10 percent (not to exceed 8[deg] F) above
the maximum 15-minute biofilter bed temperatures monitored during the
three test runs. You may base your biofilter bed temperature range on
values recorded during previous performance tests provided that the data
used to establish the temperature ranges have been obtained using the
test methods required in this subpart. If you use data from previous
performance tests, you must certify that the biofilter and associated
process unit(s) have not been modified subsequent to the date of the
performance tests. Replacement of the biofilter media with the same type
of material is not considered a modification of the biofilter for
purposes of this section.* * * * * (n) * * * (1) During the performance
test, you must identify and document the process unit controlling
parameter(s) that affect total HAP emissions during the three-run
performance test. The controlling parameters you identify must coincide
with the representative operating conditions you describe according to
paragraph (b) of this section. For each parameter, you must specify
appropriate monitoring methods, monitoring frequencies, and for
continuously monitored parameters, averaging times not to exceed 24
hours. The operating limit for each controlling parameter must then be
established as the minimum, maximum, range, or average (as appropriate
depending on the parameter) recorded during the performance test.
Multiple three-run performance tests may be conducted to establish a
range of parameter values under different operating conditions.* * * *
*08. Section 63.2269 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) to
read as follows:Sec. 63.2269 What are my monitoring installation,
operation, and maintenance requirements?* * * * * (b) * * * (4) Validate
the temperature sensor's reading at least semiannually using the
requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this
section: (i) Compare measured readings to a National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable temperature measurement device
or simulate a typical operating temperature using a NIST traceable
temperature simulation device. When the temperature measurement device
method is used, the sensor of the NIST traceable calibrated device must
be placed as close as practicable to the process sensor, and both
devices must be subjected to the same environmental conditions. The
accuracy of the temperature measured must be 2.5 percent of the
temperature measured by the NIST traceable device or 5 [deg]F, whichever
is greater. (ii) Follow applicable procedures in the thermocouple
manufacturer owner's manual. (iii) Request thermocouple manufacturer to
certify or re-certify electromotive force (electrical properties) of the
thermocouple. (iv) Replace thermocouple with a new certified
thermocouple in lieu of validation. (v) Permanently install a redundant
temperature sensor as close as practicable to the process temperature
sensor. The sensors must yield a reading within 30 [deg]F of each other
for thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers; within 5 [deg]F of each
other for biofilters; and within 20 [deg]F of each other for dry rotary
dryers. (5) Conduct validation checks using the procedures in paragraph
(b)(4) of this section any time the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's
specified maximum operating temperature range or install a new
temperature sensor.* * * * *09. Section 63.2270 is amended by revising
paragraph (c) to read as follows:Sec. 63.2270 How do I monitor and
collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?* * * * * (c) You may
not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated
repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities or data
recorded during periods of safety-related shutdown, pressurized refiner
startup or shutdown, startup and shutdown of direct-fired softwood
veneer dryer gas-fired burners, or control device downtime covered in
any approved routine control device maintenance exemption in data
averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels,
nor may such data be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability
requirement, if applicable. You must use all the data collected during
all other periods in assessing the operation of the control
system.* * * * *010. Section 63.2271 is amended by:0a. Revising

submit reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (h),
you must submit reports to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data
Reporting Interface (CEDRI), which can be accessed through the EPA's
Central Data Exchange (CDX) (https://cdx.epa.gov/). The EPA will make
all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public
without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information
you claim as confidential business information (CBI). Anything submitted
using CEDRI cannot later be claimed to be CBI. For semiannual compliance
reports required in this section and Table 9 (row 1) to this subpart,
you must use the appropriate electronic report template on the CEDRI
website
(https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/compliance-and-emissions-data-reporting-interface-cedri)
for this subpart once the reporting template has been available on the
CEDRI website for 1 year. The date report templates become available
will be listed on the CEDRI website. If the reporting form for the
semiannual compliance report specific to this subpart is not available
in CEDRI at the time that the report is due, you must submit the report
to the Administrator at the appropriate addresses listed in Sec. 63.13
You must begin submitting all subsequent reports via CEDRI in the first
full reporting period after the report template for this subpart has
been available in CEDRI for 1 year. Initial Notifications developed
according to Sec. 63.2280(b) and Notifications of Compliance Status
developed according to Sec. 63.2280(d) may be uploaded in a
user-specified format such as portable document format (PDF). The report
must be submitted by the deadline specified in this subpart, regardless
of the method in which the report is submitted. Although we do not
expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if persons wish to assert a CBI
claim, submit a complete report, including information claimed to be
CBI, to the EPA. The report must be generated using the appropriate form
on the CEDRI website. Submit the file on a compact disc, flash drive, or
other commonly used electronic storage medium and clearly mark the
medium as CBI. Mail the electronic medium to U.S EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI
Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02,
4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same file with the CBI omitted
must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX. All CBI claims must be
asserted at the time of submission. Furthermore, under CAA section
114(c) emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment and
requires EPA to make emissions data available to the public. Thus,
emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly
available. (i) Within 60 days after the date of completing each
performance test required by this subpart, you must submit the results
of the performance test following the procedures specified in paragraphs
(i)(1) through (3) of this section. (1) Data collected using test
methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed
on the EPA's ERT website

EPA's ERT website. Submit the ERT generated package or alternative file
to the EPA via CEDRI. (3) Confidential Business Information (CBI). The
EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to
the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit
information you claim as CBI. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot
later be claimed to be CBI. Although we do not expect persons to assert
a claim of CBI, if you claim some of the information submitted under
this paragraph (i) is CBI, you must submit a complete file, including
information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA. The file must be generated
through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file
consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website. Submit

accuracy test audit (RATA) pollutants that are supported by the EPA's
ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the evaluation.
Submit the results of the performance evaluation to the EPA via CEDRI,
which can be accessed through the EPA's CDX. The data must be submitted
in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT.
Alternatively, you may submit an electronic file consistent with the XML
schema listed on the EPA's ERT website. (2) Performance evaluations of
CMS measuring RATA pollutants that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as
listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the evaluation. The
results of the performance evaluation must be included as an attachment
in the ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML
schema listed on the EPA's ERT website. Submit the ERT generated package
or alternative file to the EPA via CEDRI. (3) Confidential Business
Information (CBI). The EPA will make all the information submitted
through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do
not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as CBI. Anything submitted
using CEDRI cannot later be claimed to be CBI. Although we do not expect
persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you claim some of the information
submitted under this paragraph (j) is CBI, you must submit a complete
file, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA. The file must
be generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic
file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website.
Submit the[[Page 49459]]file on a compact disc, flash drive, or other
commonly used electronic storage medium and clearly mark the medium as

submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described in this paragraph
(j). All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission.
Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c) emissions data is not entitled to
confidential treatment and requires EPA to make emissions data available
to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and
will be made publicly available. (k) If you are required to
electronically submit a report or notification through CEDRI in the
EPA's CDX by this subpart, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage
for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal reporting
requirement in this section. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you
must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (k)(1) through (7) of
this section. (1) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing
CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to
an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems. (2) The outage must
have occurred within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior
to the date that the submission is due. (3) The outage may be planned or
unplanned. (4) You must submit notification to the Administrator in
writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or
through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has
caused a delay in reporting. (5) You must provide to the Administrator a
written description identifying: (i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or
CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable; (ii) A rationale for
attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA
system outage; (iii) Measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay
in reporting; and (iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if
you have already met the electronic submittal requirement in this
subpart at the time of the notification, the date you submitted the
report. (6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and
allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the
discretion of the Administrator. (7) In any circumstance, the report
must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is
resolved. (l) If you are required to electronically submit a report
through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX by this subpart, you may assert a claim
of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the electronic
submittal requirement in this section. To assert a claim of force
majeure, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (l)(1)
through (5) of this section. (1) You may submit a claim if a force
majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are
lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning
five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the
purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event
that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of
the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the
affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement
to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed.
Examples of such events are acts of nature (e.g , hurricanes,
earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure
or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (e.g ,
large scale power outage). (2) You must submit notification to the
Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you
first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event
may cause or has caused a delay in reporting. (3) You must provide to
the Administrator: (i) A written description of the force majeure event;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the
regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; (iii) Measures taken or
to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and (iv) The date by
which you propose to report, or if you have already met the electronic
submittal requirement in this subpart at the time of the notification,
the date you submitted the report. (4) The decision to accept the claim
of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is
solely within the discretion of the Administrator. (5) In any
circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the
force majeure event occurs.013. Section 63.2282 is amended by revising
paragraphs (a)(2) and (c)(2) and adding paragraph (f) to read as
follows:Sec. 63.2282 What records must I keep? (a) * * * (2) Before

of ``MSF,'' ``Non-HAP coating,'' and ``Representative operating
conditions'';0b. Adding the definition of ``Safety-related shutdown'' in
alphabetical order; and0c. Removing the definition of ``Startup,
shutdown, and malfunction plan.'' The revisions and addition read as
follows:Sec. 63.2292 What definitions apply to this subpart?* * * * *
MSF means thousand square feet (92.9 square meters). Square footage of
panels is usually measured on a thickness basis, such as \3/8\-inch, to
define the total volume of panels. Equation 3 of Sec. 63.2262(j) shows
how to convert from one thickness basis to another.* * * * * Non-HAP
coating means a coating with HAP contents below 0.1 percent by mass for
Occupational Safety and Health Administration-defined carcinogens as
specified in section A.6.4 of appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1200, and below
1.0 percent by mass for other HAP compounds.* * * * * Representative
operating conditions means operation of a process unit during
performance testing under the conditions that the process unit will
typically be operating in the future, including use of a representative
range of materials (e.g , wood material of a typical species mix and
moisture content or typical resin formulation) and representative
operating temperature range. Representative operating conditions exclude
periods of startup and shutdown.* * * * * Safety-related shutdown means
an unscheduled shutdown of a process unit subject to a compliance option
in Table 1B to this subpart (or a process unit with HAP control under an
emissions averaging plan developed according to Sec. 63.2240(c)) during
which time emissions from the process unit cannot be safely routed to
the control system in place to meet the compliance options or operating
requirements in this subpart without imminent danger to the process,

Guwahati, Feb. 11 -- To a common voter the coming elections are becoming
a very confusing arithmetic. While all this while BJP was claiming it
would get 100+ of the 126 seats in the Assembly, leaving the rest 20 odd
to the Opposition parties, it is now the Congress and its 'Mahajot'
which is claiming 100+ seats, probably leaving the rest 20 odd to the
BJP. The BJP has given its calculation as to how the claimed figure
would be reached. On the contrary, the Congress Plus is silent on how it
would reach its claimed figure. So the common voter is dismissing both
the claims as election rhetoric and getting on to do his own
calculations and waiting for the final outcome after a good dose of
merriment and feasting in the Rongali Bihu. The electoral pundits and
media are also not very sure what would be the final results as yet, the
lone election forecast which predicted a victory for the BJP now well
forgotten.

What is interesting is that the latest Union Budget which come clean on
the entire approach to governance in the coming years by going on a free
enterprise path and ending the behemoth called the public sector, has
been lost in Assam in the midst of this 100 plus calculations of both
the major political groups contesting the elections. In the next four
years, other than the oil companies and the telecommunications sector,
there will be no central public sector undertakings and following from
this it can be expected that the non-profit making State PSUs will also
have to wind up. Not that it will make much of a difference to the
people of Assam, the closure of most State PSUs will mean a loss of jobs
for a few thousand employees and a parking place for non-ministerial
MLAs. But the noise will be much bigger in the media and will give the
Opposition parties of the day a handle to rent the air with agitation
and prove their existence.

The performance of the Sonowal Government has been comparatively good.
It has followed the path shown by the Prime Minister as the then Chief
Minister of Gujarat years ago of improving bijli, sadak, paani,
swasthya, siksha. It has built new bridges and 20,000 km of roads have
been repaired and improved. The education sector has been given a new
impetus with the appointment of new teachers in thousands, building new
schools and colleges and improving the old, waiving school and college
fees, free books, free uniforms, midday meals, book grants for college
students, grants subsidizing mess dues, scooties to girl students,
computers and many more. On the electricity front, the power situation
has improved and more homes have been reached. Drinking water supply has
been a weak point. Corruption has come down and the performance of
government servants have marginally improved. On the health front, the
Atal Amrit Yojana for providing cashless treatment has made a welcome
development and needs to be made universal covering the middle-class.
The best news in the medical front has been in the setting up of new
medical colleges which will double the annual availability of doctors in
the State in another five years. The new cancer hospitals and the
upcoming AIIMS are a much-needed addition. The growth of paramedical and
nursing institutions will have a long-term impact. Granting of pattas to
the indigenous people has been a good step and taken in a mission mode
will help the poor and marginalized. Containing the corona epidemic
would be a feather in the cap of the outgoing Government. It contained
the outbreak medically and ensured the supply lines. Migrants and daily
labour were helped to tide over the darkest of days.

The weak spots of the Government have been in managing the environment
by increasing the green cover to 33% of the landmass and controlling
floods and erosion. Steps taken have been woefully insufficient.

The Union Government has set its economic agenda clearly in the last
budget. India will go on an atmanirbhar path, where the economy will be
driven by individual enterprise aided in infrastructure by the
Government. The public sector will be phased out in non-strategic areas.
It will be less of government and more of governance. So all jobs will
be primarily created in the private sector. This will mean that Assam
too in the coming years has to go for the self-dependent mode with job
creation happening mostly in the private sector. This is something that
the Assamese mind has to adjust to. However difficult it may not be, it
will be a harsh reality which the Government has to cope with and
inculcate a cultural change in the mindset of the locals. How to ignite
the entrepreneurial spirit in the youth will be a big challenge, as
there are no teachers and very few self-made success stories to emulate.

Again the country has pegged its annual growth rate to 11%, which in
Assam's case has to be in the region of 20% if it has to keep pace with
the developed States and 25% if it has to come up from its 28th position
in per capita income, among the States. This has to be done in organic
and variety products in tea, organic farming, horticulture and tourism.
None of these sectors are in robust health today nor are they
widespread. Newer avenues have to be also added to the thrust areas. All
this will call for a detailed plan to coordinate individual enterprise
with government infrastructure support. Assistance will have to be
provided in marketing and finance also. Startups will have more failures
than success in the initial days. How will the Government assist in
cushioning the failures and put the entrepreneurs back on track will
mean the placing of a mechanism to deal with the pitfalls. With the
cushion effect, the first generation entrepreneurs will back out from
repeated attempts, thereby killing dreams before they are made into a
reality. Assam does not have enough of quality mentors to create a
climate of entrepreneurship. Hence, the State Government will have to
reach out to other States and corporates for support.

Opening up the national and international markets for products of the
State or even gaining a foothold will be a Herculean task, much beyond
the capacity of the local bureaucracy. How the Government proposes to
deal with the issue will require advance and creative planning.

In the organic farming sector, for prices to be remunerative, the
selling has to be done mostly in the export market. This will call for
adherence to international food safety requirements, quality packing and
transport, cold chain support, timely supply of inputs, easy access to
finance, ease of doing business, regularity in international cargo
flights, keeping to delivery schedule, etc. The Assamese farmer has to
be inculcated with the business sense and expertise to meet the demands
of the international market. Unfortunately, there are no such
institutions to train the farmers of Assam in national and international
marketing. The role of intermediaries has to be kept to the minimum. The
whole production, storage, packaging and selling process has to be tuned
into a seamless flow, to fructify the Prime Minister's dream of an
Organic Northeast. Sikkim has taken a lead. It's now to be seen how
Assam comes to the forefront and how the government makes it a policy in
the party's manifesto for the coming assembly elections.

Will the Assam Mala have a plan for bridges across the Brahmaputra at
every 60 km gap or a second Trunk Road on both the banks of the mighty
river connecting the bridges will have to be seen in future.

YourStory UNCUT: upGrad's Phalgun Kompalli on the ups and downs of
building an edtech unicorn

YourStory UNCUT aims to explore the biggest challenges and failures
startups and entrepreneurs have faced in their journeys. This week,
Phalgun Kompalli of upGrad talks about the roadblocks he encountered.

"Even today, when we pitch to 10 investors, we hear a 'No' from eight,"
Phalgun Kompalli, Co-founder of edtech unicorn upGrad, tells YourStory.
Founded in 2015 by founder of the UTV Group and RSVP Movies Ronnie
Screwvala, Mayank Kumar, and Phalgun, upGrad aimed to cater to the
growing needs of upskilling in the market. Believed to be South Asia's
largest online higher edtech company, it currently offers more than 100
courses with tie-ups with top-notch universities. The startup has
impacted over one million learners across 50-plus countries. In August
2021, Mumbai-based upGrad entered the unicorn club after raising $185
million from Temasek, IFC and Indian Infoline Finance. However, all this
success was not achieved overnight and the founders continue to struggle
with roadblocks that the entrepreneurial journey presents. Get connected
to upGrad "There will always be challenges It is not like you will only
have challenges if you are an angel-funded company, or a Series A
company or a unicorn Even if you are a Tesla or an Amazon, you will have
the same number of challenges," Phalgun says. For the latest episode in
YourStory UNCUT, Phalgun shares the challenges that he, and upGrad at
large, faced while building the edtech unicorn. "> ">

Hiring and retention

"The number one challenge at every point in the last seven years, and
even more right now, is hiring great talent," reveals Phalgun.

Even with enough capital at its disposal and established brand equity in
the market, upGrad struggles with hiring the right talent across its
teams. "It is still such a competitive market for hiring talent. The
challenge of getting hold of the best talent and getting them to do
their best work is always there," he says.

In the early days of COVID-19, the edtech startup faced a major
challenge with respect to keeping the entire team engaged. "Given
work-from-home and the difficulties we were facing overall as a group,
we saw some level of attrition."

At present, upGrad is proactively working towards decreasing attrition.
To do so, Phalgun reveals that the startup is offering competitive pay,
working on its culture to make employees feel entrepreneurial and
empowered, and hiring from within the personal network of the existing
team.

"People do not mind being told no. What they do mind is being
disengaged," he says. Keeping this in mind, upGrad has been working
towards employee engagement.

"We try spreading positivity among our employees by sharing the success
stories This makes employees believe that what they are doing is
meaningful and that they are helping make people's lives better."

Innovation and growth

Another challenge upGrad faces is in innovating to grow. With startups
going through various inflexion points, one gets stuck at one point for
months. Post which, figuring out the next innovation to jump to the next
point is challenging.

"It all depends on the team, and how fast a startup can innovate and
execute We constantly face these inflexion points," Phalgun adds.

With the infusion of the last round of funding, upGrad now has a team in
Singapore, the UK, and the US, and is currently figuring out how to go
about these international markets. "Currently we are at a dis-inflexion
point where we are trying to figure out what initiatives we pick and
where we need to focus on for the next 20-24 months."

Major milestones

While getting labelled as a unicorn is a key milestone, Phalgun never
mentions it as a highlight of upGrad's journey. Instead, he listed the
following as the major five milestones in the history of the edtech
startup.

Getting the first learner onboarded seven years back

Partnering with the first university - IIIT Bangalore, and having it as
the largest university partner today

Onboarding the first international university partner - John Moores
University, which is now the second-largest university partner for
upGrad

Hiring the first employee and growing the team to 4,000 employees today

Raising investments

On raising funds

One may think raising funds for a startup founded by an eminent
entrepreneur must be a cakewalk. However, that is not the case, suggests
Phalgun.

"Having a seasoned entrepreneur is extremely valuable in terms of
mistakes that we could have otherwise made and setting the pace and
making the right decisionsthat guidance and experience are definitely
helpful," he says.

That being said, upGrad does not have a playbook for raising
investments.

"I am used to hearing no 50 times a weekfrom investors, employees, team,
university partners, and learners," he adds, and that he has gotten used
to getting rejections.

Phalgun suggests that with the right amount of persistence,
entrepreneurs will be able to find investors who understand the value
that they bring to the table, understand the mission, and support them
in their journey.

"When you are trying to push boundaries and be creative, there will be
roadblocks. But do not take it personally when someone says no. It is an
opportunity to either understand and learn where they are coming from or
to change somebody's mind and accept that it will not happen overnight,"
he says. Phalgun recalls that a university partner that upGrad had
approached eight years ago, was only convinced recently, and signed the
partnership with the startup.

"Talk to someone who has said no to you. If not money, get constructive
feedback from investors who reject you and see how you can improve,"
Phalgun advises.

Expert says

Towards the end of the conversation, Phalgun shares a few suggestions
for aspiring and early-stage entrepreneurs. He says:

"Hire your first employees very carefully, it is a make-it or break-it
situation for any companyIt will eventually decide if your company grows
into a $1 million or $100 million business."

"Post the initial phase, you need to realise the value that domain
expertise brings to the tableYou cannot assume that a general, smart and
dedicated person will figure out everything."

"Entrepreneurship is not a straight line with a 20-degree slope, it is a
sinusoidal curve. So, build emotional and mental resilience."

When asked one thing that he would like to change about his journey as
an entrepreneur, Phalgun ends with, "I would not let various situations
affect me as much as I have allowed them to. When something did not go
the way I wanted, I would sulk for a long time. What I would do
differently is have a little more resilience and take a longer view of
life."

TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS HOST: That`s it for tonight`s "Inside the Issue"
special. Tune in each night at 8:00 to the show, that is the sworn enemy
of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink, Tucker will be back from
his vacation on Monday. But you can also check out my Fox Nation --

GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS HOST: And welcome to this special edition of
"Hannity": Issues Facing America. I`m Gregg Jarrett, in tonight for
Sean.

Jeffrey Epstein`s autopsy has been released to some extent. The
convicted pedophile`s death was officially ruled a suicide. But
according to reports, Epstein was in great spirits just hours before the
suicide and was confident about his ongoing criminal case.

Coming up, forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht will be here with a full
analysis. But first, joining us with more is Trace Gallagher -- Trace.

TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Gregg, breaking tonight,
three of Jeffrey Epstein`s lawyers are challenging the autopsy report
and planning their own investigation into the cause of death. The
lawyers also blame the Metropolitan Correctional Center for the medieval
conditions and for not protecting Epstein by violating numerous
protocols.

Meantime, the autopsy results themselves are vague. Normally, we get the
diagrams, descriptions and the definitions to help decipher the
findings. But so far, all the medical examiner is saying is that Jeffrey
Epstein died by suicide and the cause was hanging. The "Daily Beast" is
reporting that the marks on Epstein`s neck looks like those from fabric,
which squares with the information that Epstein tied a bed sheet around
his neck and secured it to the top bunk.

There are reports that Epstein was found kneeling forward as if lunging
forward. But several medical examiners say lunging as a rule is not
enough force to break the hyoid bone. And they add that just because he
was found on his knees doesn`t necessarily mean he didn`t throw himself
off the top bunk.

And adding another twist to an already dizzying canvas, Fox News can
confirm that some MCC personnel, including prison staff, are not
cooperating with the investigations in to Epstein`s death. But with
Congress and the DOJ both conducting separate inquiries, the belief is
that many will be compelled to cooperate -- Gregg.

JARRETT: I would imagine. Trace, thanks very much.

Tonight, we know Epstein`s autopsy concluded that he hung himself
reportedly with a bed sheet. But according to my next guest, there could
be more to the story.

Joining us now to talk about it, forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht.

Dr. Wecht, great to see you.

DR. CYRIL WECHT, FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST: Good evening.

JARRETT: There`s been a great deal of talk that Epstein suffered a hyoid
fracture right around the Adam`s apple area. But I want to caution our
viewers, that`s only from sources to the "Washington Post," which broke
that story. We haven`t heard that from the medical examiner herself. So
that, I mean, it would be important to know A, that`s confirmed. And, B,
what, I would imagine the nature of that fracture.

WECHT: Yes. It`s my understanding that no details have been released. We
are just simply told what the medical examiner`s conclusions were.
Vis-a- vis, cause of death, hanging, manner of death, suicide. I would
need to see all of the details.

Let me say this. That if this is a leaning into kind of a hanging, not
someone hurling himself from the top bunk, but if he were, for example,
maybe sitting on the lower bunk, or kneeling by there, and no evidence
of his having been on the top bunk and hurling himself off, then there
is no velocity, there is no force imparted to that scenario.

Leaning forward, in my opinion, would not lead to what we are told are,
quote, multiple fractures, unquote. We don`t know what was broken
exactly. No details have come from the medical examiner`s office. We are
told by the "Washington Post," "The New York Post", that the hyoid bone
was broken. That`s above the Adam`s apple by a couple of inches in a
good size man.

And then the other fractures, if they are fractures of the thyroid
cartridge, the Adam`s apple, in association with a fracture of the hyoid
bone that is highly suspicious, and in my opinion, extremely unlikely to
have been caused by leaning into suicidal hanging.

JARRETT: But, Doctor, just to be clear, if he is on the top bunk with
bed sheet around his neck and propels himself off the top bunk, the
hyoid fracture and maybe another fracture or two, that would be
consistent with that behavior?

WECHT: Yes. If he were on the top bunk and he hurled himself, he jumped
off, that is I understand five and a half feet high. And you`ve got his
increased height from waist to head. So, you`ve got seven feet or so
roughly.

That drop could lead to those kind of fractures. So, I agree. And I want
to make that clear, I cannot express an opinion with reasonable medical
certainty. I can only repeat what I have said based upon the cases I
have myself examined.

Hundreds of cases over the years in my 20,000-plus autopsies, 40,000
other cases that I have reviewed, supervised or signed off on, that I
have not seen multiple fractures in a simple leaning into kind of
suicidal hanging where there is no velocity. Velocity is what gives you
force.

JARRETT: Right.

WECHT: And if you don`t have velocity, you don`t have force. That is
what this case is all about. They should have done, maybe they have, an
investigation of the cell. First of all, why was there a double bunk
cell? And then taking out the cell mate the day before.

If you have someone on suicide watch and he still should have been on
suicide watch, don`t you think, gee, maybe he might jump from the higher
balcony? Why are there two bunks like that?

There are a lot of things have to be correlated with the anatomic
findings. What was the position of the body? Was he kneeling as if he
had just leaned forward? If you hurl yourself off, I heard you say,
quoting somebody else, well, me might land like that on your knees. Yes,
you can do that. You can do it with people, you don`t have to tie their
necks or so on.

But guys that do stunt and so on, give them knee padding and let them
jump off and see how they land. It`s highly doubtful they`re going to
land in kind of a bent over, kneeling position from the waist. It`s
highly unlikely hurling yourself --

JARRETT: Sure, and you would want --

WECHT: -- from five and a half feet high

JARRETT: You want to look for abrasions on the knee and the other
evidence of trauma to the body.

Dr. Cyril Wecht, many thanks for being with us.

WECHT: Yes, very good.

JARRETT: Good to see you.

WECHT: Thank you.

JARRETT: Without a doubt, irregularity surrounding Epstein`s death are
downright shocking. Today, Fox News learned that Attorney General
William Barr has dispatched two senior Department of Justice officials
to the Metropolitan Corrections Center to gather additional information.
Those officials have been there, actually, since Thursday.

Joining us now with a full report is Catherine Herridge -- Catherine.

CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Gregg, and good
evening.

We could get a reading next week of the Justice Department`s preliminary
findings into the Epstein case. They are investigating how the Bureau of
Prison staffing and overtime may have contributed to the events
surrounding his death. The Attorney General William Barr, as you
mentioned, dispatching two of his top aids to independently gather
information and speak directly with Bureau of Prison staff at the MCC
where Epstein was being held. The team has been on site since Thursday.

Separately, the Department of Justice has an after action review team,
working through the Bureau of Prisons which falls under Justice
Department authority. That team is still on scene at MCC, preparing a
high level debrief, analyzing what went wrong. We are nearly a week out
from Epstein`s death and the key issues remain staffing, who was working
overtime shifts and whether the protocols monitoring Epstein were
followed after he came off the suicide watch as well as the removal of
the cell mate.

FOX News can report tonight that officials have found 94 percent of the
overtime hours during that critical period were done voluntarily and
also this evening, new information from the producer Bill Mears that
there are indications that there was a lack of cooperation among some of
the MCC staffers, Gregg.

JARRETT: Catherine Herridge in Washington -- Catherine, thanks very
much.

HERRIDGE: You`re welcome.

JARRETT: Joining us now is Fox News contributor and retired LAPD
detective Mark Fuhrman, former FBI special agent Manny Gomez, and Fox
News contributor Emily Compagno.

Good to have you all.

Mark, let me begin with you. It strikes me that a critical component of
this are the videotape of the cameras that would have been in the
hallway and general area. And you would want to examine the three-hour
period of time in which he allegedly killed himself to determine if
anyone had access or egress to his jail cell, right?

MARK FUHRMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. And the interesting part
about the pathology report is that we don`t have the summary or the
protocols. But we have the cause and the manner of death, as Dr. Wecht
stated. And this gives you a finding combined with the detectives` view
of the crime scene.

One of those is the surveillance video that during the estimated time of
death, before and after, nobody entered the cell. Nobody approached the
door. Nobody exited. So that eliminates the death at the hands of
another. And thousand we have to conclude with the evidence that it is
suicide.

JARRETT: Emily, the defense lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein are hinting they
don`t buy it. They want to conduct their own investigation, maybe
another autopsy. It`s a little bit unclear.

I suspect they are driven by guilty more than anything else. It was the
defense attorney who was urging the Metropolitan Corrections Center to
take him off suicide watch. But for that request Epstein might still be
alive today.

EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: There`s certainly a measure of
responsibility at minimum and culpability at a maximum that those
attorneys hold. Yes. I want to point out for viewers as well, though,
that the fact that the autopsy ruled this a suicide means that Epstein`s
estate can sue for what is essentially wrongful death at the hands of
the state.

And what is interesting to note is that the standard of review for those
kind of the cases, when the inmates commit suicide and the family of the
loved ones saying, hey, it was your fault, state. You broke in the
protocol or there was negligence that led to the suicide that you knew
could have happened, the standard is deliberate indifference. It`s a
very tough bar to cross. And of all the cases I reviewed, the vast
majority were moved out of court at the summary judgment stage, which
meant that the defendant simply even falling asleep, it still didn`t
qualify.

JARRETT: You know, Manny, there is a report and this may also be fed by
the defense attorneys who harbor guilt of their own by virtue of their
actions, that well, he was upbeat. He was optimistic about his chances
on a double jeopardy motion that had been filed. Frankly, I always as a
defense attorney discount the mindset of a client.

MANNY GOMEZ, FORMER NYPD SERGEANT: Absolutely. The mindset of this
individual before he perhaps committed suicide, apparently committed
suicide, has no to do with the negligence, the recklessness of how MCC
behaved in this matter. In fact, they are acting as psychologist which
has nothing to do with the case at hand, which is how is the most highly
visible inmate in the United States capable of committing suicide when
they went against every protocol that they, themselves have in place to
prevent that?

JARRETT: Mark, if it`s not suicide, but rather a homicide, that would
require some fairly insurmountable challenges to carry out, wouldn`t it?

FUHRMAN: Well, it would. Dr. Wecht pointed out both sides of the coin in
the medical evidence. But there was no filmed or witnessed inside the
cell. So, we don`t know if he jumped from the top of the bunk or he
merely leaned over in a forceful way. We don`t know that.

So, to change a suicide to a homicide in this respect, you are going to
have to have a witness or you`re going to have to have a film of the act
or a participant in the act to come forward.

So, we know nobody entered the cell. So, he did not die at the hands of
another. We certainly don`t know the toxicology yet. But if they are
going to rule it a suicide, I would say that there is no drugs in his
suicide that would make him compliant or unconscious so somebody could
stage the scene. So, that is a huge bar to change it from a suicide or
implicate it was a homicide.

JARRETT: All right. So, where does the case go now? It`s possible co-
conspirators could be charged. In particular, Ghislaine Maxwell has been
identified as the madam who arranged the sex trafficking allegedly. She
was MIA until somebody spotted her at an In-N-Out Burger in Southern
California. There`s a cover of "The New York Post".

Well, she certainly knows where to find a good burger. The question is
does she know where to find a good criminal defense lawyer? Because I
suspect she`s going to need one, Emily.

COMPAGNO: Right. So, as of yet, she has been unindicted, unnamed. But
that said, there`s unnamed co-conspirators in those original charging
documents. And certainly, she has a lot to answer for.

She`s accused of being not only a co-conspirator in terms of the
orchestration of this vast network but also an abuser herself. She is
also right now the defendant of civil lawsuits in state of New York in
terms of -- as well as the defendant estate of Epstein. Note for the
viewers to keep track of this all there is also an FBI and a DOJ
investigation in to this correctional institution.

There are many threads. But bottom line as well with Maxwell, with
Ghislaine Maxwell, is that if she proves a useful source of information,
then it would behoove her to --

JARRETT: To flip.

COMPAGNO: -- be as transparent as possible to the government. Yes. She
would have to be charged first with something because of now, we don`t
know.

JARRETT: We need leverage.

COMPAGNO: Uh-huh.

JARRETT: Manny, there was back in the original case in 2007 in which was
there a plea deal to two charges, a non-prosecution immunity agreement
that apparently affects others. I suspect that is not worth the paper
it`s written on for a couple of reasons. First, it doesn`t immunize you
for future acts so acts after 2007 are not covered. Second of all, it
appears that it violated the Crime Victims Rights Act in which the
victims were never notified.

GOMEZ: You`re absolutely right. And he had this hubris that he thought
he was falling under double jeopardy and he would not be prosecuted for
-- not prosecuted, but be found guilty or this. And it would be thrown
out of court.

Clearly, that was not the case. He obviously was desperate and
apparently committed suicide. That being said, it still does not excuse
actions of MCC Bureau Prisons, et cetera, and it certainly doesn`t
excuse the action of coconspirators as William Barr said. They will
still continue to be investigators and prosecuted if needed.

JARRETT: Oh, yes, you can tell that Barr is angry.

GOMEZ: Absolutely.

JARRETT: He`s going to get to the bottom of what happened here.

GOMEZ: Absolutely.

JARRETT: Mark, I want you to have the final word here. As the case moves
forward, there have been identified at least half a dozen women who are
allegedly aiding and abetting according to some of the victims. Is that
where the case goes now?

FUHRMAN: I think it where it has to go. They don`t have Epstein now, so
they`re going to go with all the people they might have been able to
flip, and have them testify against Epstein. Now, they`re going to have
to pursue some of the most important ones and have the minor ones
testify against him to prove the case.

But most of the crimes, if it wasn`t filmed or witnessed and you don`t
have a victim, then you have sex trafficking but you really don`t have a
strong case. They need someone on the inside.

JARRETT: Yes, they need someone on the inside. Of course, they need the
alleged accusers to come forward and say this happened to me, it was
sexual assault, which is a horrendous, violent crime.

Mark, Manny, Emily, thank you for being with us.

Coming up next, big breaking news our investigation into the
investigators. Plus, we will recap Joe Biden`s bad week. Stay with us as
this special edition of "Hannity" continues.

JARRETT: Welcome back to this "Hannity" special: Issues Facing America.

Big developments tonight in our quest to hold those who abuse power
accountable, and to expose the deep state`s effort to undermine a duly
elected president. And it all starts with the rigged investigation into
Hillary Clinton where we learned this week that FBI officials, quote,
seemed indifferent to a possible hack by China of Hillary Clinton`s
server, exposing the deep double standards inside the highest level of
our government.

And get this -- according to a new Senate report, the same Clinton I.T.
aide who defied a subpoena apparently admitted to the FBI that he
created a cryptic Gmail account as a way to copy all of Hillary
Clinton`s e-mails, including classified documents. That`s right, on a
Google server, for everybody to hack. More on this just ahead.

Plus, we have some of the most convincing evidence yet of the
information laundering scheme inside the Department of Justice involving
Bruce and Nellie Ohr because new documents obtained by Judicial Watch
show that Nellie Ohr, a former contractor for Fusion GPS, remember,
being commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign was funneling
anti-Trump materials through her husband, a top official, at the
Department of Justice who had several secret meetings with dossier
author Christopher Steele.

And in some cases, Nellie Ohr didn`t need her husband to disseminate her
seedy op research because other newly discovered documents show that
Nellie Ohr was communicating with other top DOJ officials while she`s
working with Fusion GPS. It`s really unbelievable.

Now, of course, this is all just one way that intelligence was
weaponized against Team Trump. Don`t forget about the use of spies. Like
this guy, alleged FBI in informant Stefan Halper -- I`m going to erase
the term "alleged" because it`s pretty damn clear -- who is now claiming
immunity affords him coverage in a defamation lawsuit against him,
raising even more questions about the mysterious former Cambridge
professor.

Joining me for reaction to all of this is the former Acting Attorney
General Matt Whitaker.

Matt, thanks for being with us.

Let`s start with Bruce and Nellie Ohr. Nellie Ohr told Congress the only
person she gave the anti-Trump information to was her husband. Now, it
turns out that at least three prosecutors were given the information by
Nellie Ohr. There are 339 pages of e-mails showing it. That looks like
lying to Congress, which is the last time I check and we can all check
with Michael Cohen, that is a crime, isn`t it?

MATT WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: It is a
crime. And the entire situation surrounding Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr was
concerning to me when I was at the Department of Justice. This is a key
thing that Mr. Durham is looking at, and the whole -- how did this
investigation start. I know that Mr. Huber, U.S. attorney from Utah, is
looking at the FISA abuse. I know the inspector general is looking at
it.

I hope that we can get full transparency and all the answers to the
questions, Gregg, because I know that you and others have been asking
the questions and really receiving unsatisfactory answers. There was no
doubt that Fusion GPS was trying to get the false dossier and the
information it contained to anyone who could launch an investigation or
otherwise throw a wrench in the campaign in 2016. We have to make sure
it never happens again.

JARRETT: How is it possible that Bruce Ohr is still employed at the
Department of Justice? I mean, this guy is required under federal
regulation to disclose financial benefits he was receiving. His wife is
paid by fusion through Hillary Clinton`s campaign. It`s going to the
Bruce and Nellie Ohr joint bank account. He didn`t disclose it. Nor did
he seek recusal in the case. Isn`t that a firing offense?

WHITAKER: Yes, their financial disclosure is very important as to the
sources of your income and that is something that each federal employee
fills out every year to look at conflicts of interest. And I think the
process for employment for career officials, there is, it`s a long
process in order to terminate someone.

There has to be enough evidence and a record. So, the investigations by
both the inspector general and the two attorneys I mentioned could be
the basis for that. That is what happened in McCabe`s situation, where
the inspector general decision drove the decision to terminate him. And
I think in this case, once those reports come out, it could be basis for
employment investigation.

JARRETT: All right. Matt Whitaker, thank you for being with me.

WHITAKER: Thank you, Gregg.

JARRETT: Joining me now for more reaction to all of this, former U.S.
attorney Brett Tolman and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz.

I mean, there is already a criminal referral against Nellie Ohr and
probably should be one against Bruce Ohr, but we`ll wait to see.

I want to tackle another suggest with you, Congressman Gaetz. We now
learned you can read about in "The Daily Caller" that according to a
Senate report, every single Hillary Clinton e-mail was sent secretly to
a cryptic Gmail address, including classified documents. So, you`ve got
potentially hundreds if not thousands of documents that are sensitive,
if not classified, that can easily be hacked on a Google server.

And an intelligent agent discovered it, notified Peter Strzok who was
disinterested and dismissive. Congressman, how can that be?

REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): The reason this is the case is because they all
thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. Remember, Gregg, the Trump
Russia allegations weren`t the crime. They were the cover-up, because a
lot of the folks at the FBI and the Department of Justice thought they
would be retaliated against by a future President Hillary Clinton if
they aggressively pursued the facts and applied the law when it related
to her unlawful conduct with e-mails and a sensitive and classified
information.

So, the reason we`re getting this drip by drip is you because you have
people, the FBI and the Department of Justice, who were paving a yellow
brick road to exoneration for Hillary Clinton when they should have been
doing their job. That is because James Comey curated an environment at
the FBI where they weren`t really doing investigations, they were trying
to shape public opinion. And when you see the bias that was so evident
in the case of the people investigating Hillary Clinton, there is no
excuse for the outcome that she wasn`t forced to account for the bad
conduct.

JARRETT: You know, if you got classified documents on a Google server,
Fred, I mean everybody has got it, including the Russians. And we now
also know that the Chinese apparently hacked Hillary Clinton`s
classified documents. And once again, the FBI is notified of this, and
they didn`t care.

Isn`t that just the quintessential malfeasance of the FBI?

BRETT TOLMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, I know a hundred agents and
executives of the FBI that would have reacted differently than Peter
Strzok did, and would have placed this at the top of their priority
list. The bottom line on classified information, think about this, Gregg
-- taking any classified information and mishandling it to summarize
what our laws state, mishandling of classified information is a crime in
this country. You know perhaps the only one that`s a bit relieved
tonight is Hillary Clinton, because the story doesn`t seem to come back
to focus on the fact that she has a private server. And these emails are
on a private server.

And those emails end up going to more public place by her instruction,
you have to believe, it`s by her instruction. She hired the company and
they put it on that to that public place for anyone to potentially see
it and let`s face it, right now and back then China is absolutely one of
our top threats to this country`s National Security.

JARRETT: Paul Kimbata (ph) is the IT guy worked for Hillary Clinton and
unbelievably Congressman, he got immunity from the FBI in exchange for
nothing which in my almost 40 years as a lawyer, I`ve never heard of
that, never seen that before, he gets immunity from prosecution. And
now, he is refusing to even cooperate or talk to the DOJ Inspector
General.

REP. MARK GAETZ (R-FL): Well, when we in the Congress saw the immunity
deals that were given not only in this instance but to a variety of
other Hillary Clinton Associates, you wonder what was really bargained
for, an immunity deal is in exchange for evidence that leads to a more
high-profile or high priority target that the government has in a
particular case.

But you saw blanket immunity deals given to people that didn`t create
more of an incentive for them to give information, it created less of an
incentive as you`re seeing right now and I think that it was really
drawn into critique by the Inspector General when he analyzed the bias
that existed here and really the extent to which that bias could have
impacted the outcome in the case.

JARRETT: And Brett, I`ll let you have the last word, I`ve only got about
30 seconds left. But this is crooked as the days long, isn`t it?

TOLMAN: Well, it is. In 20 years of practicing Federal Criminal Law. I
was never able to get blanket immunity, not for a cooperator that I
wanted DOJ to give immunity, not for when I became a defense attorney,
not for any of my clients. They`ve got limited immunity and they always
had to give something up that was substantial. What we have here is
failure that started to percolate up at multiple levels and it`s just
the beginning.

JARRETT: Yes. Well, this was James Comey`s FBI, the sanctomy is
vainglorious. Former FBI Director. Gentlemen, thank you very much for
being with us, Congressman Gaetz, Brett Tolman. Thank you so much.

GAETZ: Thank you.

JARRETT: Coming up next, you can run but you can`t hide. The Biden
campaign is allegedly considering scaling back his campaign in order to
avoid putting his foot in his mouth. Stay with us as this special
edition of Hannity continue. Don`t go away.

JARRETT: Welcome back to the Hannity Special. President Trump at his
rally in New Hampshire last night calling out Joe Biden`s campaign over
talks that they might dial back his appearances because of the former
VP`s incessant gaffes. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: But I don`t know, I
think Sleepy Joe maybe able to limp across the finish line. But today,
they announced that they`re going to cut way back on his appearance
because he`s such a disaster, they`re going to have fewer appearances,
you`ve heard that, right. This is sure, they`re going to cut way back on
his appearances, can you believe it?

If I even did that, it would be over.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

JARRETT: That`s not all. The New York Times is reporting today that in a
private conversation earlier this year, Obama even discouraged Biden
from running. The report says, Obama told Biden "you don`t have to do
this, Joe, you really don`t." But that`s not all, the report goes on to
say that Obama told Biden`s adviser back in March that they can`t let
Biden "embarrass himself" or "damage his legacy."

Joining us now for reactions, CEO of The New Voice, Herman Cain. Mr.
Cain always good to talk to you. Is hiding from voters a sound campaign
strategy?

HERMAN CAIN, THE NEW VOICE CEO: No. As you said earlier, you can run but
you can`t hide. You are not going to win an election by the people not
being able to hear and see you. So, it might be a good strategy to avoid
some future gaffes by Joe Biden, but it`s not a good strategy in order
to endear voters to vote for you.

So, no, that is not a good strategy.

JARRETT: Well, I mean there is no getting around the fact that Joe Biden
has a reputation of being a gaffe machine.

CAIN: Right.

JARRETT: Which may account for why he was inveterate plagiarist until he
got caught of course and it`s tempting to say, this is a guy who is not
up for the intellectual challenge of either a campaign or the
presidency. What do you think?

CAIN: I happen to agree with you. And if he makes it to the nomination,
he will embarrass himself and he will embarrass the Democrat Party.
Let`s face it, he is not sharp enough to be in this race.

The only reason Joe Biden is leading in the polls amongst the Democratic
presidential wannabes is because he`s the lesser of all of the Socialist
evils. That`s why.

Most normal Democrats if there are such a thing as normal Democrats,
they would rather go with somebody like Joe who is more normal that`s
going to lead us back to where we were that one of those socialist
that`s out there. Every one of the other candidates, every one of them
have basically proposed socialist ideas.

So, that`s why he is still leading in the polls. So, they think that if
they keep him out of sight, he`s going to continue to leave in the
folds.

JARRETT: Yes, well I`ve got news for him, he`s not doing so well these
days in Iowa, not of course who is the first contest and if Elizabeth
Warren wins there as one poll indicates. That`s finito for Joe Biden.
Herman Cain, thank you.

CAIN: Right.

JARRETT: So much for being with us. Good to see you.

CAIN: Thanks, Gregg.

JARRETT: Joining us now with more reaction is the author of the book,
Still Winning, Fox News Contributor Charlie Hurt. Also, with us is
former Clinton Pollster, Fox News Contributor Doug Schoen. Good to see
you both.

DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you.

JARRETT: When the former President of the United States Barack Obama
says, you don`t need to do this.

SCHOEN: Right.

JARRETT: Joe. Is that a polite way of saying don`t do this Joe.

SCHOEN: Yes, I think so. And to Herman Cain`s point, I think of myself
as a normal Democrat, an ideologically I am aligned with Joe Biden, but
seeing gaffe after gaffe after gaffe, it`s becoming clear to me from the
polls you`ve mentioned in Iowa polls and New Hampshire and the national
numbers that Joe Biden is on a skid that I`m not sure he can recover
from.

JARRETT: But it`s not something new, is it Charlie. I mean Joe Biden has
been putting both feet in his mouth for decades, right?

CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, this has been his stick for 45
years in Washington, and it`s why he`s never managed to get the
nomination for President. And it`s why the closest he`s ever come to the
White House was being handpicked by Barack Obama to be his Vice
President.

And think about this for a minute though. Think about how embarrassed
Barack Obama must be to have this guy trying to go out there and uphold
Obama`s legacy. It`s got to be hugely embarrassing.

But think about the other thing, which is who leaked all of this stuff,
who leaked these conversations to The New York Times. It wasn`t Biden`s
campaign. This is hugely embarrassing to Biden`s campaign.

The only people that could have leaked all this stuff to The New York
Times is Barack Obama`s people.

JARRETT: Right.

HURT: And I mean what--

JARRETT: I agree.

HURT: In the back.

JARRETT: I agree. It is a shove in the back, and it had to come from
Obama`s people, because they`re watching for example. Doug, the debates
and fellow Democrats are attacking Biden over Obama legacy programs like
the deportation of illegal immigrants and Obamacare.

SCHOEN: Right. And Biden has had trouble defending those policies,
articulating his own policies, but what`s been really a problem is, he`s
been saddled with support for the 94 crime Bill. He hadn`t been able to
defend himself which also included an assault weapon ban.

And the fact that he has been linked to segregationist in the first
debate and it still hasn`t really incredibly answered that. This is a
campaign in crisis and indeed I`d say some degree of disarray.

JARRETT: And I mentioned a moment ago, Charlie, you look at one of the
most recent Iowa polls, and OK, it was an online poll. It may be an
outlier, but it does show a trend with the other polls and that is Biden
is going down in Iowa, Warren is going up. If Biden can`t win Iowa, it`s
bust (ph), isn`t it?

HURT: Yes. No, it`s a real problem for him. And of course, I think that
the rest of the field of Democrats running all - as Doug just pointed
out. All these Democrats that are running, they`ve gone plum crazy, plum
full socialism. And I don`t think that`s where the regular mainstream
Democratic voters are and so my question then is, OK, well then, where
is Barack Obama. He`s the most popular Democrat in the land.

If he is the leader of the party, why hasn`t he step out, he steps into
this and mediate some of this because his legacy is going to down the
toilet with any of these socialists that get picked and Barack Obama is
just standing on the sidelines. It`s pathetic leadership.

JARRETT: Why doesn`t Obama jump in.

SCHOEN: Because the strongest candidate that Barack Obama knows well is
named Michelle Obama and she`s made it clear; she`s not going to run.
And you know what, this is an insoluble problem, Greg, because the
Democrats have moved so far left, people like could not vote for
socialist, for President, I`m a capitalist.

JARRETT: Yes. All right. Dough Schoen and Charlie Hurt, good to see you
both. Have a great weekend.

SCHOEN: Thank you.

JARRETT: Coming up, Dem, radical Dems are ratcheting up their rhetoric,
Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris are spreading dangerous falsehoods. I
call them lies and the media is afraid to call them out on it. We`ll
explain. Stay with us.

JARRETT: Welcome back to this Hannity`s Special. Issues facing America
is the more than 20 Democratic Presidential contenders fight for the
nomination. Many are competing to see how Far-Left they can go or how
crazy they can be.

Yesterday, during a campaign event, Beto O`Rourke made this monist (ph)
prediction about President Trump. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BETO O`ROURKE (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When we allow this country to
be defined along the lines of race and ethnicity, and religion. We allow
a Commander-in-Chief to not only welcome that but the violence that
follows to defy our laws, our institutions and any ethical or moral
boundaries that if at this moment, we do not wake up to this threat then
we as a country will die in our sleep.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

JARRETT: We will die in our sleep. Also, this week, Senator Elizabeth
Warren defended her claim that Michael Brown was "murdered" by white
police officer in Ferguson, the liberal fact-checking website,
PolitiFact failed to call out Warren and fellow candidate Kamala Harris
for calling the shooting murder even though the officer was never
indicted.

And in fact, Obama`s DOJ declared that the officer "did not act with a
requisite criminal intent to be charged with a federal offense."

Joining us now with reaction, Sirius XM Radio Host, Fox News
Contributor, David Webb, and the Hill Media Reporter Joe Concha. Good to
see you guys.

So, David, we`re going to die in our sleep, when a candidate says
something really profoundly stupid, one can reasonably conclude that the
speaker is stupid. Has he forfeited his right to be taken seriously as a
candidate?

DAVID WEBB, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He forfeited that a long time ago.
When you look at the things he said on the campaign trail, off the
campaign trail, this is I believe the fourth, maybe fifth restart of his
campaign in some form, it`s fail and he has fallen to the bottom tier
and he needs this outrage just like Castro needs his outrage in order to
get any attention.

JARRETT: Yes, you know initially Joe his campaign, Beto`s campaign took
off like a rocket, since then it`s gone down like the Hindenburg (ph)
fasten Bernie. Is that the risk you run when you suddenly become a media
darling at the hands of Vanity Fair?

JOE CONCHA, THE HILL REPORTER: Yes, I mean there is the It girl, right
Gregg. And then he was the It guy, and then he didn`t live up to those
expectations. People thought that well, because he ran within a couple
points of Ted Cruz in Texas, therefore he must be a viable presidential
candidate.

But look, at this point, if you look at the polling with Beto O`Rourke
in terms of his gravitas which he doesn`t had any, he doesn`t have
presidency, he doesn`t fill the screen. He is running for Vice President
at this point.

If Elizabeth Warren gets the nomination, he is positioning himself as a
Vice Presidential candidate or possibility instead of actually winning
the Presidency, because he has no short of doing that.

He pulled out everything after El Paso in terms of calling the President
a White Supremacist, a racist, it didn`t get him anywhere in terms of
jumping the polls and now at this point, he is planning for second
place, not first Gregg.

JARRETT: So--

WEBB: But if I could just interject Joe and I agree with you, he is
trying to play for second place. The second place, the second part of
the ticket usually is a compliment, he`s not a compliment to Elizabeth
Warren, he`s not a compliment to any of them, he advocates for open
borders, for socialist policies. So, I don`t think he is even qualified
for that.

JARRETT: I want to switch--

CONCHA: David, not even open borders. He actually told Chris Hayes of
MSNBC during an interview, a couple of months ago, that he would tear
down the borders around El Paso, not even open, he wants to take down
walls altogether. That`s even beyond open borders, but again that seems
to be the way the Democratic Party is going on that issue in terms of
not just allowing people to come in illegally, but also knocking down
walls that are keeping them from coming in legally.

JARRETT: All right. Well, we`ve run out of time for me to trash
Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. For accusing the police officer in
the shooting death of Michael Brown of murder when in fact, they`re both
lawyers. I mean come on; they know the definition of murder. Go ahead.

CONCHA: Gregg one point. PolitiFact never fact-checked Elizabeth
Warren`s claim that she is part Cherokee Indian. Now, if you`re a
fact-checking agency, I would think that would be at the top of the list
in terms of things you fact-check and don`t fact-check. That`s all you
need to know about PolitiFact and Elizabeth Warren in terms of their
decision here and their treatment of her in general.

JARRETT: Well, I have my own beef with PolitiFact, they criticize my
book, by only reading the preface and not book. Way to go, guys.

WEBB: Not new news.

JARRETT: Yes, we`ll be right back. Don`t go away.

JARRETT: And welcome back to the special edition Hannity. Intrigued
surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case continues to mount following his
death with so many unanswered questions still looming.

Fox News Chief Breaking News Correspondent, Trace Gallagher with more.
Trace.

TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Gregg while the
investigations into Jeffrey Epstein move forward, a big focus will now
be on the women in his life, including alleged victims and potential
accomplices like his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell who has some
accused of helping orchestrate Epstein`s teenage sex ring.

And despite, reports that Maxwell was living on the East Coast,
yesterday she was spotted on the West Coast in a Southern California
in-and-out burger reading a novel about the CIA. Actually, a non-fiction
book about the CIA.

Maxwell has not yet spoken about Epstein`s death or the accusations
against her. Meantime, one day, after he was taken off of suicide watch,
Epstein reportedly spent two hours with a mystery woman, possibly from
his legal team. A different attorney visiting the jail told NBC news,
the "optics were startling because the woman was young and pretty." And
on it goes. Gregg.

JARRETT: Trace Gallagher. Trace, thanks. Unfortunately, that`s all the
time we have for this evening. As always, thanks for being with us. And
by the way, if you haven`t already, make sure to order a copy of my new
book, Witch Hunt, the story of a greatest mass delusion in American
political history. You can order it online and all the usual places.

Sean will be back Monday. Have a great weekend.

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Plywood and
Composite Wood Products Residual Risk and Technology Review

Impact News Service

September 7, 2019 Saturday

Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved

[]

Length: 42103 words

Body

Washington, DC: This Proposed Rule document was issued by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Action

Proposed rule.Summary

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to
the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP)
for Plywood and Composite Wood Products (PCWP) to address the results of
the residual risk and technology review (RTR) that the EPA is required
to conduct under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA is proposing to amend
provisions addressing periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction
(SSM); add provisions regarding electronic reporting; add repeat
emissions testing requirements; and make technical and editorial
changes. The EPA is proposing these amendments to improve the
effectiveness of the NESHAP. While the proposed amendments would not
result in reductions in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP),
this action, if finalized, would result in improved monitoring,
compliance, and implementation of the rule.Dates

Comments. Comments must be received on or before October 21, 2019. Under
the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), comments on the information
collection provisions are best assured of consideration if the Office of

Table 1 of this preamble lists the NESHAP and associated regulated
industrial source category that is the subject of this proposal. Table 1
is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather provides a guide for
readers regarding the entities that this proposed action is likely to
affect. The proposed standards, once promulgated, will be directly
applicable to the affected sources. Federal, state, local, and tribal
government entities would not be affected by this proposed action. As
defined in the Initial List of Categories of Sources Under Section
112(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (see 57 FR 31576, July
16, 1992) and Documentation for Developing the Initial Source Category
List, Final Report (see EPA-450/3-91-030, July 1992), the Plywood and
Particleboard source category is any facility engaged in the
manufacturing of plywood and/or particle boards. This category includes,
but is not limited to, manufacturing of chip waferboard, strandboard,
waferboard, hardboard/cellulosic fiber board, oriented strandboard
(OSB), hardboard plywood, medium density fiberboard (MDF),
particleboard, softwood plywood, or other processes using wood and
binder systems. The name of the source category was changed to Plywood
and Composite Wood Products (PCWP) on November 18, 1999 (64 FR 63025),
to more accurately reflect the types of manufacturing facilities covered
by the source category. In addition, when the EPA proposed the PCWP rule
on January 9, 2003 (68 FR 1276), the scope of the source category was
broadened to include lumber kilns located at stand-alone kiln-dried
lumber manufacturing facilities or at any other type of facility.Table

A redline version of the regulatory language that incorporates the
proposed changes in this action is available in the docket for this
action (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243).II. BackgroundA. What is the
statutory authority for this action?

The statutory authority for this action is provided by sections 112 and
301 of the CAA, as amended (42 U.S.C 7401 et seq.). Section 112 of the
CAA establishes a two-stage regulatory process to develop standards for
emissions of HAP from stationary sources. Generally, the first stage
involves establishing technology-based standards and the second stage
involves evaluating those standards that are based on maximum achievable
control technology (MACT) to determine whether additional standards are
needed to address any remaining risk associated with HAP emissions. This
second stage is commonly referred to as the “residual risk review.” In
addition to the residual risk review, the CAA also requires the EPA to
review standards set under CAA section 112 every 8 years to determine if
there are “developments in practices, processes, or control
technologies” that may be appropriate to incorporate into the standards.
This review is commonly referred to as the “technology review.” When the
two reviews are combined into a single rulemaking, it is commonly
referred to as the “risk and technology review.” The discussion that
follows identifies the most relevant statutory sections and briefly
explains the contours of the methodology used to implement these
statutory requirements. A more comprehensive discussion appears in the
document titled CAA Section 112 Risk and Technology Reviews: Statutory
Authority and Methodology, in the docket for this rulemaking.

In the first stage of the CAA section 112 standard setting process, the
EPA promulgates technology-based standards under CAA section 112(d) for
categories of sources identified as emitting one or more of the HAP
listed in CAA section 112(b). Sources of HAP emissions are either major
sources or area sources, and CAA section 112 establishes different
requirements for major source standards and area source standards.
“Major sources” are those that emit or have the potential to emit 10
tons per year (tpy) or more of a single HAP or 25 tpy or more of any
combination of HAP. All other sources are “area sources.” For major
sources, CAA section 112(d)(2) provides that the technology-based NESHAP
must reflect the maximum degree of emission reductions of HAP achievable
(after considering cost, energy requirements, and non-air quality health
and environmental impacts). These standards are commonly referred to as
MACT standards. CAA section 112(d)(3) also establishes a minimum control
level for MACT standards, known as the MACT “floor.” The EPA must also
consider control options that are more stringent than the floor.
Standards more stringent than the floor are commonly referred to as
beyond-the-floor standards. In certain instances, as provided in CAA
section 112(h), the EPA may set work practice standards where it is not
feasible to prescribe or enforce a numerical emission standard. For area
sources, CAA section 112(d)(5) gives the EPA discretion to set standards
based on generally available control technologies or management
practices (GACT standards) in lieu of MACT standards.

The second stage in standard-setting focuses on identifying and
addressing any remaining (i.e , “residual”) risk according to CAA
section 112(f). For source categories subject to MACT standards, section
112(f)(2) of the CAA requires the EPA to determine whether promulgation
of additional standards is needed to provide an ample margin of safety
to protect public health or to prevent an adverse environmental effect.
Section 112(d)(5) of the CAA provides that this residual risk review is
not required for categories of area sources subject to GACT standards.
Section 112(f)(2)(B) of the CAA further expressly preserves the EPA's
use of the two-step approach for developing standards to address any
residual risk and the Agency's interpretation of “ample margin of
safety” developed in the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants: Benzene Emissions from Maleic Anhydride Plants,
Ethylbenzene/Styrene Plants, Benzene Storage Vessels, Benzene Equipment
Leaks, and Coke By-Product Recovery Plants (Benzene NESHAP) (54 FR
38044, September 14, 1989). The EPA notified Congress in the Risk Report
that the Agency intended to use the Benzene NESHAP approach in making
CAA section 112(f) residual risk determinations (EPA-453/R-99-001, p.
ES-11). The EPA subsequently adopted this approach in its residual risk
determinations and the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit (the Court) upheld the EPA's interpretation that CAA
section 112(f)(2) incorporates the approach established in the Benzene
NESHAP. See NRDC v. EPA, 529 F.3d 1077, 1083 (D.C Cir. 2008).

The approach incorporated into the CAA and used by the EPA to evaluate
residual risk and to develop standards under CAA section 112(f)(2) is a
two-step approach. In the first step, the EPA determines whether risks
are acceptable. This determination “considers all health information,
including risk estimation uncertainty, and includes a presumptive limit
on maximum individual lifetime [cancer] risk (MIR) (1) of approximately
1 in 10 thousand.” 54 FR 38045, September 14, 1989. If risks are
unacceptable, the EPA must determine the emissions standards necessary
to reduce risk to an acceptable level without considering costs. In the
second step of the approach, the EPA considers whether the emissions
standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health “in
consideration of all health information, including the number of persons
at risk levels higher than approximately 1 in 1 million, as well as
other relevant factors, including costs and economic impacts,
technological feasibility, and other factors relevant to each particular
decision.” Id. The EPA must promulgate emission standards necessary to
provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or determine
that the standards being reviewed provide an ample margin of safety
without any revisions. After conducting the ample margin of safety
analysis, the EPA considers whether a more stringent standard is
necessary to prevent, taking into consideration costs, energy, safety,
and other relevant factors, an adverse environmental effect.

CAA section 112(d)(6) separately requires the EPA to review standards
promulgated under CAA section 112 and revise them “as necessary (taking
into account developments in practices, processes, and control
technologies)” no less often than every 8 years. In conducting this
review, which the EPA calls the “technology review,” the EPA is not
required to recalculate the MACT floor. Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC) v. EPA, 529 F.3d 1077, 1084 (D.C Cir. 2008). Association
of Battery Recyclers, Inc. v. EPA, 716 F.3d 667 (D.C Cir. 2013). The EPA
may consider cost in deciding whether to revise the standards pursuant
to CAA section 112(d)(6).B. What is this source category and how does
the current NESHAP regulate its HAP emissions?

Plywood and composite wood products are manufactured by bonding wood
material (fibers, particles, strands, etc.) or agricultural fiber,
generally with resin under heat and pressure, to form a structural panel
or engineered wood product. Plywood and composite wood products
manufacturing facilities also include facilities that manufacture dry
veneer and lumber kilns located at any facility. Plywood and composite
wood products include (but are not limited to) plywood, veneer,
particleboard, OSB, hardboard, fiberboard, medium density fiberboard,
laminated strand lumber, laminated veneer lumber, wood I-joists,
kiln-dried lumber, and glue-laminated beams.

This proposal includes both a residual risk assessment and a technology
review of the standards applicable to emission sources subject to the
PCWP NESHAP. The NESHAP contains several compliance options for process
units subject to the standards: (1) Installation and use of emissions
control systems with an efficiency of at least 90 percent; (2)
production-based limits that restrict HAP emissions per unit of product
produced; and (3) emissions averaging that allows control of emissions
from a group of sources collectively (at existing affected sources).
These compliance options apply for the following process units:
Fiberboard mat dryer heated zones (at new affected sources); green
rotary dryers; hardboard ovens; press predryers (at new affected
sources); pressurized refiners; primary tube dryers; secondary tube
dryers; reconstituted wood product board coolers (at new affected
sources); reconstituted wood product presses; softwood veneer dryer
heated zones; rotary strand dryers; and conveyor strand dryers (zone one
at existing affected sources, and zones one and two at new affected
sources). In addition, the PCWP NESHAP includes work practice standards
for dry rotary dryers, hardwood veneer dryers, softwood veneer dryers,
veneer redryers, and group 1 miscellaneous coating operations (defined
in 40 CFR 63.2292).

In 2007, the D.C Circuit remanded and vacated portions of the 2004
NESHAP promulgated by the EPA to establish MACT standards for the PCWP
source category. NRDC v. EPA, 489 F.3d 1364 (D.C Cir. 2007). The EPA
will address the partial remand and vacatur of the 2004 rule in a future
action. The EPA is not addressing the partial remand and vacatur in this
RTR. The Court vacated and remanded portions of the 2004 rule based on
certain aspects of the MACT determinations made by the EPA. In the 2004
rule, the EPA had concluded that the MACT standards for several process
units were represented by no emission reduction (or “no control”
emission floors). The “no control” MACT conclusions were rejected
because, as the Court clarified, in a related decision, the EPA must
establish emission standards for listed HAP. 489 F.3d 1364, 1371, citing
Sierra v. EPA, 479 F.3d 875 (D.C Cir. 2007).

To address the remand, the EPA plans to develop emission standards for
the relevant process units in a separate action subsequent to this
proposed RTR action for the source category. As noted below, the EPA
conducted an information collection prior to beginning the RTR process
which supplemented the available HAP emission inventory for the
category. The EPA will evaluate the data collected and any additional
information submitted before initiating the rulemaking to address the
remand.C. What data collection activities were conducted to support this
action?

On October 5, 2017, the EPA issued an Information Collection Request
(ICR) to gather information from PCWP manufacturers to support
conducting the PCWP NESHAP RTR. The ICR gathered detailed process data,
emission release point characteristics, and HAP emissions data for PCWP
process units located at major sources. The response rate for the ICR
was over 99 percent. For more details on the data collection conducted
to prepare inputs for the residual risk assessment, see the memorandum
titled Preparation of the Residual Risk Modeling Inputs File for the
PCWP NESHAP in the docket for this rulemaking. For more details on the
data collection conducted for the technology review, see the memoranda
titled Technology Review for the Plywood and Composite Wood Products
NESHAP and Compilation of the Plywood and Composite Wood Products (PCWP)
Information Collection Request (ICR) Responses into an ICR-Response Data
Base, also available in the docket.D. What other relevant background
information and data are available?

In addition to ICR data spreadsheets provided by respondents, the EPA
reviewed other information sources to determine if there have been
developments in practices, processes, or control technologies by PCWP
facilities to support the technology review of the NESHAP. These
information sources include:

Emissions data (e.g , stack test reports, emissions calculations)
submitted with survey responses; Facility operating permits submitted
with survey responses or obtained from state agencies; Semiannual
compliance reports submitted with survey responses; Other documentation
submitted with survey responses (e.g , compliance calculations; process
flow diagrams); Information and data analyses submitted by industry
organizations; Information obtained during site visits and meetings with
stakeholders; Information on air pollution control options in the PCWP
industry from the EPA's Reasonably Available Control Technology/Best
Available Control Technology/Lowest Achievable Emission Rate
Clearinghouse; Information on applicability and compliance issues from
the EPA's Applicability Determination Index; and Literature review of
recent information on PCWP practices, processes, and control
technologies.

III. Analytical Procedures and Decision-Making

In this section, the EPA describes the analyses performed to support the
proposed decisions for the RTR and other issues addressed in this
proposal.A. How do we consider risk in our decision-making?

As discussed in section II.A of this preamble and in the Benzene NESHAP,
in evaluating and developing standards under CAA section 112(f)(2), the
EPA applies a two-step approach to determine whether or not risks are
acceptable and to determine if the standards provide an ample margin of
safety to protect public health. As explained in the Benzene NESHAP,
“the first step judgment on acceptability cannot be reduced to any
single factor” and, thus, “[t]he Administrator believes that the
acceptability of risk under section 112 is best judged on the basis of a
broad set of health risk measures and information.” 54 FR 38046,
September 14, 1989. Similarly, with regard to the ample margin of safety
determination, “the Agency again considers all of the health risk and
other health information considered in the first step. Beyond that
information, additional factors relating to the appropriate level of
control will also be considered, including cost and economic impacts of
controls, technological feasibility, uncertainties, and any other
relevant factors.” Id.

The Benzene NESHAP approach provides flexibility regarding factors the
EPA may consider in making determinations and how the EPA may weigh
those factors for each source category. The EPA conducts a risk
assessment that provides estimates of the MIR posed by the HAP emissions
from each source in the source category, the hazard index (HI) for
chronic exposures to HAP with the potential to cause noncancer health
effects, and the hazard quotient (HQ) for acute exposures to HAP with
the potential to cause noncancer health effects. (2) The assessment also
provides estimates of the distribution of cancer risk within the exposed
populations, cancer incidence, and an evaluation of the potential for an
adverse environmental effect. The scope of the EPA's risk analysis is
consistent with the EPA's response to comments on our policy under the
Benzene NESHAP where the EPA explained that:

[t]he policy chosen by the Administrator permits consideration of
multiple measures of health risk. Not only can the MIR figure be
considered, but also incidence, the presence of non-cancer health
effects, and the uncertainties of the risk estimates. In this way, the
effect on the most exposed individuals can be reviewed as well as the
impact on the general public. These factors can then be weighed in each
individual case. This approach complies with the Vinyl Chloride mandate
that the Administrator ascertain an acceptable level of risk to the
public by employing his expertise to assess available data. It also
complies with the Congressional intent behind the CAA, which did not
exclude the use of any particular measure of public health risk from the
EPA's consideration with respect to CAA section 112 regulations, and
thereby implicitly permits consideration of any and all measures of
health risk which the Administrator, in his judgment, believes are
appropriate to determining what will `protect the public health'.

See 54 FR 38057, September 14, 1989. Thus, the level of the MIR is only
one factor to be weighed in determining acceptability of risk. The
Benzene NESHAP explained that “an MIR of approximately one in 10
thousand should ordinarily be the upper end of the range of
acceptability. As risks increase above this benchmark, they become
presumptively less acceptable under CAA section 112, and would be
weighed with the other health risk measures and information in making an
overall judgment on acceptability. Or, the Agency may find, in a
particular case, that a risk that includes an MIR less than the
presumptively acceptable level is unacceptable in the light of other
health risk factors.” Id. at 38045. In other words, risks that include
an MIR where 100-in-1 million may be determined to be acceptable and
risks with an MIR below that level may be determined to be unacceptable,
depending on all of the available information. Similarly, with regard to
the ample margin of safety analysis, the EPA stated in the Benzene
NESHAP that: “EPA believes the relative weight of the many factors that
can be considered in selecting an ample margin of safety can only be
determined for each specific source category. This occurs mainly because
technological and economic factors (along with the health-related
factors) vary from source category to source category.” Id. at 38061.
The EPA also considers the uncertainties associated with the various
risk analyses, as discussed earlier in this preamble, in our
determinations of acceptability and ample margin of safety.

The EPA notes that we have not considered certain health information to
date in making residual risk determinations. At this time, the EPA does
not attempt to quantify the HAP risk that may be associated with
emissions from other facilities that do not include the source category
under review, mobile source emissions, natural source emissions,
persistent environmental pollution, or atmospheric transformation in the
vicinity of the sources in the category.

The EPA understands the potential importance of considering an
individual's total exposure to HAP in addition to considering exposure
to HAP emissions from the source category and facility. The EPA
recognizes that such consideration may be particularly important when
assessing noncancer risk, where pollutant-specific exposure health
reference levels (e.g , reference concentrations (RfCs)) are based on
the assumption that thresholds exist for adverse health effects. For
example, the EPA recognizes that, although exposures attributable to
emissions from a source category or facility alone may not indicate the
potential for increased risk of adverse noncancer health effects in a
population, the exposures resulting from emissions from the facility in
combination with emissions from all of the other sources (e.g , other
facilities) to which an individual is exposed may be sufficient to
result in an increased risk of adverse noncancer health effects. In May
2010, the Science Advisory Board (SAB) advised the EPA “that RTR
assessments will be most useful to decision makers and communities if
results are presented in the broader context of aggregate and cumulative
risks, including background concentrations and contributions from other
sources in the area.” (3)

In response to the SAB recommendations, the EPA incorporates cumulative
risk analyses into its RTR risk assessments, including those reflected
in this proposal. The Agency (1) conducts facility-wide assessments,
which include source category emission points, as well as other emission
points within the facilities; (2) combines exposures from multiple
sources in the same category that could affect the same individuals; and
(3) for some persistent and bioaccumulative pollutants, analyzes the
ingestion route of exposure. In addition, the RTR risk assessments
consider aggregate cancer risk from all carcinogens and aggregated
noncancer HQs for all noncarcinogens affecting the same target organ or
target organ system.

Although the EPA is interested in placing source category and
facility-wide HAP risk in the context of total HAP risk from all sources
combined in the vicinity of each source, we are concerned about the
uncertainties of doing so. Estimates of total HAP risk from emission
sources other than those that the EPA has studied in depth during this
RTR review would have significantly greater associated uncertainties
than the source category or facility-wide estimates. Such aggregate or
cumulative assessments would compound those uncertainties, making the
assessments too unreliable.B. How do we perform the technology review?

Our technology review focuses on the identification and evaluation of
developments in practices, processes, and control technologies that have
occurred since the MACT standards were promulgated. Where the EPA
identifies such developments, we analyze their technical feasibility,
estimated costs, energy implications, and non-air environmental impacts.
The EPA also considers the emission reductions associated with applying
each development. This analysis informs our decision of whether it is
“necessary” to revise the emissions standards. In addition, the EPA
considers the appropriateness of applying controls to new sources versus
retrofitting existing sources. For this exercise, we consider any of the
following to be a “development”:

Any add-on control technology or other equipment that was not identified
and considered during development of the original MACT standards; Any
improvements in add-on control technology or other equipment (that were
identified and considered during development of the original MACT
standards) that could result in additional emissions reduction; Any work
practice or operational procedure that was not identified or considered
during development of the original MACT standards; Any process change or
pollution prevention alternative that could be broadly applied to the
industry and that was not identified or considered during development of
the original MACT standards; and Any significant changes in the cost
(including cost effectiveness) of applying controls (including controls
the EPA considered during the development of the original MACT
standards).

In addition to reviewing the practices, processes, and control
technologies that were considered at the time the EPA originally
developed the NESHAP, we review a variety of data sources in our
investigation of potential practices, processes, or controls to
consider. See sections II.C and II.D of this preamble for information on
the specific data sources that were reviewed as part of the technology
review.C. How do we estimate post-MACT risk posed by the source
category?

In this section, we provide a complete description of the types of
analyses that the EPA generally performs during the risk assessment
process. In some cases, the EPA does not perform a specific analysis
because it is not relevant. For example, in the absence of emissions of
HAP known to be persistent and bioaccumulative in the environment
(PB-HAP), the EPA would not perform a multipathway exposure assessment.
Where the EPA does not perform an analysis, we state that we do not and
provide the reason. While we present all of our risk assessment methods,
we only present risk assessment results for the analyses actually
conducted (see section IV.A of this preamble).

The EPA conducts a risk assessment that provides estimates of the MIR
for cancer posed by the HAP emissions from each source in the source
category, the HI for chronic exposures to HAP with the potential to
cause noncancer health effects, and the HQ for acute exposures to HAP
with the potential to cause noncancer health effects. The assessment
also provides estimates of the distribution of cancer risk within the
exposed populations, cancer incidence, and an evaluation of the
potential for an adverse environmental effect. The seven sections that
follow this paragraph describe how the EPA estimated emissions and
conducted the risk assessment. The docket for this rulemaking contains
the following document which provides more information on the risk
assessment inputs and models: Residual Risk Assessment for the Plywood
and Composite Wood Products Source Category in Support of the 2019 Risk
and Technology Review Proposed Rule. The methods used to assess risk (as
described in the seven primary steps below) are consistent with those
described by the EPA in the document reviewed by a panel of the EPA's
SAB in 2009; (4) and described in the SAB review report issued in 2010.
They are also consistent with the key recommendations contained in that
report.1. How did we estimate actual emissions and identify the
emissions release characteristics?

In October 2017, the EPA initiated an ICR to gather information from U.S
PCWP manufacturers to support conducting the PCWP RTR. The ICR response
period ended in February 2018. The ICR gathered process data, emission
release point characteristics, coordinates, and HAP emissions data for
PCWP process units located at major sources of HAP. Assembly and quality
assurance of the ICR data needed to construct the residual risk modeling
file for the PCWP source category is discussed in Preparation of
Residual Risk Modeling Inputs File for the PCWP NESHAP, which is
available in the docket for this action.2. How did we estimate
MACT-allowable emissions?

The available emissions data in the RTR emissions dataset include
estimates of the mass of HAP emitted during a specified annual time
period. These “actual” emission levels are often lower than the emission
levels allowed under the requirements of the current MACT standards. The
emissions allowed under the MACT standards are referred to as the
“MACT-allowable” emissions. The EPA discussed the consideration of both
MACT-allowable and actual emissions in the final Coke Oven Batteries RTR
(70 FR 19998-19999, April 15, 2005) and in the proposed and final
Hazardous Organic NESHAP RTR (71 FR 34428, June 14, 2006, and 71 FR
76609, December 21, 2006, respectively). In those actions, the EPA noted
that assessing the risk at the MACT-allowable level is inherently
reasonable since that risk reflects the maximum level facilities could
emit and still comply with national emission standards. The EPA also
explained that it is reasonable to consider actual emissions, where such
data are available, in both steps of the risk analysis, in accordance
with the Benzene NESHAP approach. (54 FR 38044, September 14, 1989.)

The PCWP ICR requested that respondents provide estimates of allowable
emissions based on their site-specific circumstances (e.g , control
measures in place). Therefore, unlike other RTR projects that develop a
multiplier to estimate allowable emissions from actual emissions
reported in the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), the directly
reported ICR data for allowable emissions were used for the PCWP
category. (5)

The allowable emissions estimates provided by the ICR respondents were
reviewed for completeness and to ensure they made sense relative to
actual emissions. Approximately 95 percent of the allowable emissions
estimates provided by respondents were reasonable and were used without
revision. The remaining allowable emission estimates were either
missing, provided as zero, or otherwise suspect compared to actual
emissions. Because nearly all the allowable emissions estimates in need
of gap-filling were for process units without PCWP MACT standards
requiring use of add-on controls, the gaps and adjustments were
completed by setting the MACT-allowable emission rates equal to the
actual emission rates. (6)3. How do we conduct dispersion modeling,
determine inhalation exposures, and estimate individual and population
inhalation risk?

Both long-term and short-term inhalation exposure concentrations and
health risk from the source category addressed in this proposal were
estimated using the Human Exposure Model (HEM-3). (7) The HEM-3 performs
three primary risk assessment activities: (1) Conducting dispersion
modeling to estimate the concentrations of HAP in ambient air, (2)
estimating long-term and short-term inhalation exposures to individuals
residing within 50 kilometers (km) of the modeled sources, and (3)
estimating individual and population-level inhalation risk using the
exposure estimates and quantitative dose-response information.a.
Dispersion Modeling

The air dispersion model AERMOD, used by the HEM-3 model, is one of the
EPA's preferred models for assessing air pollutant concentrations from
industrial facilities. (8) To perform the dispersion modeling and to
develop the preliminary risk estimates, HEM-3 draws on three data
libraries. The first is a library of meteorological data, which is used
for dispersion calculations. This library includes 1 year (2016) of
hourly surface and upper air observations from 824 meteorological
stations, selected to provide coverage of the United States and Puerto
Rico. A second library of United States Census Bureau census block (9)
internal point locations and populations provides the basis of human
exposure calculations (U.S Census, 2010). In addition, for each census
block, the census library includes the elevation and controlling hill
height, which are also used in dispersion calculations. A third library
of pollutant-specific dose-response values is used to estimate health
risk. These are discussed below.b. Risk From Chronic Exposure to HAP

In developing the risk assessment for chronic exposures, the EPA uses
the estimated annual average ambient air concentrations of each HAP
emitted by each source in the source category. The HAP air
concentrations at each nearby census block centroid located within 50 km
of the facility are a surrogate for the chronic inhalation exposure
concentration for all the people who reside in that census block. A
distance of 50 km is consistent with both the analysis supporting the
1989 Benzene NESHAP (54 FR 38044, September 14, 1989) and the
limitations of Gaussian dispersion models, including AERMOD.

For each facility, the EPA calculates the MIR as the cancer risk
associated with a continuous lifetime (24 hours per day, 7 days per
week, 52 weeks per year, 70 years) exposure to the maximum concentration
at the centroid of each inhabited census block. The EPA calculates
individual cancer risk by multiplying the estimated lifetime exposure to
the ambient concentration of each HAP (in micrograms per cubic meter
(μg/m 3)) by its unit risk estimate (URE). The URE is an upper-bound
estimate of an individual's incremental risk of contracting cancer over
a lifetime of exposure to a concentration of 1 microgram of the
pollutant per cubic meter of air. For residual risk assessments, the EPA
generally uses UREs from the EPA's Integrated Risk Information System
(IRIS). For carcinogenic pollutants without IRIS values, the EPA looks
to other reputable sources of cancer dose-response values, often using
California EPA (CalEPA) UREs, where available. In cases where new,
scientifically credible dose-response values have been developed in a
manner consistent with EPA guidelines and have undergone a peer review
process similar to that used by the EPA, the EPA may use such
dose-response values in place of, or in addition to, other values, if
appropriate. The pollutant-specific dose-response values used to
estimate health risk are available at
https://www.epa.gov/fera/dose-response-assessment-assessing-health-risks-associated-exposure-hazardous-air-pollutants.

To estimate individual lifetime cancer risks associated with exposure to
HAP emissions from each facility in the source category, the EPA sums
the risks for each of the carcinogenic HAP (10) emitted by the modeled
facility. The EPA estimates cancer risk at every census block within 50
km of every facility in the source category. The MIR is the highest
individual lifetime cancer risk estimated for any of those census
blocks. In addition to calculating the MIR, the EPA estimates the
distribution of individual cancer risks for the source category by
summing the number of individuals within 50 km of the sources whose
estimated risk falls within a specified risk range. The EPA also
estimates annual cancer incidence by multiplying the estimated lifetime
cancer risk at each census block by the number of people residing in
that block, summing results for all of the census blocks, and then
dividing this result by a 70-year lifetime.

To assess the risk of noncancer health effects from chronic exposure to
HAP, the EPA calculates either an HQ or a target organ-specific hazard
index (TOSHI). The EPA calculates an HQ when a single noncancer HAP is
emitted. Where more than one noncancer HAP is emitted, the EPA sums the
HQ for each of the HAP that affects a common target organ or target
organ system to obtain a TOSHI. The HQ is the estimated exposure divided
by the chronic noncancer dose-response value, which is a value selected
from one of several sources. The preferred chronic noncancer
dose-response value is the EPA RfC, defined as “an estimate (with
uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous
inhalation exposure to the human population (including sensitive
subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of
deleterious effects during a lifetime”
(https://iaspub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/termreg/searchandretrieve/glossariesandkeywordlists/search.do?details=&vocabName=IRIS%20Glossary).
In cases where an RfC from the EPA's IRIS is not available or where the
EPA determines that using a value other than the RfC is appropriate, the
chronic noncancer dose-response value can be a value from the following
prioritized sources, which define their dose-response values similarly
to the EPA: (1) The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) Minimum Risk Level (  
https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mrls/index.asp); (2) the CalEPA Chronic
Reference Exposure Level (REL) (  
https://oehha.ca.gov/air/crnr/notice-adoption-air-toxics-hot-spots-program-guidance-manual-preparation-health-risk-0);
or (3) as noted above, a scientifically credible dose-response value
that has been developed in a manner consistent with the EPA guidelines
and has undergone a peer review process similar to that used by the EPA.
The pollutant-specific dose-response values used to estimate health
risks are available at  
https://www.epa.gov/fera/dose-response-assessment-assessing-health-risks-associated-exposure-hazardous-air-pollutants.c.
Risk From Acute Exposure to HAP That May Cause Health Effects Other Than
Cancer

For each HAP for which appropriate acute inhalation dose-response values
are available, the EPA also assesses the potential health risks due to
acute exposure. For these assessments, the EPA makes conservative
assumptions about emission rates, meteorology, and exposure location. In
this proposed rulemaking, as part of the EPA's efforts to continually
improve our methodologies to evaluate the risks that HAP emitted from
categories of industrial sources pose to human health and the
environment, (11) we are revising our treatment of meteorological data
to use reasonable worst-case air dispersion conditions in our acute risk
screening assessments instead of worst-case air dispersion conditions.
This revised treatment of meteorological data and the supporting
rationale are described in more detail in Residual Risk Assessment for
the Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category in Support of
the 2019 Risk and Technology Review Proposed Rule and in Appendix 5 of
the report: Technical Support Document for Acute Risk Screening
Assessment. The EPA will be applying this revision in RTR rulemakings
proposed on or after June 3, 2019.

To assess the potential acute risk to the maximally exposed individual,
the EPA uses the peak hourly emission rate for each emission point, (12)
reasonable worst-case air dispersion conditions (i.e , 99th percentile),
and the point of highest off-site exposure. Specifically, the EPA
assumes that peak emissions from the source category and reasonable
worst-case air dispersion conditions co-occur and that a person is
present at the point of maximum exposure.

To characterize the potential health risks associated with estimated
acute inhalation exposures to a HAP, the EPA generally uses multiple
acute dose-response values, including acute RELs, acute exposure
guideline levels (AEGLs), and emergency response planning guidelines
(ERPG) for 1-hour exposure durations, if available, to calculate acute
HQs. The acute HQ is calculated by dividing the estimated acute exposure
concentration by the acute dose-response value. For each HAP for which
acute dose-response values are available, the EPA calculates acute HQs.

An acute REL is defined as “the concentration level at or below which no
adverse health effects are anticipated for a specified exposure
duration.” (13) Acute RELs are based on the most sensitive, relevant,
adverse health effect reported in the peer-reviewed medical and
toxicological literature. They are designed to protect the most
sensitive individuals in the population through the inclusion of margins
of safety. Because margins of safety are incorporated to address data
gaps and uncertainties, exceeding the REL does not automatically
indicate an adverse health impact. AEGLs represent threshold exposure
limits for the general public and are applicable to emergency exposures
ranging from 10 minutes to 8 hours. (14) They are guideline levels for
“once-in-a-lifetime, short-term exposures to airborne concentrations of
acutely toxic, high-priority chemicals.” Id. at 21. The AEGL-1 is
specifically defined as “the airborne concentration (expressed as ppm
(parts per million) or mg/m 3 (milligrams per cubic meter)) of a
substance above which it is predicted that the general population,
including susceptible individuals, could experience notable discomfort,
irritation, or certain asymptomatic nonsensory effects. However, the
effects are not disabling and are transient and reversible upon
cessation of exposure.” The document also notes that “Airborne
concentrations below AEGL-1 represent exposure levels that can produce
mild and progressively increasing but transient and nondisabling odor,
taste, and sensory irritation or certain asymptomatic, nonsensory
effects.” Id. AEGL-2 are defined as “the airborne concentration
(expressed as parts per million or milligrams per cubic meter) of a
substance above which it is predicted that the general population,
including susceptible individuals, could experience irreversible or
other serious, long-lasting adverse health effects or an impaired
ability to escape.” Id.

ERPGs are “developed for emergency planning and are intended as
health-based guideline concentrations for single exposures to
chemicals.” (15) Id. at 1. The ERPG-1 is defined as “the maximum
airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all
individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing other
than mild transient adverse health effects or without perceiving a
clearly defined, objectionable odor.” Id. at 2. Similarly, the ERPG-2 is
defined as “the maximum airborne concentration below which it is
believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour
without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health
effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take
protective action.” Id. at 1.

An acute REL for 1-hour exposure durations is typically lower than its
corresponding AEGL-1 and ERPG-1. Even though their definitions are
slightly different, AEGL-1s are often the same as the corresponding
ERPG-1s, and AEGL-2s are often equal to ERPG-2s. The maximum HQs from
the EPA's acute inhalation screening risk assessment typically result
when we use the acute REL for a HAP. In cases where the maximum acute HQ
exceeds 1, the EPA also reports the HQ based on the next highest acute
dose-response value (usually the AEGL-1 and/or the ERPG-1).

For this source category, estimates of short-term (maximum hourly)
emissions were submitted by PCWP ICR respondents. In our review of the
ICR data, the EPA compared the short-term emission estimates to annual
emissions estimates to ensure the short-term emission estimates were
reasonable. The EPA gap-filled short-term emission estimates that were
missing or found to be invalid with short-term emission estimates
calculated using a PCWP emission process-specific acute multiplier. The
acute multiplier, which is a factor multiplied by annual emissions to
estimate maximum hourly emissions, was derived from the ICR data for
each emissions process group. The acute factors used to gap-fill missing
or invalid short-term emission estimates in the PCWP ICR inventory
ranged from 1.2 to 10. Further discussion of the process-specific
factors chosen to fill gaps in the ICR data can be found in the
memorandum, Preparation of Residual Risk Modeling Inputs File for the
PCWP NESHAP, available in the docket for this rulemaking.

In the EPA's acute inhalation screening risk assessment, acute impacts
are deemed negligible for HAP for which acute HQs are less than or equal
to 1, and no further analysis is performed for these HAP. In cases where
an acute HQ from the screening step is greater than 1, the EPA assesses
the site-specific data to ensure that the acute HQ is at an off-site
location. For this source category, the data refinements employed
consisted of evaluating residential properties outside the facility
boundaries to estimate acute impacts that exceeded an HQ screen of 1.
These refinements are discussed more fully in the Residual Risk
Assessment for the Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category
in Support of the 2019 Risk and Technology Review Proposed Rule, which
is available in the docket for this source category.4. How do we conduct
the multipathway exposure and risk screening assessment?

The EPA conducts a tiered screening assessment examining the potential
for significant human health risks due to exposures via routes other
than inhalation (i.e , ingestion). We first determine whether any
sources in the source category emit any HAP known to be persistent and
bioaccumulative in the environment, as identified in the EPA's Air
Toxics Risk Assessment Library (See Volume 1, Appendix D, at
https://www.epa.gov/fera/risk-assessment-and-modeling-air-toxics-risk-assessment-reference-library).

For the PCWP source category, we identified PB-HAP emissions of arsenic,
polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans (dioxins/furans), polycyclic
organic matter (POM), cadmium, mercury, and lead, so we proceeded to the
next step of the evaluation. Except for lead, the human health risk
screening assessment for PB-HAP consists of three progressive tiers. In
a Tier 1 screening assessment, we determine whether the magnitude of the
facility-specific emissions of PB-HAP warrants further evaluation to
characterize human health risk through ingestion exposure. To facilitate
this step, we evaluate emissions against previously developed screening
threshold emission rates for several PB-HAP that are based on a
hypothetical upper-end screening exposure scenario developed for use in
conjunction with the EPA's Total Risk Integrated Methodology.Fate,
Transport, and Ecological Exposure (TRIM.FaTE) model. The PB-HAP with
screening threshold emission rates are arsenic compounds, cadmium
compounds, dioxins/furans, mercury compounds, and POM. Based on the EPA
estimates of toxicity and bioaccumulation potential, these pollutants
represent a conservative list for inclusion in multipathway risk
assessments for RTR rules. (See Volume 1, Appendix D at
https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-08/documents/volume_1_reflibrary.pdf).
In this assessment, we compare the facility-specific emission rates of
these PB-HAP to the screening threshold emission rates for each PB-HAP
to assess the potential for significant human health risks via the
ingestion pathway. We call this application of the TRIM.FaTE model the
Tier 1 screening assessment. The ratio of a facility's actual emission
rate to the Tier 1 screening threshold emission rate is a “screening
value.”

We derive the Tier 1 screening threshold emission rates for these PB-HAP
(other than lead compounds) to correspond to a maximum excess lifetime
cancer risk of 1-in-1 million (i.e , for arsenic compounds,
dioxins/furans, and POM) or, for HAP that cause noncancer health effects
(i.e , cadmium compounds and mercury compounds), a maximum HQ of 1. If
the emission rate of any one PB-HAP or combination of carcinogenic
PB-HAP in the Tier 1 screening assessment exceeds the Tier 1 screening
threshold emission rate for any facility (i.e , the screening value is
greater than 1), we conduct a second screening assessment, which we call
the Tier 2 screening assessment. The Tier 2 screening assessment
separates the Tier 1 combined fisher and farmer exposure scenario into
fisher, farmer, and gardener scenarios that retain upper-bound ingestion
rates.

In the Tier 2 screening assessment, the location of each facility that
exceeds a Tier 1 screening threshold emission rate is used to refine the
assumptions associated with the Tier 1 fisher/farmer scenarios at that
facility. A key assumption in the Tier 1 screening assessment is that a
lake and/or farm is located near the facility. As part of the Tier 2
screening assessment, we use a U.S Geological Survey (USGS) database to
identify actual waterbodies within 50 km of each facility and assume the
fisher only consumes fish from lakes within that 50 km zone. We also
examine the differences between local meteorology near the facility and
the meteorology used in the Tier 1 screening assessment. We then adjust
the previously-developed Tier 1 screening threshold emission rates for
each PB-HAP for each facility based on an understanding of how exposure
concentrations estimated for the screening scenario change with the use
of local meteorology and the USGS lakes database.

In the Tier 2 farmer scenario, we maintain an assumption that the farm
is located within 0.5 km of the facility and that the farmer consumes
meat, eggs, dairy, vegetables, and fruit produced near the facility. We
may further refine the Tier 2 screening analysis by assessing a gardener
scenario to characterize a range of exposures, with the gardener
scenario being more plausible in RTR evaluations. Under the gardener
scenario, we assume the gardener consumes home-produced eggs,
vegetables, and fruit products at the same ingestion rate as the farmer.
The Tier 2 screen continues to rely on the high-end food intake
assumptions that were applied in Tier 1 for local fish (adult female
angler at 99th percentile fish consumption (16) ) and locally grown or
raised foods (90th percentile consumption of locally grown or raised
foods for the farmer and gardener scenarios (17) ). If PB-HAP emission
rates do not result in a Tier 2 screening value greater than 1, we
consider those PB-HAP emissions to pose risks below a level of concern.
If the PB-HAP emission rates for a facility exceed the Tier 2 screening
threshold emission rates, we may conduct a Tier 3 screening assessment.

There are several analyses that can be included in a Tier 3 screening
assessment, depending upon the extent of refinement warranted, including
validating that the lakes are fishable, locating residential/garden
locations for urban and/or rural settings, considering plume-rise to
estimate emissions lost above the mixing layer, and considering hourly
effects of meteorology and plume rise on chemical fate and transport (a
time-series analysis). If necessary, the EPA may further refine the
screening assessment through a site-specific assessment.

In evaluating the potential multipathway risk from emissions of lead
compounds, rather than developing a screening threshold emission rate,
we compare maximum estimated chronic inhalation exposure concentrations
to the level of the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard
(NAAQS) for lead. (18) Values below the level of the primary
(health-based) lead NAAQS are considered to have a low potential for
multipathway risk.

For further information on the multipathway assessment approach, see
Appendix 6 of the Residual Risk Assessment for the Plywood and Composite
Wood Products Source Category in Support of the 2019 Risk and Technology
Review Proposed Rule, which is available in the docket for this
action.5. How do we conduct the environmental risk screening
assessment?a. Adverse Environmental Effect, Environmental HAP, and
Ecological Benchmarks

The EPA conducts a screening assessment to examine the potential for an
adverse environmental effect as required under section 112(f)(2)(A) of
the CAA. Section 112(a)(7) of the CAA defines “adverse environmental
effect” as “any significant and widespread adverse effect, which may
reasonably be anticipated, to wildlife, aquatic life, or other natural
resources, including adverse impacts on populations of endangered or
threatened species or significant degradation of environmental quality
over broad areas.”

The EPA focuses on eight HAP, which are referred to as “environmental
HAP,” in its screening assessment: Six PB-HAP and two acid gases. The
PB-HAP included in the screening assessment are arsenic compounds,
cadmium compounds, dioxins/furans, POM, mercury (both inorganic mercury
and methyl mercury), and lead compounds. The acid gases included in the
screening assessment are hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride
(HF).

HAP that persist and bioaccumulate are of particular environmental
concern because they accumulate in the soil, sediment, and water. The
acid gases, HCl and HF, are included due to their well-documented
potential to cause direct damage to terrestrial plants. In the
environmental risk screening assessment, the EPA evaluates the following
four exposure media: Terrestrial soils, surface water bodies (includes
water-column and benthic sediments), fish consumed by wildlife, and air.
Within these four exposure media, the EPA evaluates nine ecological
assessment endpoints, which are defined by the ecological entity and its
attributes. For PB-HAP (other than lead), both community-level and
population-level endpoints are included. For acid gases, the ecological
assessment evaluated is terrestrial plant communities.

An ecological benchmark represents a concentration of HAP that has been
linked to a particular environmental effect level. For each
environmental HAP, the EPA identified the available ecological
benchmarks for each assessment endpoint. The EPA identified, where
possible, ecological benchmarks at the following effect levels: Probable
effect levels, lowest-observed-adverse-effect level, and
no-observed-adverse-effect level. In cases where multiple effect levels
were available for a particular PB-HAP and assessment endpoint, the EPA
uses all of the available effect levels to help us to determine whether
ecological risks exist and, if so, whether the risks could be considered
significant and widespread.

For further information on how the environmental risk screening
assessment was conducted, including a discussion of the risk metrics
used, how the environmental HAP were identified, and how the ecological
benchmarks were selected, see Appendix 9 of the Residual Risk Assessment
for the Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category in Support
of the 2019 Risk and Technology Review Proposed Rule, which is available
in the docket for this action.b. Environmental Risk Screening
Methodology

For the environmental risk screening assessment, the EPA first
determined whether any facilities in the PCWP source category emitted
any of the environmental HAP. For the PCWP source category, the EPA
identified emissions of arsenic compounds, cadmium compounds,
dioxins/furans, lead compounds, mercury compounds, POM, HCl, and HF.
Because the above environmental HAP are emitted by at least one facility
in the source category, we proceeded to the second step of the
evaluation.c. PB-HAP Methodology

The environmental screening assessment includes six PB-HAP, arsenic
compounds, cadmium compounds, dioxins/furans, POM, mercury (both
inorganic mercury and methyl mercury), and lead compounds. With the
exception of lead, the environmental risk screening assessment for
PB-HAP consists of three tiers. The first tier of the environmental risk
screening assessment uses the same health-protective conceptual model
that is used for the Tier 1 human health screening assessment. TRIM.FaTE
model simulations were used to back-calculate Tier 1 screening threshold
emission rates. The screening threshold emission rates represent the
emission rate in tons of pollutant per year that results in media
concentrations at the facility that equal the relevant ecological
benchmark. To assess emissions from each facility in the category, the
reported emission rate for each PB-HAP was compared to the Tier 1
screening threshold emission rate for that PB-HAP for each assessment
endpoint and effect level. If emissions from a facility do not exceed
the Tier 1 screening threshold emission rate, the facility “passes” the
screening assessment, and, therefore, is not evaluated further under the
screening approach. If emissions from a facility exceed the Tier 1
screening threshold emission rate, the EPA evaluates the facility
further in Tier 2.

In Tier 2 of the environmental screening assessment, the screening
threshold emission rates are adjusted to account for local meteorology
and the actual location of lakes in the vicinity of facilities that did
not pass the Tier 1 screening assessment. For soils, the EPA evaluates
the average soil concentration for all soil parcels within a 7.5-km
radius for each facility and PB-HAP. For the water, sediment, and fish
tissue concentrations, the highest value for each facility for each
pollutant is used. If emission concentrations from a facility do not
exceed the Tier 2 screening threshold emission rate, the facility
“passes” the screening assessment and typically is not evaluated
further. If emissions from a facility exceed the Tier 2 screening
threshold emission rate, the EPA evaluates the facility further in Tier
3.

As in the multipathway human health risk assessment, in Tier 3 of the
environmental screening assessment, the EPA examines the suitability of
the lakes around the facilities to support life and remove those that
are not suitable (e.g , lakes that have been filled in or are industrial
ponds), adjust emissions for plume-rise, and conduct hour-by-hour
time-series assessments. If these Tier 3 adjustments to the screening
threshold emission rates still indicate the potential for an adverse
environmental effect (i.e , facility emission rate exceeds the screening
threshold emission rate), the EPA may elect to conduct a more refined
assessment using more site-specific information. If, after additional
refinement, the facility emission rate still exceeds the screening
threshold emission rate, the facility may have the potential to cause an
adverse environmental effect.

To evaluate the potential for an adverse environmental effect from lead,
the EPA compared the average modeled air concentrations (from HEM-3) of
lead around each facility in the source category to the level of the
secondary NAAQS for lead. The secondary lead NAAQS is a reasonable means
of evaluating environmental risk because it is set to provide
substantial protection against adverse welfare effects which can include
“effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, man-made materials,
animals, wildlife, weather, visibility and climate, damage to and
deterioration of property, and hazards to transportation, as well as
effects on economic values and on personal comfort and well-being.”d.
Acid Gas Environmental Risk Methodology

The environmental screening assessment for acid gases evaluates the
potential phytotoxicity and reduced productivity of plants due to
chronic exposure to HF and HCl. The environmental risk screening
methodology for acid gases is a single-tier screening assessment that
compares modeled ambient air concentrations (from AERMOD) to the
ecological benchmarks for each acid gas. To identify a potential adverse
environmental effect (as defined in section 112(a)(7) of the CAA) from
emissions of HF and HCl, the EPA evaluates the following metrics: The
size of the modeled area around each facility that exceeds the
ecological benchmark for each acid gas, in acres and km 2; the
percentage of the modeled area around each facility that exceeds the
ecological benchmark for each acid gas; and the area-weighted average
screening value around each facility (calculated by dividing the
area-weighted average concentration over the 50-km modeling domain by
the ecological benchmark for each acid gas). For further information on
the environmental screening assessment approach, see Appendix 9 of the
Residual Risk Assessment for the Plywood and Composite Wood Products
Source Category in Support of the 2019 Risk and Technology Review
Proposed Rule, which is available in the docket for this action.6. How
do we conduct facility-wide assessments?

To put the source category risks in context, the EPA typically examines
the risks from the entire “facility,” where the facility includes all
HAP-emitting operations within a contiguous area and under common
control. In other words, the EPA examines the HAP emissions not only
from the source category emission points of interest, but also emissions
of HAP from all other emission sources at the facility for which the EPA
has data. For this source category, the EPA conducted the facility-wide
assessment using a dataset compiled from the 2014 NEI. The source
category records of that NEI dataset were removed and replaced with the
quality-assured ICR source category dataset described in the memorandum
titled Preparation of the Residual Risk Modeling Input File for the PCWP
NESHAP, in the docket for this rulemaking. This ICR source category
dataset was then combined with the non-source category records from the
NEI for that facility. The combined facility-wide file was then used to
analyze risks due to the inhalation of HAP that are emitted
“facility-wide” for the populations residing within 50 km of each
facility, consistent with the methods used for the source category
analysis described above. For these facility-wide risk analyses, the
modeled source category risks were compared to the facility-wide risks
to determine the portion of the facility-wide risks that could be
attributed to the source category addressed in this proposal. The EPA
also specifically examined the facility that was associated with the
highest estimate of risk and determined the percentage of that risk
attributable to the source category of interest. The Residual Risk
Assessment for the Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category
in Support of the 2019 Risk and Technology Review Proposed Rule,
available through the docket for this action, provides the methodology
and results of the facility-wide analyses, including all facility-wide
risks and the percentage of source category contribution to
facility-wide risks.7. How do we consider uncertainties in risk
assessment?

Uncertainty and the potential for bias are inherent in all risk
assessments, including those performed for this proposal. Although
uncertainty exists, we believe that our approach, which used
conservative tools and assumptions, ensures that our decisions are
health and environmentally protective. A brief discussion of the
uncertainties in the RTR emissions dataset, dispersion modeling,
inhalation exposure estimates, and dose-response relationships follows
below. Also included are those uncertainties specific to acute screening
assessments, multipathway screening assessments, and our environmental
risk screening assessments. A more thorough discussion of these
uncertainties is included in the Residual Risk Assessment for the
Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category in Support of the
2019 Risk and Technology Review Proposed Rule, which is available in the
docket for this action. If a multipathway site-specific assessment was
performed for this source category, a full discussion of the
uncertainties associated with that assessment can be found in Appendix
11 of that document, Site-Specific Human Health Multipathway Residual
Risk Assessment Report.a. Uncertainties in the RTR Emissions Dataset

Although the development of the RTR emissions dataset involved quality
assurance/quality control processes, the accuracy of emissions values
will vary depending on the source of the data, the degree to which data
are incomplete or missing, the degree to which assumptions made to
complete the datasets are accurate, errors in emission estimates, and
other factors. For example, older emission factors that do not account
for relatively recent reductions in resin formaldehyde content may have
been used by some PCWP mills to estimate emissions from uncontrolled
process units that are hard to test, resulting in overestimation of
formaldehyde emissions. The emission estimates considered in this
analysis generally are annual totals for certain years, and they do not
reflect short-term fluctuations during the course of a year or
variations from year to year. For facilities with missing or invalid
short-term emission estimates in their PCWP ICR data, the estimates of
maximum hourly emission rates for the acute effects screening assessment
were based on an emission adjustment factor applied to the average
annual hourly emission rates, which are intended to account for emission
fluctuations due to normal facility operations.b. Uncertainties in
Dispersion Modeling

The EPA recognizes there is uncertainty in ambient concentration
estimates associated with any model, including the EPA's recommended
regulatory dispersion model, AERMOD. In using a model to estimate
ambient pollutant concentrations, the user chooses certain options to
apply. For RTR assessments, the EPA selects some model options that have
the potential to overestimate ambient air concentrations (e.g , not
including plume depletion or pollutant transformation). The EPA selects
other model options that have the potential to underestimate ambient
impacts (e.g , not including building downwash). Other options that the
EPA selects have the potential to either under- or overestimate ambient
levels (e.g , meteorology and receptor locations). On balance,
considering the directional nature of the uncertainties commonly present
in ambient concentrations estimated by dispersion models, the approach
the EPA applies in the RTR assessments should yield unbiased estimates
of ambient HAP concentrations. After reviewing the physical
characteristics of emission releases from batch and continuous lumber
kilns, dispersion and risk modelers at the EPA recommend the buoyant
plume rise resulting from the elevated temperature of kiln exhaust be
taken into account when modeling kiln fugitive emissions to improve
accuracy. Appendix 12 of the document, Residual Risk Assessment for the
Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category in Support of the
2019 Risk and Technology Review Proposed Rule, in the docket for this
rulemaking describes the methodology and results. We also note that the
selection of meteorology dataset location could have an impact on the
risk estimates. As the EPA continues to update and expand the library of
meteorological station data used in our risk assessments, we expect to
reduce this variability.c. Uncertainties in Inhalation Exposure
Assessment

Although every effort is made to identify all of the relevant facilities
and emission points, as well as to develop accurate estimates of the
annual emission rates for all relevant HAP, the uncertainties in the
EPA's emission inventory likely dominate the uncertainties in the
exposure assessment. Some uncertainties in our exposure assessment
include human mobility, using the centroid of each census block,
assuming lifetime exposure, and assuming only outdoor exposures. For
most of these factors, there is neither an under nor overestimate when
looking at the maximum individual risk or the incidence, but the shape
of the distribution of risks may be affected. With respect to outdoor
exposures, actual exposures may not be as high if people spend time
indoors, especially for very reactive pollutants or larger particles.
For all factors, the EPA reduces uncertainty when possible. For example,
with respect to census-block centroids, the EPA analyzes large blocks
using aerial imagery and adjust locations of the block centroids to
better represent the population in the blocks. The EPA also adds
additional receptor locations where the population of a block is not
well represented by a single location.d. Uncertainties in Dose-Response
Relationships

There are uncertainties inherent in the development of the dose-response
values used in the EPA's risk assessments for cancer effects from
chronic exposures and noncancer effects from both chronic and acute
exposures. Some uncertainties are generally expressed quantitatively,
and others are generally expressed in qualitative terms. We note, as a
preface to this discussion, a point on dose-response uncertainty that is
stated in the EPA's 2005 Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment;
namely, that “the primary goal of EPA actions is protection of human
health; accordingly, as an Agency policy, risk assessment procedures,
including default options that are used in the absence of scientific
data to the contrary, should be health protective” (the EPA's 2005
Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, page 1-7). This is the
approach followed here as summarized in the next paragraphs.

Cancer UREs used in the EPA's risk assessments are those that have been
developed to generally provide an upper bound estimate of risk. (19)
That is, they represent a “plausible upper limit to the true value of a
quantity” (although this is usually not a true statistical confidence
limit). In some circumstances, the true risk could be as low as zero;
however, in other circumstances the risk could be greater. (20) Chronic
noncancer RfC and reference dose (RfD) values represent chronic exposure
levels that are intended to be health-protective levels. To derive
dose-response values that are intended to be “without appreciable risk,”
the methodology relies upon an uncertainty factor (UF) approach, (21)
which considers uncertainty, variability, and gaps in the available
data. The UFs are applied to derive dose-response values that are
intended to protect against appreciable risk of deleterious effects.

Many of the UFs used to account for variability and uncertainty in the
development of acute dose-response values are quite similar to those
developed for chronic durations. Additional adjustments are often
applied to account for uncertainty in extrapolation from observations at
one exposure duration (e.g , 4 hours) to derive an acute dose-response
value at another exposure duration (e.g , 1 hour). Not all acute
dose-response values are developed for the same purpose, and care must
be taken when interpreting the results of an acute assessment of human
health effects relative to the dose-response value or values being
exceeded. Where relevant to the estimated exposures, the lack of acute
dose-response values at different levels of severity should be factored
into the risk characterization as potential uncertainties.

Uncertainty also exists in the selection of ecological benchmarks for
the environmental risk screening assessment. The EPA established a
hierarchy of preferred benchmark sources to allow selection of
benchmarks for each environmental HAP at each ecological assessment
endpoint. We searched for benchmarks for three effect levels (i.e ,
no-effects level, threshold-effect level, and probable effect level),
but not all combinations of ecological assessment/environmental HAP had
benchmarks for all three effect levels. Where multiple effect levels
were available for a particular HAP and assessment endpoint, we used all
of the available effect levels to help us determine whether risk exists
and whether the risk could be considered significant and widespread.

Although the EPA makes every effort to identify appropriate human health
effect dose-response values for all pollutants emitted by the sources in
this risk assessment, some HAP emitted by this source category are
lacking dose-response assessments. Accordingly, these pollutants cannot
be included in the quantitative risk assessment, which could result in
quantitative estimates understating HAP risk. To help to alleviate this
potential underestimate, where the EPA concludes similarity with a HAP
for which a dose-response value is available, we use that value as a
surrogate for the assessment of the HAP for which no value is available.
To the extent use of surrogates indicates appreciable risk, the EPA may
identify a need to increase priority for an IRIS assessment for that
substance. We additionally note that, generally speaking, HAP of
greatest concern due to environmental exposures and hazard are those for
which dose-response assessments have been performed, reducing the
likelihood of understating risk. Further, HAP not included in the
quantitative assessment are assessed qualitatively and considered in the
risk characterization that informs the risk management decisions,
including consideration of HAP reductions achieved by various control
options.

For a group of compounds that are unspeciated (e.g , glycol ethers), the
EPA conservatively uses the most protective dose-response value of an
individual compound in that group to estimate risk. Similarly, for an
individual compound in a group (e.g , ethylene glycol diethyl ether)
that does not have a specified dose-response value, the EPA also applies
the most protective dose-response value from the other compounds in the
group to estimate risk.e. Uncertainties in Acute Inhalation Screening
Assessments

In addition to the uncertainties highlighted above, there are several
factors specific to the acute exposure assessment that the EPA conducts
as part of the risk review under section 112 of the CAA. The accuracy of
an acute inhalation exposure assessment depends on the simultaneous
occurrence of independent factors that may vary greatly, such as hourly
emission rates, meteorology, and the presence of a person. In the acute
screening assessment that the EPA conducts under the RTR program, we
assume that peak emissions from the source category and reasonable
worst-case air dispersion conditions (i.e , 99th percentile) co-occur.
The EPA then includes the additional assumption that a person is located
at this point at the same time. Together, these assumptions represent a
reasonable worst-case exposure scenario. In most cases, it is unlikely
that a person would be located at the point of maximum exposure during
the time when peak emissions and reasonable worst-case air dispersion
conditions occur simultaneously.f. Uncertainties in the Multipathway and
Environmental Risk Screening Assessments

For each source category, the EPA generally relies on site-specific
levels of PB-HAP or environmental HAP emissions to determine whether a
refined assessment of the impacts from multipathway exposures is
necessary or whether it is necessary to perform an environmental
screening assessment. This determination is based on the results of a
three-tiered screening assessment that relies on the outputs from
models—TRIM.FaTE and AERMOD—that estimate environmental pollutant
concentrations and human exposures for five PB-HAP (dioxins, POM,
mercury, cadmium, and arsenic) and two acid gases (HF and HCl). For
lead, the EPA uses AERMOD to determine ambient air concentrations, which
are then compared to the secondary NAAQS standard for lead. Two
important types of uncertainty associated with the use of these models
in RTR risk assessments and inherent to any assessment that relies on
environmental modeling are model uncertainty and input uncertainty. (22)

Model uncertainty concerns whether the model adequately represents the
actual processes (e.g , movement and accumulation) that might occur in
the environment. For example, does the model adequately describe the
movement of a pollutant through the soil? This type of uncertainty is
difficult to quantify. However, based on feedback received from previous
EPA SAB reviews and other reviews, we are confident that the models used
in the screening assessments are appropriate and state-of-the-art for
the multipathway and environmental screening risk assessments conducted
in support of RTR.

Input uncertainty is concerned with how accurately the models have been
configured and parameterized for the assessment at hand. For Tier 1 of
the multipathway and environmental screening assessments, the EPA
configured the models to avoid underestimating exposure and risk. This
was accomplished by selecting upper-end values from nationally
representative datasets for the more influential parameters in the
environmental model, including selection and spatial configuration of
the area of interest, lake location and size, meteorology, surface
water, soil characteristics, and structure of the aquatic food web. The
EPA also assumes an ingestion exposure scenario and values for human
exposure factors that represent reasonable maximum exposures.

In Tier 2 of the multipathway and environmental screening assessments,
the EPA refines the model inputs to account for meteorological patterns
in the vicinity of the facility versus using upper-end national values
and identifies the actual location of lakes near the facility rather
than the default lake location applied in Tier 1. By refining the
screening approach in Tier 2 to account for local geographical and
meteorological data, the EPA decreases the likelihood that
concentrations in environmental media are overestimated, thereby
increasing the usefulness of the screening assessment. In Tier 3 of the
screening assessments, the EPA refines the model inputs again to account
for hour-by-hour plume rise and the height of the mixing layer. The EPA
can also use those hour-by-hour meteorological data in a TRIM.FaTE run
using the screening configuration corresponding to the lake location.
These refinements produce a more accurate estimate of chemical
concentrations in the media of interest, thereby reducing the
uncertainty with those estimates. The assumptions and the associated
uncertainties regarding the selected ingestion exposure scenario are the
same for all three tiers.

For the environmental screening assessment for acid gases, the EPA
employs a single-tiered approach. The EPA uses the modeled air
concentrations and compare those with ecological benchmarks.

For all tiers of the multipathway and environmental screening
assessments, the EPA's approach to addressing model input uncertainty is
generally cautious. The EPA chooses model inputs from the upper end of
the range of possible values for the influential parameters used in the
models, and assumes that the exposed individual exhibits ingestion
behavior that would lead to a high total exposure. This approach reduces
the likelihood of not identifying high risks for adverse impacts.

Despite the uncertainties, when individual pollutants or facilities do
not exceed screening threshold emission rates (i.e , screen out), the
EPA is confident that the potential for adverse multipathway impacts on
human health is very low. On the other hand, when individual pollutants
or facilities do exceed screening threshold emission rates, it does not
mean that impacts are significant, only that the EPA cannot rule out
that possibility and that a refined assessment for the site might be
necessary to obtain a more accurate risk characterization for the source
category.

The EPA evaluates the following HAP in the multipathway and/or
environmental risk screening assessments, where applicable: Arsenic,
cadmium, dioxins/furans, lead, mercury (both inorganic and methyl
mercury), POM, HCl, and HF. These HAP represent pollutants that can
cause adverse impacts either through direct exposure to HAP in the air
or through exposure to HAP that are deposited from the air onto soils
and surface waters and then through the environment into the food web.
These HAP represent those HAP for which the EPA can conduct a meaningful
multipathway or environmental screening risk assessment. For other HAP
not included in our screening assessments, the model has not been
parameterized such that it can be used for that purpose. In some cases,
depending on the HAP, the EPA may not have appropriate multipathway
models that allow us to predict the concentration of that pollutant. The
EPA acknowledges that other HAP beyond these that we are evaluating may
have the potential to cause adverse effects and, therefore, the EPA may
evaluate other relevant HAP in the future, as modeling science and
resources allow.IV. Analytical Results and Proposed DecisionsA. What are
the results of the risk assessment and analyses?1. Chronic Inhalation
Risk Assessment Results

Table 2 of this preamble provides an overall summary of the inhalation
risk results. The results of the chronic baseline inhalation cancer risk
assessment indicate that, based on estimates of current actual and
allowable emissions, the MIR posed by the PCWP source category was
estimated to be 30-in-1 million. The risk driver is chiefly formaldehyde
emissions from batch and continuous lumber kilns. The total estimated
cancer incidence based on actual and allowable emission levels from all
PCWP emission sources is 0.03 excess cancer cases per year, or one case
in every 33 years, with emissions from the lumber kilns representing 43
percent of the modeled cancer incidence in the source category.
Emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and chromium VI compounds
contributed 93 percent to this cancer incidence with formaldehyde being
the largest contributor (76 percent of the incidence). Based upon actual
emissions from the source category, approximately 200,000 people were
exposed to cancer risks above or equal to 1-in-1 million.

The maximum chronic noncancer HI (TOSHI) values based on actual and
allowable emissions for the source category were estimated to be less
than 1. Based upon actual emissions from the source category,
respiratory risks were driven by acrolein, acetaldehyde, and
formaldehyde emissions from batch lumber kilns. Based upon allowable
emissions from the source category, the respiratory risk was driven by
methylene diphenyl diisocyanate emissions from a miscellaneous coating
operation and formaldehyde emissions from lumber kilns.Table 2—Plywood

Acute Risk Assessment Results

Worst-case acute HQs were calculated for every HAP for which there is an
acute health benchmark using actual emissions. The maximum refined
off-site acute noncancer HQ values for the source category were equal to
4 from acrolein emissions and 2 from formaldehyde emissions (based on
the acute (1-hr) REL for these pollutants). The acrolein and
formaldehyde maximum HQ values were at separate facilities. No other
acute health benchmarks were exceeded for this source category. The
acute risk driver for acrolein was primarily from continuous lumber
kilns and the MIR location for acute formaldehyde risks were from batch
lumber kilns. The continuous and batch lumber kilns were modeled with
hourly emissions ranging from 2 to 8 times the annual average hourly
emissions rate. Acute HQs are not calculated for allowable or whole
facility emissions.3. Multipathway Risk Screening Results

Results of the worst-case Tier 1 screening analysis indicate that PB-HAP
emissions (based on estimates of actual emissions) emitted from the
source category exceeded the screening values for the carcinogenic
PB-HAP (arsenic, dioxin/furan, and POM compounds) and for the
noncarcinogenic PB-HAP (cadmium and mercury) based upon emissions from
48 facilities reporting carcinogenic PB-HAP and 19 facilities reporting
non-carcinogenic PB-HAP in the source category. For the PB-HAP and
facilities that did not screen out at Tier 1, the EPA conducted a Tier 2
screening analysis.

The Tier 2 screen replaces some of the assumptions used in Tier 1 with
site-specific data, the location of fishable lakes, and local wind
direction and speed. The Tier 2 screen continues to rely on high-end
assumptions about consumption of local fish and locally grown or raised
foods (adult female angler at 99th percentile consumption for fish (23)
for the fisher scenario and 90th percentile for consumption of locally
raised livestock and grown produce (vegetables and fruits) (24) ) for
the farmer scenario and uses an assumption that the same individual
consumes each of these foods in high end quantities (i.e , that an
individual has high end ingestion rates for each food). The result of
this analysis was the development of site-specific concentrations of
dioxin/furan, POM compounds, arsenic compounds, cadmium and mercury
compounds. It is important to note that, even with the inclusion of some
site-specific information in the Tier 2 analysis, the multipathway
screening analysis is a still a very conservative, health-protective
assessment (e.g , upper-bound consumption of local fish, locally grown,
and/or raised foods) and in all likelihood will yield results that serve
as an upper-bound multipathway risk associated with a facility.

Based on this upper-bound Tier 2 screening assessment for carcinogens,
the dioxin/furan and POM emission rates for all facilities and scenarios
were below levels of concern. Arsenic emissions exceeded the screening
value by a factor of 70 for the farmer scenario, a factor of 40 for the
gardener scenario, and a factor of 6 for the fisher scenario. The Tier 2
gardener scenario is based upon the same ingestion rate of produce as
the farmer for a rural environment. No additional refined screens or
site-specific assessments were conducted for emissions of arsenic based
upon the conservative nature of the Tier 2 screen and because the
screening value was below the level of acceptability of 100-in-1
million. For the non-carcinogens, emissions of cadmium were below an HQ
of 1 for the Tier 2 fisher scenario. For mercury, three facilities
exceeded the Tier 2 multipathway screening values of 1 by a factor of 2
based upon aggregate lake impacts by facilities within the source
category for the fisher scenario.

For mercury, the EPA conducted a Tier 3 multipathway screen for two
facilities which included two of the three individual stages. These
stages included a lake assessment for fishability and the mass lost due
to plume rise, a time-series assessment was not conducted. A lake and
plume rise assessment was conducted resulting in a maximum Tier 3
screening value of 2, a 20-percent reduction in their Tier 2 screening
value was achieved due to plume rise. A screening value in any of the
tiers is not an estimate of the cancer risk or a noncancer HQ (or HI).
Rather, a screening value represents a high-end estimate of what the
risk or hazard may be. For example, facility emissions resulting in a
screening value of 2 for a non-carcinogen can be interpreted to mean
that we are confident that the HQ would be lower than 2. Similarly,
facility emissions resulting in a cancer screening value of 40 for a
carcinogen means that we are confident that the cancer risk is lower
than 40-in-1 million. Our confidence comes from the health-protective
assumptions that are incorporated into the screens: We choose inputs
from the upper end of the range of possible values for the influential
parameters used in the screens; and we assume food consumption behaviors
that would lead to high total exposure. This risk assessment estimates
the maximum hazard for mercury through fish consumption based on upper
bound screens and the maximum excess cancer risks from dioxins/furans
and arsenic through ingestion of fish and farm produce.

When we progress from the model designs of the Tier 1, 2, and 3 screens
to a site-specific assessment, we refine the risk assessment through
incorporation of additional site-specific data and enhanced model
designs. Site-specific refinements include the following; (1) improved
spatial locations identifying the boundaries of the watershed and lakes
within the watershed as it relates to surrounding facilities within the
source category; (2) calculating actual soil/water run-off amounts to
target lakes based upon actual soil type(s) and elevation changes
associated with the affected watershed versus assuming a worst-case
assumption of 100-percent run-off to target lakes; and (3) incorporating
AERMOD deposition of pollutants into TRIM.FaTE to accurately account for
site-specific release parameters such as stack heights and exit gas
temperatures, versus using TRIMFaTE's simple dispersion algorithms that
assume the pollutant is uniformly distributed within the airshed. These
refinements have the net effect of improved modeling of the mass of HAP
entering a lake by more accurately defining the watershed/lake
boundaries as well as the dispersion of HAP into the atmosphere to
better reflect deposition contours across all target watersheds and
lakes in our 50 km model domain.

The maximum mercury Tier 2 noncancer screening value for this source
category is 2 with subsequent refinement resulting in a Tier 3 screening
value of 2. No additional refinements to the Tier 3 screen value of 2
were conducted by the EPA. Risk results from four site-specific mercury
assessments the EPA has conducted for four RTR source categories
resulted in noncancer HQs that range from 50 to 800 times lower than the
respective Tier 2 screening value for these facilities (refer to EPA
Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243 for a copy of these reports). (25) Based
on our review of these analyses, we would expect at least a one order of
magnitude decrease in all Tier 2 noncancer screening values for mercury
for the PCWP source category, if we were to perform a site-specific
assessment. In addition, based upon the conservative nature of the
screens and the level of additional refinements that would go into a
site-specific multipathway assessment, were one to be conducted, we are
confident that the HI for ingestion exposure, specifically mercury
through fish ingestion, is less than 1.

Further details on the Tier 3 screening assessment can be found in
Appendix 11 of Residual Risk Assessment for the Plywood Composite and
Wood Products Source Category in Support of the 2019 Risk and Technology
Review Proposed Rule, in the docket for this action.

In evaluating the potential for multipathway effects from emissions of
lead, the EPA compared modeled annual lead concentrations to the primary
NAAQS level for lead (0.15 μg/m 3, arithmetic mean concentration over a
3-month period. The highest annual average lead concentration of 0.013
µg/m 3 is below the NAAQS level for lead, indicating a low potential for
multipathway impacts.4. Environmental Risk Screening Results

The EPA conducted an environmental risk screening assessment for the
PCWP source category for the following pollutants: Arsenic, cadmium,
dioxins/furans, HCl, HF, lead, mercury (methyl mercury and mercuric
chloride), and POM.

In the Tier 1 screening analysis for PB-HAP (other than lead, which was
evaluated differently), arsenic, cadmium, dioxins/furans, and POM
emissions had no Tier 1 exceedances for any ecological benchmark.
Divalent mercury emissions at nine facilities had Tier 1 exceedances for
the surface soil threshold levels (invertebrate and plant communities)
by a maximum screening value of 5. Methyl mercury emissions at 13
facilities had Tier 1 exceedances for the surface soil NOAEL (avian
ground insectivores) by a maximum screening value of 7.

A Tier 2 screening assessment was performed for divalent mercury and
methyl mercury. Divalent mercury and methyl mercury had no Tier 2
exceedances for any ecological benchmark. For lead, the EPA did not
estimate any exceedances of the secondary lead NAAQS. For HCl and HF,
the average modeled concentration around each facility (i.e , the
average concentration of all off-site data points in the modeling
domain) did not exceed any ecological benchmark. In addition, each
individual modeled concentration of HCl and HF (i.e , each off-site data
point in the modeling domain) was below the ecological benchmarks for
all facilities. Based on the results of the environmental risk screening
analysis, the EPA does not expect an adverse environmental effect as a
result of HAP emissions from this source category.5. Facility-Wide Risk
Results

Results of the assessment of facility-wide emissions indicate that of
the 233 facilities, 182 facilities have a facility-wide MIR cancer risk
greater than 1-in-1 million. The maximum facility-wide cancer risk is
30-in-1 million, mainly driven by formaldehyde emissions from batch and
continuous lumber kilns. The total estimated cancer incidence from the
whole facility is 0.04 excess cancer cases per year, or one case in
every 25 years. Approximately 260,000 people are estimated to have
cancer risks greater than 1-in-1 million. The maximum facility-wide
chronic noncancer TOSHI is estimated to be equal to 1, driven by
emissions of acrolein, chlorine, and HCl from non-category sources.6.
What demographic groups might benefit from this regulation?

To examine the potential for any environmental justice issues that might
be associated with the source category, the EPA performed a demographic
analysis, which is an assessment of risk to individual demographic
groups of the populations living within 5 km and within 50 km of the
facilities. In the analysis, the EPA evaluated the distribution of
HAP-related cancer and noncancer risk from the PCWP source category
across different demographic groups within the populations living near
facilities.

The results of the demographic analysis are summarized in Table 3 below.
These results, for various demographic groups, are based on the
estimated risk from actual emissions levels for the population living
within 50 km of the facilities.Table 3—Plywood and Composite Wood

The results of the PCWP source category demographic analysis indicate
that emissions from the source category expose approximately 200,000
people to a cancer risk at or above 1-in-1 million and zero people to a
chronic noncancer TOSHI greater than 1. The percentages of the at-risk
population in four of the eleven demographic groups (African American,
Native American, below poverty level, and over 25 without a high school
diploma) are greater than their respective nationwide percentages.

The methodology and the results of the demographic analysis are
presented in a technical report, Risk and Technology Review—Analysis of
Demographic Factors for Populations Living Near Plywood and Composite
Wood Products Source Category, available in the docket for this
action.B. What are our proposed decisions regarding risk acceptability,
ample margin of safety, and adverse environmental effect?1. Risk
Acceptability

As noted in section II.A of this preamble, the EPA sets standards under
CAA section 112(f)(2) using “a two-step standard-setting approach, with
an analytical first step to determine an 'acceptable risk' that
considers all health information, including risk estimation uncertainty,
and includes a presumptive limit on MIR of approximately 1-in-10
thousand.” (54 FR 38045, September 14, 1989).

In this proposal, the EPA estimated risks based on actual and allowable
emissions from the PCWP source category. In determining whether risks
are acceptable, the EPA considered all available health information and
risk estimation uncertainty, as described above. Table 2 summarizes the
risk assessment results for the source category. The results for the
PCWP source category indicate that both the actual and allowable
inhalation cancer risks to the individual most exposed are below the
presumptive limit of acceptability of 100-in-1 million (see discussion
of presumptive risk in background section II.A). The residual risk
assessment for the PCWP category (26) estimated cancer incidence rate at
0.03 cases per year based on both source category actual and allowable
emissions. The low number for the predicted cancer incidence is, in part
due to the rural location of many PCWP facilities. The population
estimate of 204,000 people exposed to a cancer risk equal to or above
1-in-1 million from source category actual emissions from 170 facilities
reflects the rural nature of the source category. Another factor in the
low incidence number is that the estimate of people exposed to a cancer
risk greater than 10-in-1 million from source category actual emissions
drops to 650 people.

The maximum chronic noncancer TOSHI due to inhalation exposures is less
than 1 for actual and allowable emissions from the source category. The
results of the acute screening analysis showed maximum acute HQs of 4
for acrolein and 2 for formaldehyde emissions. The EPA is proposing to
find the acute risks acceptable for the source category considering the
conservative assumptions used that err on the side of overestimating
acute risk (as discussed in section III.C.7.e).

Maximum cancer risk due to ingestion exposures estimated using
health-protective risk screening assumptions are below 6-in-1 million
for the Tier 2 fisher scenario and below 40-in-1 million for the Tier 2
rural gardener exposure scenario. While the Tier 3 screening analyses of
mercury exposure due to fish ingestion determined that the maximum HQ
for mercury would be less than 2, the EPA is confident that this
estimate would be reduced if further refined to incorporate enhanced
site-specific analyses such as improved model boundary identification
with refined soil/water run-off calculations and use of AERMOD
deposition outputs in the TRIM.FaTE model. Considering all of the health
risk information and factors discussed above, as well as the
uncertainties discussed in section III of this preamble, we propose that
the risks posed by emissions from the PCWP source category are
acceptable after implementation of the existing MACT standards.2. Ample
Margin of Safety Analysis

As directed by CAA section 112(f)(2), the EPA conducted an analysis to
determine if the current emissions standards provide an ample margin of
safety to protect public health. Under the ample margin of safety
analysis, the EPA considers all health factors evaluated in the risk
assessment and evaluates the cost and feasibility of available control
technologies and other measures (including the controls, measures, and
costs reviewed under the technology review) that could be applied to
this source category to further reduce the risks (or potential risks)
due to emissions of HAP identified in our risk assessment. Although the
EPA is proposing that the risks from this source category are acceptable
for both inhalation and multipathway, risk estimates for approximately
200,000 people in the exposed population surrounding 170 facilities
producing PCWP or kiln-dried lumber are equal to or above 1-in-1
million, caused primarily by formaldehyde emissions. The EPA considered
whether the PCWP MACT standards provide an ample margin of safety to
protect public health. The EPA did not identify methods for further
reducing HAP emissions from the PCWP source category that would achieve
meaningful risk reductions for purposes of the ample margin of safety
analysis. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that the current PCWP
standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health and
revision of the promulgated standards is not required.3. Adverse
Environmental Effect

The EPA does not expect there to be an adverse environmental effect as a
result of HAP emissions from this source category and we are proposing
that it is not necessary to set a more stringent standard to prevent,
taking into consideration costs, energy, safety, and other relevant
factors, an adverse environmental effect.C. What are the results and
proposed decisions based on the EPA's technology review?

As described in section III.B of this preamble, the EPA's technology
review focused on identifying developments in practices, processes, and
control technologies for process units subject to standards under the
NESHAP that have occurred since 2004 when emission standards were
promulgated for the PCWP source category. The EPA reviewed ICR responses
and other available information (described in sections II.C and II.D of
this preamble) to conduct the technology review. The following process
units were included in our review: Green rotary dryers, hardboard ovens,
pressurized refiners, primary tube dryers, reconstituted wood product
presses, softwood veneer dryer heated zones, rotary strand dryers,
secondary tube dryers, conveyor strand dryers, fiberboard mat dryers,
press predryers, and reconstituted wood product board coolers. The
technological basis for the promulgated PCWP NESHAP was use of
incineration-based or biofilter add-on controls to reduce HAP emissions.
Incineration-based controls include regenerative thermal oxidizers
(RTOs), regenerative catalytic oxidizers (RCOs), and incineration of
process exhaust in an onsite combustion unit (referred to as “process
incineration”). In addition to the add-on control device compliance
options in Table 1B to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, Table 1A to 40 CFR
part 63, subpart DDDD contains production-based compliance options
(PBCO) for process units with low emissions due to pollution prevention
measures inherent in their process (e.g , low-formaldehyde resins). An
emissions averaging compliance option is also available for existing
sources in 40 CFR 63.2240(c). One facility demonstrates compliance with
the PCWP NESHAP using emissions averaging because none of the other
compliance options were feasible for controlling the unique operations
at this facility.

Most facilities comply with the PCWP NESHAP using the add-on control
options. The EPA observed in our review that many facilities route
multiple process units of the same or different types into one shared
control system. Facilities use RTOs, RCOs, process incineration, and
biofilter control systems as expected. The numerous different process
unit and control device combinations that are used in the source
category underscore the ongoing utility of the compliance options in
Table 1B to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD. The EPA reviewed emissions
test data for PCWP process units with add-on controls and concluded that
no change in the add-on control emission limits is necessary considering
emissions variability. The incremental cost of increasing the required
HAP control efficiency from 90-to 95-percent reduction was estimated for
new sources to be $670,000 nationwide for a nationwide HAP reduction of
47 tpy ($14,400 per ton of HAP reduced). The EPA is not adopting this
option because it was not clearly supported by the emissions data
reviewed. The emissions data reflected repeat emissions tests with
variability spanning above and below the 95-percent control level,
suggesting that maintaining 95-percent HAP control with some compliance
margin would be unachievable for the variety of process and control
configurations used in the industry. Further, as discussed below, the
HAP inlet concentration of some process units has decreased, making the
90-percent reduction options more challenging to achieve.

Through our review of the ICR data, the EPA found a few facilities
currently use the PBCO. Due to a development in the PCWP source
category, the EPA expects the PBCO could become more widely used as
current add-on air pollution controls for reconstituted wood products
presses reach the end of their useful life. In 2008, after the PCWP
NESHAP was promulgated, the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
finalized an Airborne Toxic Control Measure (ATCM) to reduce
formaldehyde emissions from hardwood plywood, MDF, and particleboard.
Consistent with the CARB ATCM, in July 2010, Congress passed the
Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act, as title VI of
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), [15 U.S.C 2697], requiring the EPA
to promulgate a national rule. The EPA subsequently proposed a rule in
2013 to implement TSCA title VI to reduce formaldehyde emissions from
composite wood products. The TSCA rule (Formaldehyde Emission Standards
for Composite Wood Products, RIN 2070-AJ44) was finalized by the EPA on
December 12, 2016 (81 FR 89674), and an implementation rule was
finalized on February 7, 2018 (83 FR 5340). Compliance with all aspects
of the TSCA rule was required by December 2018. The CARB ATCM and the
rule to implement TSCA title VI emphasize the use of low emission
resins, including ultra-low-emitting formaldehyde and no added
formaldehyde resin systems. As facilities conduct repeat testing, they
may find that the inlet concentration of formaldehyde and methanol from
their pressing operations has dropped if they are now using a different,
lower-HAP resin system to comply with the CARB and TSCA standards. The
decrease in inlet concentration may allow for use of the PBCO without an
add-on control device providing a compliance option in addition to the
current add-on control device compliance option. While the CARB and TSCA
standards are a “development” within the context of CAA section
112(d)(6), these rules do not necessitate revision of the
previously-promulgated PCWP emission standards because the promulgated
PCWP emission standards already include the PBCO provisions for
pollution prevention measures such as lower-HAP resins.

The PCWP NESHAP also contains work practice standards for selected
process units in Table 3 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD; however, the
EPA did not identify any developments in practices, processes, or
controls for these units beyond those identified in the
originally-promulgated PCWP NESHAP. Overall, the EPA's review of the
developments in technology for the process units subject to the PCWP
NESHAP did not reveal any changes that require revisions to the emission
standards. As discussed above, the PCWP rule was promulgated with
multiple options for reducing HAP emissions to demonstrate compliance
with the standard. The EPA found that facilities are using each type of
control system or pollution prevention measure that was anticipated when
the PCWP emissions standards were promulgated. However, the EPA did not
identify any developments in practices, processes, or controls for these
units beyond those identified in the originally-promulgated PCWP NESHAP.
Therefore, the EPA proposes that no revisions to the PCWP NESHAP are
necessary pursuant to CAA section 112(d)(6). Additional details on our
technology review can be found in the memorandum, Technology Review for
the Plywood and Composite Wood Products NESHAP, which is available in
the docket for this action.D. What other actions are we proposing?

In addition to the proposed actions described above, the EPA is
proposing additional revisions to the NESHAP. The EPA is proposing
revisions to the SSM provisions of the MACT rule in order to ensure that
they are consistent with the Court decision in Sierra Club v. EPA, 551
F. 3d 1019 (D.C Cir. 2008), which vacated two provisions that exempted
sources from the requirement to comply with otherwise applicable CAA
section 112(d) emission standards during periods of SSM. The EPA is also
proposing various other changes, including addition of electronic
reporting, addition of a repeat testing requirement, revisions to
parameter monitoring requirements, and other technical and editorial
changes. Our analyses and proposed changes related to these issues are
discussed below.1. SSM

In its 2008 decision in Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019 (D.C Cir.
2008), the Court vacated portions of two provisions in the EPA's CAA
section 112 regulations governing the emissions of HAP during periods of
SSM. Specifically, the Court vacated the SSM exemption contained in 40
CFR 63.6(f)(1) and 40 CFR 63.6(h)(1), holding that under section 302(k)
of the CAA, emissions standards or limitations must be continuous in
nature and that the SSM exemption violates the CAA's requirement that
some section 112 standards apply continuously.

The EPA is proposing the elimination of the SSM exemption in this rule
which appears at 40 CFR 63.2250 Consistent with Sierra Club v. EPA, the
EPA is proposing standards in this rule that apply at all times. The EPA
is also proposing several revisions to Table 10 (the General Provisions
Applicability Table) as is explained in more detail below. For example,
the EPA is proposing to eliminate the incorporation of the General
Provisions' requirement that the source develop an SSM plan. The EPA is
also proposing to eliminate and revise certain recordkeeping and
reporting requirements related to the SSM exemption as further described
below. As discussed in section IV.E of this preamble, facilities will
have 6 months (180 days) after the effective date of the final rule to
transition from use of the SSM exemption to compliance without the
exemption beginning on the 181st day after the effective date of the
amendments. A 5th column to Table 10 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD was
added to clearly indicate which requirements apply before, and then on
and after the date 181 days after the effective date. See section IV.E
for more discussion of the compliance date.

The EPA has attempted to ensure that the provisions we are proposing to
eliminate are inappropriate, unnecessary, or redundant in the absence of
the SSM exemption. The EPA is specifically seeking comment on whether we
have successfully done so.

In proposing the standards in this rule, the EPA has taken into account
startup and shutdown periods and, for the reasons explained below, has
proposed alternate standards for specific periods. The EPA collected
information with the PCWP ICR to use in determining whether applying the
standards applicable under normal operations would be problematic for
PCWP facilities during startup and shutdown. Based on the information
collected, facilities can meet the PCWP compliance options, operating
requirements, and work practices at all times with two exceptions during
periods of startup and shutdown (discussed further below). Facilities
operating control systems generally operate the control systems while
the process unit(s) controlled are started up and shutdown. For example,
RTOs and RCOs are warmed to their operating temperature set points using
auxiliary fuel before the process unit(s) controlled startup and the
oxidizers continue to maintain their temperature until the process
unit(s) controlled shutdown. Biofilters operate within a biofilter bed
temperature range that will be more easily achieved during startup and
shutdown with changes in biofilter bed temperature operating range
discussed in section IV.D

The two situations where standards for normal operation cannot be met
during startup and shutdown are during safety-related shutdowns and
pressurized refiner startups and shutdowns. The EPA is proposing work
practice standards in Table 3 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD to apply
during these times to ensure that a CAA section 112 standard applies
continuously. Work practices are appropriate during safety-related
shutdowns and pressurized refiner startup/shutdown because it is not
technically feasible to capture and route emissions to a control device
during these periods, nor is it technically or economically feasible to
measure emissions during the brief periods when these situations occur
(i.e , less than the 1-hour test runs or 3 hours required for a full
test). It is particularly infeasible to measure emissions from
safety-related shutdowns because these shutdowns are unplanned.

Safety-related shutdowns differ from routine shutdowns that allow
facilities to continue routing process unit emissions to the control
device until the process unit is shut down. Safety-related shutdowns
occur often enough that they are also distinguished from malfunctions
which are, by definition, infrequent. In addition, the PCWP process
shuts down when these events are triggered. Safety-related shutdowns
must occur rapidly in the event of unsafe conditions such as a suspected
fire in a process unit heating flammable wood material. When unsafe
conditions are detected, facilities must act quickly to shut off fuel
flow (or indirect process heat) to the system, cease addition of raw
materials (e.g , wood furnish, resin) to the process units, purge wood
material and gases from the process unit, and isolate equipment to
prevent loss of property or life and protect workers from injury.
Because it is unsafe to continue to route process gases to the control
system, the control system will be bypassed, in many cases automatically
through a system of interlocks designed to prevent dangerous conditions
from occurring. The EPA is proposing to define “safety-related
shutdowns” in 40 CFR 63.2292, and to add a work practice for these
shutdown events. The proposed work practice requires facilities to
follow documented site-specific procedures such as use of automated
controls or other measures developed to protect workers and equipment to
ensure that the flow of raw materials (such as furnish or resin) and
fuel or process heat (as applicable) ceases and that material is removed
from the process unit(s) as expeditiously as possible given the system
design. These actions are taken by all (including the best-performing)
facilities when safety-related shutdowns occur.

Pressurized refiners typically operate in MDF and dry-process hardboard
mills where they discharge refined furnish and exhaust gases from
refining directly into a primary tube dryer. Pressurized refiners are
unable to vent through the dryer to the control system (i.e , the dryer
control system) for a brief time after they are initially fed wood
material during startup or as wood material clears the refiner during
shutdown because they are not producing useable furnish suitable for
drying. During this time, instead of the pressurized refiner output
being discharged into the dryer, exhaust is vented to the atmosphere and
the wood is directed to storage for recycling back into the refining
process once it is running steadily. Information from the PCWP industry
indicates that no resin is mixed with the off-specification material and
that the time periods are short (i.e , no more than 15 minutes) before
the pressurized refiner begins to discharge wood furnish and exhaust
through the dryer. Information collected through the ICR indicates a
range of pressurized refiner startup times before wood furnish is
introduced into the system (e.g , up to 4 hours) and that up to 45
minutes is required to shut down the pressurized refiner including time
after the wood clears the system. Hence, the time when off-specification
material is produced (when emissions are beginning to be generated
during startup or diminishing during shutdown) is only a fraction of the
pressurized refiner startup and shutdown time. Based on this
information, the EPA is proposing a work practice requirement to apply
during pressurized refiner startup and shutdown that limits the amount
of time (and, thus, emissions) when wood is being processed through the
system while exhaust is not routed through the dryer to its control
system. The proposed work practice requires facilities to route exhaust
gases from the pressurized refiner to its control system no later than
15 minutes after furnish is fed to the pressurized refiner when starting
up and no more than 15 minutes after furnish ceases to be fed to the
pressurized refiner when shutting down. This practice is consistent with
how the best-performing facilities complete startup and shutdown of
pressurized refiners.

The new definition in 40 CFR 63.2292 and the new work practice standards
in Table 3 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD are designed to address
safety-related shutdowns and refiner startup/shutdown periods.
Facilities have ample profit-incentive to keep the periods when these
work practice standards will be in effect as short as possible because
they are unable to produce usable product during safety-related
shutdowns or pressurized refiner startup/shutdown periods.

Periods of startup, normal operations, and shutdown are all predictable
and routine aspects of a source's operations. Malfunctions, in contrast,
are neither predictable nor routine. Instead they are, by definition,
sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failures of emissions
control, process, or monitoring equipment. (40 CFR 63.2) (Definition of
malfunction). The EPA interprets CAA section 112 as not requiring
emissions that occur during periods of malfunction to be factored into
development of CAA section 112 standards and this reading has been
upheld as reasonable by the Court in U.S Sugar Corp. v. EPA, 830 F.3d
579, 606-610 (2016). Under section CAA 112, emissions standards for new
sources must be no less stringent than the level “achieved” by the best
controlled similar source and for existing sources generally must be no
less stringent than the average emission limitation “achieved” by the
best performing 12 percent of sources in the category. There is nothing
in section CAA 112 that directs the Agency to consider malfunctions in
determining the level “achieved” by the best performing sources when
setting emission standards. As the Court has recognized, the phrase
“average emissions limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent
of ” sources “says nothing about how the performance of the best units
is to be calculated.” Nat'l Ass'n of Clean Water Agencies v. EPA, 734
F.3d 1115, 1141 (D.C Cir. 2013). While the EPA accounts for variability
in setting emissions standards, nothing in CAA section 112 requires the
Agency to consider malfunctions as part of that analysis. The EPA is not
required to treat a malfunction in the same manner as the type of
variation in performance that occurs during routine operations of a
source. A malfunction is a failure of the source to perform in a “normal
or usual manner” and no statutory language compels the EPA to consider
such events in setting CAA section 112 standards.

As the Court recognized in U.S Sugar Corp, accounting for malfunctions
in setting standards would be difficult, if not impossible, given the
myriad different types of malfunctions that can occur across all sources
in the category and given the difficulties associated with predicting or
accounting for the frequency, degree, and duration of various
malfunctions that might occur. Id. at 608 (“the EPA would have to
conceive of a standard that could apply equally to the wide range of
possible boiler malfunctions, ranging from an explosion to minor
mechanical defects. Any possible standard is likely to be hopelessly
generic to govern such a wide array of circumstances”). As such, the
performance of units that are malfunctioning is not “reasonably”
foreseeable. See, e.g , Sierra Club v. EPA, 167 F.3d 658, 662 (D.C Cir.
1999) (“The EPA typically has wide latitude in determining the extent of
data-gathering necessary to solve a problem. We generally defer to an
agency's decision to proceed on the basis of imperfect scientific
information, rather than to `invest the resources to conduct the perfect
study.' ”) See also, Weyerhaeuser v. Costle, 590 F.2d 1011, 1058 (D.C
Cir. 1978) (“In the nature of things, no general limit, individual
permit, or even any upset provision can anticipate all upset situations.
After a certain point, the transgression of regulatory limits caused by
`uncontrollable acts of third parties,' such as strikes, sabotage,
operator intoxication or insanity, and a variety of other eventualities,
must be a matter for the administrative exercise of case-by-case
enforcement discretion, not for specification in advance by
regulation.”). In addition, emissions during a malfunction event can be
significantly higher than emissions at any other time of source
operation. For example, if an air pollution control device with
99-percent removal goes off-line as a result of a malfunction (as might
happen if, for example, the bags in a baghouse catch fire) and the
emission unit is a steady state type unit that would take days to shut
down, the source would go from 99-percent control to zero control until
the control device was repaired. The source's emissions during the
malfunction would be 100 times higher than during normal operations. As
such, the emissions over a 4-day malfunction period would exceed the
annual emissions of the source during normal operations. As this example
illustrates, accounting for malfunctions could lead to standards that
are not reflective of (and significantly less stringent than) levels
that are achieved by a well-performing non-malfunctioning source. It is
reasonable to interpret CAA section 112 to avoid such a result. The
EPA's approach to malfunctions is consistent with CAA section 112 and is
a reasonable interpretation of the statute.

Although no statutory language compels the EPA to set standards for
malfunctions, the EPA has the discretion to do so where feasible. For
example, in the Petroleum Refinery Sector RTR, the EPA established a
work practice standard for unique types of malfunction that result in
releases from pressure relief devices or emergency flaring events
because the EPA had information to determine that such work practices
reflected the level of control that applies to the best performers. 80
FR 75178, 75211-14 (December 1, 2015). The EPA will consider whether
circumstances warrant setting standards for a particular type of
malfunction and, if so, whether the EPA has sufficient information to
identify the relevant best performing sources and establish a standard
for such malfunctions. The EPA also encourages commenters to provide any
such information.

In the event that a source fails to comply with the applicable CAA
section 112(d) standards as a result of a malfunction event, the EPA
would determine an appropriate response based on, among other things,
the good faith efforts of the source to minimize emissions during
malfunction periods, including preventative and corrective actions, as
well as root cause analyses to ascertain and rectify excess emissions.
The EPA would also consider whether the source's failure to comply with
the CAA section 112(d) standard was, in fact, sudden, infrequent, not
reasonably preventable, and was not instead caused, in part, by poor
maintenance or careless operation per 40 CFR 63.2 (Definition of
malfunction).

If the EPA determines in a particular case that an enforcement action
against a source for violation of an emission standard is warranted, the
source can raise any and all defenses in that enforcement action and the
federal district court will determine what, if any, relief is
appropriate. The same is true for citizen enforcement actions.
Similarly, the presiding officer in an administrative proceeding can
consider any defense raised and determine whether administrative
penalties are appropriate.

In summary, the EPA interpretation of the CAA and, in particular,
section 112, is reasonable and encourages practices that will avoid
malfunctions. Administrative and judicial procedures for addressing
exceedances of the standards fully recognize that violations may occur
despite good faith efforts to comply and can accommodate those
situations. U.S Sugar Corp. v. EPA, 830 F.3d 579, 606-610 (2016).a.
General Duty (40 CFR 63.2250)

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.6(e)(1) and (2) by redesignating it as 40 CFR
63.6(e)(1)(i) and changing the “yes” in column 4 to a “no” in column 5
which was added to specify requirements on and after the date 181 days
after the effective date of the final amendments. Section 63.6(e)(1)(i)
describes the general duty to minimize emissions. Some of the language
in that section is no longer necessary or appropriate in light of the
elimination of the SSM exemption. The EPA is proposing instead to add
general duty regulatory text at 40 CFR 63.2250 that reflects the general
duty to minimize emissions while eliminating the reference to periods
covered by an SSM exemption. The current language in 40 CFR
63.6(e)(1)(i) characterizes what the general duty entails during periods
of SSM. With the elimination of the SSM exemption, there is no need to
differentiate between normal operations, startup and shutdown, and
malfunction events in describing the general duty. Therefore, the
language the EPA is proposing for 40 CFR 63.2250 eliminates that
language from 40 CFR 63.6(e)(1).

The EPA is also proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table
10) by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.6(e)(1)(ii) and including a “no” in
column 5. Section 63.6(e)(1)(ii) imposes requirements that are not
necessary with the elimination of the SSM exemption or are redundant
with the general duty requirement being added at 40 CFR 63.2250 b. SSM
Plan

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3) by changing the “yes” in column 4 to a “no”
in column 5. Generally, the paragraphs under 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3) require
development of an SSM plan and specify SSM recordkeeping and reporting
requirements related to the SSM plan. As noted, the EPA is proposing to
remove the SSM exemptions. Therefore, affected units will be subject to
an emission standard during such events. The applicability of a standard
during such events will ensure that sources have ample incentive to plan
for and achieve compliance and, thus, the SSM plan requirements are no
longer necessary.c. Compliance With Standards

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.6(f)(1) by changing the “yes” in column 4 to a “no”
in column 5. The current language of 40 CFR 63.6(f)(1) exempts sources
from non-opacity standards during periods of SSM. As discussed above,
the Court in Sierra Club vacated the exemptions contained in this
provision and held that the CAA requires that some CAA section 112
standard apply continuously. Consistent with Sierra Club, the EPA is
proposing to revise standards in this rule to apply at all times.

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.6(h)(1) through (9) by redesignating it as 40 CFR
63.6(h)(1) and changing the “NA” in column 4 to a “no” in column 5. The
current language of 40 CFR 63.6(h)(1) exempts sources from opacity
standards during periods of SSM. As discussed above, the Court in Sierra
Club vacated the exemptions contained in this provision and held that
the CAA requires that some CAA section 112 standards apply continuously.
Consistent with Sierra Club, the EPA is proposing to revise standards in
this rule to apply at all times.d. Performance Testing (40 CFR 63.2262)

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.7(e)(1) by changing the “yes” in column 4 to a “no”
in column 5. Section 63.7(e)(1) describes performance testing
requirements. The EPA is instead proposing to add a performance testing
requirement at 40 CFR 63.2262(a)-(b). The performance testing
requirements the EPA is proposing to add differ from the General
Provisions performance testing provisions in several respects. The
regulatory text does not include the language in 40 CFR 63.7(e)(1) that
restated the SSM exemption. The proposed performance testing provisions
remove reference to 40 CFR 63.7(e)(1), reiterate the requirement that
was already included in the PCWP rule to conduct emissions tests under
representative operating conditions, and clarify that representative
operating conditions excludes periods of startup and shutdown. As in 40
CFR 63.7(e)(1), performance tests conducted under this subpart should
not be conducted during malfunctions because conditions during
malfunctions are often not representative of normal operating
conditions. The EPA is proposing to add language that requires the owner
or operator to record the process information that is necessary to
document operating conditions during the test and include in such record
an explanation to support that such conditions are representative.
Section 63.7(e) requires that the owner or operator make available to
the Administrator such records “as may be necessary to determine the
condition of the performance test” upon request but does not
specifically require the information to be recorded. The regulatory text
the EPA is proposing to add to this provision builds on that requirement
and makes explicit the requirement to record the information.

The definition of “representative operating conditions” in 40 CFR
63.2292 is also proposed to be clarified to exclude periods of startup
and shutdown. Representative operating conditions include a range of
operating conditions under which the process unit and control device
typically operate and are not limited to conditions of optimal
performance of the process unit and control device.e. Monitoring

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.8(c)(1)(i) and (iii) by changing the “yes” in column
4 to a “no” in column 5. The cross-references to the general duty and
SSM plan requirements in those subparagraphs are not necessary in light
of other requirements of 40 CFR 63.8 that require good air pollution
control practices (40 CFR 63.8(c)(1)) and that set out the requirements
of a quality control program for monitoring equipment (40 CFR 63.8(d)).

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.8(d)(3) and including a “no” in column
5. The final sentence in 40 CFR 63.8(d)(3) refers to the General
Provisions' SSM plan requirement which is no longer applicable. The EPA
is proposing to add to the rule at 40 CFR 63.2282(f) text that is
identical to 40 CFR 63.8(d)(3) except that the final sentence is
replaced with the following sentence: “The program of corrective action
should be included in the plan required under 40 CFR 63.8(d)(2).”f.
Recordkeeping (40 CFR 63.2282)

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(i) through (iv) by redesignating it as 40
CFR 63.10(b)(2)(i) and changing the “yes” in column 4 to a “no” in
column 5. Section 63.10(b)(2)(i) describes the recordkeeping
requirements during startup and shutdown. The EPA is instead proposing
to add recordkeeping requirements to 40 CFR 63.2282(a). When a source is
subject to a different standard during startup and shutdown, it will be
important to know when such startup and shutdown periods begin and end
to determine compliance with the appropriate standard. Thus, the EPA is
proposing to add language to 40 CFR 63.2282(a) requiring that sources
subject to an emission standard during startup or shutdown that differs
from the emission standard that applies at all other times must report
the date, time, and duration of such periods.

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(ii) and including a “no” in
column 5. Section 63.10(b)(2)(ii) describes the recordkeeping
requirements during a malfunction. The EPA is proposing to add such
requirements to 40 CFR 63.2282(a). The regulatory text the EPA is
proposing to add differs from the General Provisions it is replacing in
that the General Provisions requires the creation and retention of a
record of the occurrence and duration of each malfunction of process,
air pollution control, and monitoring equipment. The EPA is proposing
that this requirement apply to any failure to meet an applicable
standard and is requiring that the source record the date, time, and
duration of the failure rather than the “occurrence.” The EPA is also
proposing to add to 40 CFR 63.2282(a) a requirement that sources keep
records that include a list of the affected source or equipment and
actions taken to minimize emissions, an estimate of the quantity of each
regulated pollutant emitted over the standard for which the source
failed to meet the standard, and a description of the method used to
estimate the emissions. Examples of such methods would include
product-loss calculations, mass balance calculations, measurements when
available, or engineering judgment based on known process parameters.
The EPA is proposing to require that sources keep records of this
information to ensure that there is adequate information to allow the
EPA to determine the severity of any failure to meet a standard, and to
provide data that may document how the source met the general duty to
minimize emissions when the source has failed to meet an applicable
standard.

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(iv) and including a “no” in
column 5. When applicable, the provision requires sources to record
actions taken during SSM events when actions were inconsistent with
their SSM plan. The requirement is no longer appropriate because SSM
plans will no longer be required. The requirement previously applicable
under 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(iv)(B) to record actions to minimize emissions
and record corrective actions is now applicable by reference to 40 CFR
63.2282(a).

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
by adding 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(v) to the entry for 40 CFR 63.10(b)(2)(iv)
and including a “no” in column 5. When applicable, the provision
requires sources to record actions taken during SSM events to show that
actions taken were consistent with their SSM plan. The requirement is no
longer appropriate because SSM plans will no longer be required.

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.10(c)(15) and including a “no” in
column 5. The EPA is proposing that 40 CFR 63.10(c)(15) no longer apply.
When applicable, the provision allows an owner or operator to use the
affected source's SSM plan or records kept to satisfy the recordkeeping
requirements of the SSM plan, specified in 40 CFR 63.6(e), to also
satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 63.10(c)(10) through (12). The EPA is
proposing to eliminate this requirement because SSM plans would no
longer be required, and, therefore, 40 CFR 63.10(c)(15) no longer serves
any useful purpose for affected units.g. Reporting (40 CFR 63.2281)

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
entry for 40 CFR 63.10(d)(5) by redesignating it as 40 CFR
63.10(d)(5)(i) and changing the “yes” in column 4 to a “no” in column 5.
Section 63.10(d)(5)(i) describes the reporting requirements for
startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. To replace the General Provisions
reporting requirement, the EPA is proposing to add reporting
requirements to 40 CFR 63.2281(d) and (e). The replacement language
differs from the General Provisions requirement in that it eliminates
periodic SSM reports as a stand-alone report. The EPA is proposing
language that requires sources that fail to meet an applicable standard
at any time to report the information concerning such events in the
semiannual compliance report already required under this rule. The EPA
is proposing that the report must contain the number, date, time,
duration, and the cause of such events (including unknown cause, if
applicable), a list of the affected source or equipment, an estimate of
the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission
limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
Examples of such methods would include product-loss calculations, mass
balance calculations, measurements when available, or engineering
judgment based on known process parameters. The EPA is proposing this
requirement to ensure that there is adequate information to determine
compliance, to allow the EPA to determine the severity of the failure to
meet an applicable standard, and to provide data that may document how
the source met the general duty to minimize emissions during a failure
to meet an applicable standard.

The EPA will no longer require owners or operators to determine whether
actions taken to correct a malfunction are consistent with an SSM plan,
because plans would no longer be required. The proposed amendments,
therefore, eliminate the cross-reference to 40 CFR 63.10(d)(5)(i) that
contains the description of the previously required SSM report format
and submittal schedule from this section. These specifications are no
longer necessary because the events will be reported in otherwise
required reports with similar format and submittal requirements.

The EPA is proposing to revise the General Provisions table (Table 10)
by adding an entry for 40 CFR 63.10(d)(5)(ii) and including a “no” in
column 5. Section 63.10(d)(5)(ii) describes an immediate report for
startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when a source failed to meet an
applicable standard but did not follow the SSM plan. The EPA will no
longer require owners and operators to report when actions taken during
a startup, shutdown, or malfunction were not consistent with an SSM
plan, because plans would no longer be required.2. Electronic Reporting

The EPA is proposing that owners and operators of PCWP facilities submit
electronic copies of required performance test reports, performance
evaluation reports for continuous monitoring systems (CMS) measuring
relative accuracy test audit (RATA) pollutants (i.e , total hydrocarbon
monitors), selected notifications, and semiannual reports through the
EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) using the Compliance and Emissions
Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). A description of the electronic data
submission process is provided in the memorandum, Electronic Reporting
Requirements for New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) Rules,
available in Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243. The proposed rule
requires that performance test results collected using test methods that
are supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on
the ERT website (27) at the time of the test be submitted in the format
generated through the use of the ERT and that other performance test
results be submitted in portable document format (PDF) using the
attachment module of the ERT. Similarly, performance evaluation results
of CMS measuring RATA pollutants that are supported by the ERT at the
time of the test must be submitted in the format generated through the
use of the ERT and other performance evaluation results be submitted in
PDF using the attachment module of the ERT.

For the PCWP semiannual report, the proposed rule requires that owners
and operators use the appropriate spreadsheet template to submit
information to CEDRI. A draft version of the proposed template for this
report is included in the docket for this rulemaking. (28) The EPA
specifically requests comment on the content, layout, and overall design
of the template. In addition, the EPA is proposing to require future
initial notifications developed according to 40 CFR 63.2280(b) and
notifications of compliance status developed according to 40 CFR
63.2280(d) to be uploaded in CEDRI in a user-specified (e.g , PDF)
format.

Additionally, the EPA has identified two broad circumstances in which
electronic reporting extensions may be provided. In both circumstances,
the decision to accept the claim of needing additional time to report is
within the discretion of the Administrator, and reporting should occur
as soon as possible. The EPA is providing these potential extensions to
protect owners and operators from noncompliance in cases where they
cannot successfully submit a report by the reporting deadline for
reasons outside of their control. The situation where an extension may
be warranted due to outages of the EPA's CDX or CEDRI which precludes an
owner or operator from accessing the system and submitting required
reports is addressed in 40 CFR 63.2281(k). The situation where an
extension may be warranted due to a force majeure event, which is
defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances
beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any
entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents an owner or
operator from complying with the requirement to submit a report
electronically as required by this rule is addressed in 40 CFR
63.2281(l). Examples of such events are acts of nature, acts of war or
terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazards beyond the control of
the facility.

The electronic submittal of the reports addressed in this proposed
rulemaking will increase the usefulness of the data contained in those
reports, is in keeping with current trends in data availability and
transparency, will further assist in the protection of public health and
the environment, will improve compliance by facilitating the ability of
regulated facilities to demonstrate compliance with requirements and by
facilitating the ability of delegated state, local, tribal, and
territorial air agencies and the EPA to assess and determine compliance,
and will ultimately reduce burden on regulated facilities, delegated air
agencies, and the EPA. Electronic reporting also eliminates paper-based,
manual processes, thereby saving time and resources, simplifying data
entry, eliminating redundancies, minimizing data reporting errors, and
providing data quickly and accurately to the affected facilities, air
agencies, the EPA, and the public. Moreover, electronic reporting is
consistent with the EPA's plan (29) to implement Executive Order 13563
and is in keeping with the EPA's Agency-wide policy (30) developed in
response to the White House's Digital Government Strategy. (31) For more
information on the benefits of electronic reporting, see the memorandum
Electronic Reporting Requirements for New Source Performance Standards
(NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
(NESHAP) Rules, available in Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0243.3.
Repeat Emissions Testing

As part of an ongoing effort to improve compliance with various federal
air emission regulations, the EPA reviewed the emissions testing
requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, and is proposing to
require facilities complying with the standards in Table 1B of 40 CFR
part 63, subpart DDDD using an add-on control system other than a
biofilter to conduct repeat emissions performance testing every 5 years.
Currently, facilities operating add-on controls are required to conduct
an initial performance test by the date specified in 40 CFR 63.2261(a).
In addition to the initial performance test, process units controlled by
biofilters are already required by the PCWP NESHAP to conduct repeat
performance testing every 2 years. Periodic performance tests for all
types of control systems are already required by permitting authorities
for many facilities. Further, the EPA believes that requiring repeat
performance tests will help to ensure that control systems are properly
maintained over time. As proposed in Table 7 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart
DDDD (row 7) the first of the repeat performance tests would be required
to be conducted within 3 years of the effective date of the revised
standards or within 60 months following the previous performance test,
whichever is later, and thereafter within 5 years (60 months) following
the previous performance test. Section IV.E of this preamble provides
more information on compliance dates. We specifically request comment on
the proposed repeat testing requirements.4. Biofilter Bed Temperature

Facilities using a biofilter to comply with the PCWP NESHAP must monitor
biofilter bed temperature and maintain the 24-hour block biofilter bed
temperature within the range established during performance testing
showing compliance with the emission limits. The upper and lower limits
of the biofilter bed temperature are currently required to be
established as the highest and lowest 15-minute average bed
temperatures, respectively, during the three test runs. Facilities may
conduct multiple performance tests to expand the biofilter bed operating
temperature range. See 40 CFR 63.2262(m).

The EPA has become aware that multiple facilities are having difficulty
with the PCWP biofilter bed temperature monitoring requirements as
originally promulgated. Biofilter bed temperature is affected by ambient
temperature. Diurnal and seasonal ambient temperature fluctuations do
not necessarily impact the ability of the biofilter to reduce HAP
emissions because biofilters reduce HAP (e.g , formaldehyde) emissions
over a wide range of bed temperatures. Facilities have indicated they
are not able to schedule performance tests on the warmest and coolest
days of each season because test firms must plan and mobilize for tests
weeks in advance and facilities must notify their delegated authority 60
days before conducting a performance test. For example, facilities may
schedule a test in the winter with the intent of measuring emissions
during the coldest conditions in which a biofilter performs, only to
find that the weather changes on the test date to a warmer than expected
ambient temperature. In consideration of this issue, the EPA reviewed
biofilter temperature monitoring data, semiannual compliance reports,
and test data showing that formaldehyde reductions in compliance with
emission standards were achieved at a wide range of biofilter bed
temperatures. The EPA is proposing to amend 40 CFR 63.2262(m)(1) to add
a 5-percent variability margin to the biofilter bed temperature upper
and lower limits established during emissions testing. A 5-percent
variability margin addresses the issues observed in the 24-hour block
average biofilter temperature monitoring data reviewed. The EPA
maintains that the currently-required 24-hour block averaging time is
appropriate to monitor for harsh swings in biofilter bed temperature
that could impact the viability of the microbial population. The
5-percent variability margin provides flexibility needed to account for
small variations in biofilter bed temperature unlikely to impact the
microbial population.

While the proposed regulatory language does not explicitly state that
facilities can use the 5-percent variability margin to expand the range
of the biofilter bed temperature limit established though previously
conducted performance tests, the EPA anticipates that facilities
currently having difficulty maintaining the biofilter bed temperature
limits may wish to adjust their temperature limits. As originally
promulgated, 40 CFR 63.2262(m)(1) states that facilities may base their
biofilter bed temperature range on values recorded during previous
performance tests provided that the data used to establish the
temperature ranges have been obtained using the required test methods;
and that facilities using data from previous performance tests must
certify that the biofilter and associated process unit(s) have not been
modified since the test. This provision (if met) clarifies that
facilities can adjust their previously established biofilter temperature
range to include the 5-percent variability margin, if desired.
Facilities are encouraged to demonstrate the broadest limits of their
compliant temperature operating parameters with their regular
performance tests.5. Thermocouple Calibration

Facilities with controlled sources subject to the PCWP NESHAP that use
regenerative thermal or catalytic oxidizers to comply with the standard
are required to establish a minimum operating temperature during
performance testing then maintain a 3-hour block average firebox
temperature above the minimum temperature established during the
performance test to demonstrate ongoing compliance. Facilities with
controlled sources subject to the PCWP NESHAP that use biofilters to
comply with the standard are required to establish an operating
temperature range during performance testing then maintain a 24-hour
block average temperature within the temperature range established
during the performance test to demonstrate ongoing compliance. (40 CFR
part 63, subpart DDDD, Table 2). Facilities with dry rotary dryers are
required to maintain their 24-hour block average inlet dryer temperature
less than 600 degrees Fahrenheit. (40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, Table
3). Thermocouples are used to measure the temperature in the firebox,
the biofilter, and the dry rotary dryer. At 40 CFR 63.2269(b)(4), the
PCWP NESHAP currently requires conducting an electronic calibration of
the temperature monitoring device at least semiannually according to the
procedures in the manufacturer's owner's manual. Facilities subject to
the standard have explained to the EPA that they are not aware of a
thermocouple manufacturer that provides procedures or protocols for
conducting electronic calibration of thermocouples. Facilities have
reported that since they cannot calibrate their thermocouples, the
alternative is to replace them and requested that an alternative
approach to the current requirement in 40 CFR 63.2269(b)(4) be
considered.

The EPA is proposing to modify 40 CFR 63.2269(b)(4) to allow multiple
alternative approaches to thermocouple calibration. The first
alternative would allow use of a National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) traceable temperature measurement device or simulator
to confirm the accuracy of any thermocouple placed into use for at least
one semi-annual period, where the accuracy of the temperature
measurement must be within 2.5 percent of the temperature measured by
the NIST traceable device or 5 °F, whichever is greater. The second
alternative would be to have the thermocouple manufacturer certify the
electrical properties of the thermocouple. The third alternative would
codify the common practice of replacing thermocouples every 6 months.
The fourth alternative would be to permanently install a redundant
temperature sensor as close as practicable to the process temperature
sensor. The redundant sensors must read within 30 °F of each other for
thermal and catalytic oxidizers, within 5 °F for biofilters, and within
20 °F for dry rotary dryers. The EPA plans to maintain the option of
allowing facilities to follow calibration procedures developed by the
thermocouple manufacturer when thermocouple manufacturers develop
calibration procedures for their products.6. Non-HAP Coating Definition

The PCWP NESHAP requires use of “non-HAP coatings” for “Group 1
miscellaneous coating operations” as defined in 40 CFR 63.2292 As
defined, PCWP non-HAP coatings exclude coatings with 0.1 percent or more
(by mass) of carcinogenic HAP. The current “non-HAP coating” definition
in 40 CFR 63.2292 references Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR
1910.1200(d)(4) which was amended (77 FR 17574, March 26, 2012) and no
longer readily defines which compounds are carcinogens. The EPA is
proposing to replace the references to OSHA-defined carcinogens and 29
CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) in the PCWP “non-HAP coating” definition with a
reference to a new appendix B to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, that
lists HAP that must be below 0.1 percent by mass for a PCWP coating to
be considered as non-HAP coating. The HAP listed in the proposed
appendix B to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, were categorized in the
EPA's Prioritized Chronic Dose-Response Values for Screening Risk
Assessments (dated May 9, 2014) as a “human carcinogen,” “probable human
carcinogen,” or “possible human carcinogen” according to The Risk
Assessment Guidelines of 1986 (EPA/600/8-87/045, August 1987), (32) or
as “carcinogenic to humans,” “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” or
with “suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential” according to the
Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (EPA/630/P-03/001F, March
2005).7. Technical and Editorial Changes

The following lists additional proposed changes that address technical
and editorial corrections:

The clarifying reference to “SSM plans” in 40 CFR 63.2252 was removed
because SSM plans will no longer be applicable; The redundant reference
in 40 CFR 63.2281(c)(6) for submittal of performance test results with
the compliance report was eliminated because performance test results
will be required to be electronically reported; The EPA revised 40 CFR
63.2281(d)(2) and added language to 40 CFR 63.2281(e)(12)-(13) to makes
these sections more consistent to facilitate electronic reporting; A
provision stating that the EPA retains authority to approve alternatives
to electronic reporting was added to 40 CFR 63.2291(c)(5);
Cross-references to the 40 CFR part 60 appendices containing test
methods were updated in Table 4 of the rule; Cross-references were
updated throughout the rule, as needed, to match the proposed changes;
Cross-references to 40 CFR 63.14 to remove outdated paragraph references
were updated; The equation number cross-referenced in the definition of
“MSF” was corrected; and The cross-reference in 40 CFR 63.2290 to
include all sections of the General Provisions was updated.

E. What compliance dates are we proposing?

The EPA is proposing that existing affected sources and other affected
sources that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before
September 6, 2019 must comply with all of the amendments 6 months (180
days) after the effective date of the final rule. (33) For existing
sources, the EPA is proposing changes that would impact ongoing
compliance requirements for 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD. As discussed
elsewhere in this preamble, the EPA is proposing to change the
requirements for SSM by removing the exemption from the requirements to
meet the standard during SSM periods and by removing the requirement to
develop and implement an SSM plan. The EPA is also proposing addition of
electronic reporting requirements that will require use of a semiannual
reporting template once the template has been available on the CEDRI
website
(https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/compliance-and-emissions-data-reporting-interface-cedri)
for 6 months. The EPA's experience with similar industries shows that
this sort of regulated facility generally requires a time-period of 180
days to read and understand the amended rule requirements; to evaluate
their operations to ensure that they can meet the standards during
periods of startup and shutdown as defined in the rule and make any
necessary adjustments; and to update their operations to reflect the
revised requirements. From our assessment of the time frame needed for
compliance with the revised requirements, the EPA considers a period of
180 days to be the most expeditious compliance period practicable, and,
thus, is proposing that existing affected sources be in compliance with
this regulation's revised requirements within 180 days of the
regulation's effective date. All existing affected facilities would have
to continue to meet the current requirements of this NESHAP until the
applicable compliance date of the amended rule. Affected sources that
commence construction or reconstruction after September 6, 2019 must
comply with all requirements of the subpart, including the amendments
being proposed, no later than the effective date of the final rule or
upon initial startup, whichever is later.

Also, the EPA is proposing new requirements to conduct repeat
performance testing every 5 years for facilities using an add-on control
system other than a biofilter (see section IV.D.3 of this preamble).
Establishing a compliance date earlier than 3 years for the first repeat
performance test can cause scheduling issues as affected sources compete
for a limited number of testing contractors. Considering these
scheduling issues, the first of the repeat performance tests would be
required to be conducted within 3 years after the effective date of the
revised standards, or within 60 months following the previous
performance test, whichever is later, and thereafter within 5 years (60
months) following the previous performance test. Thus, facilities with
relatively new affected sources that recently conducted the initial
performance test by the date specified in 40 CFR 63.2261(a) or
facilities that were required by their delegated authorities to conduct
a performance test to show ongoing compliance with the PCWP standards
would have 5 years (60 months) from the previous test before being
required to conduct the first of the repeat tests required by the
proposed amendment to add repeat testing.

The EPA specifically seeks comment on whether the compliance times
described in this section provide enough time for owners and operators
to comply with these proposed amendments, and if the proposed time
window is not adequate, we request that commenters provide an
explanation of specific actions that would need to be undertaken to
comply with the proposed amended requirements and the time needed to
make the adjustments for compliance with any of the revised
requirements. The EPA notes that information provided may result in
changes to the proposed compliance date.V. Summary of Cost,
Environmental, and Economic ImpactsA. What are the affected sources?

The EPA has identified 230 facilities that are currently operating and
subject to the PCWP NESHAP. This includes 109 facilities manufacturing
one or more PCWP products (e.g , plywood, veneer, particleboard, OSB,
hardboard, fiberboard, MDF, engineered wood products) and 121 facilities
that produce kiln-dried lumber. Sixteen facilities produce PCWP products
and kiln-dried lumber. Information on currently operational facilities
is included in the Technology Review for the Plywood and Composite Wood
Products NESHAP, available in the docket for this action. In addition,
the EPA is aware of 13 greenfield facilities (four PCWP and nine
kiln-dried lumber mills) that recently commenced construction as major
sources of HAP emissions. The EPA is projecting that two new OSB mills
will be constructed as major sources within the next 5 years, and that
existing facilities will add or replace process units during this same
time frame. More details on our projections of new sources are available
in Projections of the Number of New and Reconstructed Sources for the
Subpart DDDD Technology Review, in the docket for this action.B. What
are the air quality impacts?

The nationwide baseline HAP emissions from the 230 facilities in the
PCWP source category are estimated to be 7,600 tons/year. Emissions of
the six compounds defined as “total HAP” in the PCWP NESHAP
(acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde, methanol, phenol, and
propionaldehyde) make up 96 percent of the nationwide emissions. The
proposed amendments include removal of the SSM exemption and addition of
repeat emissions testing for controls other than biofilters (which are
already require repeat tests). Although the EPA is unable to quantify
the emission reduction associated with these changes, we expect that
emissions will be reduced by requiring facilities to meet the applicable
standard during periods of SSM and that the repeat emissions testing
requirements will encourage operation of add-on controls to achieve
optimum performance. The EPA is not proposing other revisions to the
emission limits that would impact emissions, so there are no
quantifiable air quality impacts resulting from the proposed
amendments.C. What are the cost impacts?

No capital costs are estimated to be incurred to comply with the
proposed amendments. The costs associated with the proposed amendments
are related to recordkeeping and reporting labor costs and repeat
performance testing. Because repeat performance testing would be
required every 5 years, costs are estimated and summarized over a 5-year
period. The nationwide cost of the proposed amendments is estimated to
include a one-time cost of $1.3 million for facilities to review the
revised rule and make record systems adjustments and a cost of $3.5
million every 5 years for repeat emissions testing. These costs are in
2018 dollars. Another metric for presenting the one-time costs is as a
present value (PV), which is a technique that converts a stream of costs
over time into a one-time estimate for the present year or other year.
The EPA estimates that the PV of costs for this proposal is $5.6 million
at a discount rate of 7 percent and $6.9 million at a discount rate of 3
percent. In addition, the EPA presents these costs as an equivalent
annualized value (EAV) in order to provide an estimate of annual costs
consistent with the present value. The EAV for this proposal is
estimated to be $0.9 million at a discount rate of 7 percent and $1.0
million at a discount rate of 3 percent. The PV and EAV cost estimates
are in 2016 dollars in part to conform to Executive Order 13771
requirements. For further information on the costs associated with the
proposed amendments, see the memorandum, Cost, Environmental, and Energy
Impacts of Regulatory Options for Subpart DDDD, and the memorandum,
Economic Impact and Small Business Analysis for the Proposed Plywood and
Composite Wood Products Risk and Technology Review both available in the
docket for this action.D. What are the economic impacts?

The EPA conducted an economic impact analysis for this proposal, as
detailed in the memorandum titled Economic Impact and Small Business
Analysis for the Proposed Plywood and Composite Wood Risk and Technology
Review (RTR) NESHAP, which is available in the docket for this action.
The economic impacts of the proposal are calculated as the percentage of
annualized costs incurred by affected ultimate parent owners to their
revenues. This ratio provides a measure of the direct economic impact to
ultimate parent owners of PCWP facilities while presuming no impact on
consumers. The EPA estimates that none of the ultimate parent owners
affected by this proposal will incur annualized costs of 1.0 percent or
greater of their revenues. Thus, these economic impacts are low for
affected companies and the industries impacted by this proposal, and
there will not be substantial impacts in the markets for affected
products.E. What are the benefits?

The EPA is not proposing changes to emissions limits, and estimates the
proposed changes (i.e , changes to SSM, recordkeeping, reporting, and
monitoring) are not economically significant. Because these proposed
amendments are not considered economically significant, as defined by
Executive Order 12866, and because no emissions reductions were
estimated, the EPA did not estimate any benefits from reducing
emissions.VI. Request for Comments

The EPA solicits comments on this proposed action. In addition to
general comments on this proposed action, the EPA is also interested in
additional data that may improve the risk assessments and other
analyses. The EPA is specifically interested in receiving any
improvements to the data used in the site-specific emissions profiles
used for risk modeling. Such data should include supporting
documentation in sufficient detail to allow characterization of the
quality and representativeness of the data or information. Section VII
of this preamble provides more information on submitting data.VII.

notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in the NESHAP
General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart A), which are mandatory for
all operators subject to national emissions standards. The information
collection activities also include paperwork requirements associated
with initial and repeat performance testing and parameter monitoring.
The proposed amendments to the rule would eliminate the paperwork
requirements associated with the SSM plan and recordkeeping of SSM
events and require electronic submittal of performance test results and
semiannual compliance reports. These recordkeeping and reporting
requirements are specifically authorized by CAA section 114 (42 U.S.C
7414).

Respondents/affected entities: Owners and operators of facilities
subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD, that produce plywood, composite
wood products, or kiln-dried lumber.

Respondent's obligation to respond: Mandatory (40 CFR part 63, subpart
DDDD).

Estimated number of respondents: 244 facilities (including existing and
new facilities projected to begin reporting during the ICR period).

Frequency of response: The frequency varies depending on the type of
response (e.g , initial notification, semiannual compliance report).

Total estimated burden: 39,700 hours (per year). Burden is defined at 5
CFR 1320.3(b).

Total estimated cost: $6,930,000 (per year), includes $2,365,000
annualized capital or operation and maintenance costs.

An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently
valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for the EPA's
regulations in 40 CFR are listed in 40 CFR part 9.

Submit your comments on the Agency's need for this information, the
accuracy of the provided burden estimates, and any suggested methods for
minimizing respondent burden to the EPA using the docket identified at
the beginning of this rule. You may also send your ICR-related comments
to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs via email to OIRA
at oira_submission@omb.eop.gov, Attention: Desk Officer for the EPA.
Since OMB is required to make a decision concerning the ICR between 30
and 60 days after receipt, OMB must receive comments no later than
October 7, 2019. The EPA will respond to any ICR-related comments in the
final rule.D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)

I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the RFA. In making this
determination, the impact of concern is any significant adverse economic
impact on small entities. An agency may certify that a rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities if the rule relieves regulatory burden, has no net burden, or
otherwise has a positive economic effect on the small entities subject
to the rule. Of the 69 ultimate parent entities that are subject to the
rule, 28 are small according to the Small Business Administration's
small business size standards and standards regarding other entities
(e.g , federally recognized tribes). None of the 28 small entities have
annualized costs of 1 percent or greater of sales. The EPA has,
therefore, concluded that this action will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities.E. Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act (UMRA)

This action does not contain any unfunded mandate as described in UMRA,
2 U.S.C 1531-1538, and does not significantly or uniquely affect small
governments. The action imposes no enforceable duty on any state, local,
or tribal governments or the private sector.F. Executive Order 13132:
Federalism

This action does not have federalism implications. It will not have
substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government.G. Executive
Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal
Governments

This action does not have tribal implications as specified in Executive
Order 13175. It will not have substantial direct effects on tribal
governments, on the relationship between the federal government and
Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
between the federal government and Indian tribes. No tribal governments
own facilities that are impacted by the proposed changes to the NESHAP.
Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action.H. Executive
Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and
Safety Risks

This action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not
economically significant as defined in Executive Order 12866, and
because the EPA does not believe the environmental health or safety
risks addressed by this action present a disproportionate risk to
children. This action's health and risk assessments are contained in
sections III and IV of this preamble and further documented in the risk
report titled Residual Risk Assessment for the Plywood and Composite
Wood Products Source Category in Support of the 2019 Risk and Technology
Review Proposed Rule, which can be found in the docket for this
action.I. Executive Order 13211: Actions Concerning Regulations That
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use

This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211, because it is not a
significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.J. National
Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) and 1 CFR Part 51

This action involves technical standards. The EPA proposes to use the
standards currently listed in Table 4 of the rule (40 CFR part 63,
subpart DDDD). While the EPA has identified another 18 voluntary
consensus standards (VCS) as being potentially applicable to this
proposed rule, the EPA has decided not to use these VCS in this
rulemaking. The use of these VCS would not be practical due to lack of
equivalency, documentation, validation date, and other important
technical and policy considerations. See the memorandum titled Voluntary
Consensus Standard Results for NESHAP: Plywood and Composite Wood
Products RTR, in the docket for this proposed rule for the reasons for
these determinations.

The EPA proposes to amend 40 CFR 63.14 to incorporate by reference EPA
Method 0011 for measurement of formaldehyde. EPA Method 0011 (Revision
0, December 1996) is available in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid
Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods”, EPA Publication No. SW-846. This
method was included in the PCWP rule when it was promulgated in 2004.

Under 40 CFR 63.7(f) and 40 CFR 63.8(f) of subpart A of the General
Provisions, a source may apply to the EPA for permission to use
alternative test methods or alternative monitoring requirements in place
of any required testing methods, performance specifications, or
procedures in the final rule or any amendments.

The EPA welcomes comments on this aspect of the proposed rulemaking and,
specifically, invites the public to identify potentially applicable VCS
and to explain why such standards should be used in this regulation.K.
Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice
in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations

The EPA believes that this action does not have disproportionately high
and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority
populations, low-income populations, and/or indigenous peoples, as
specified in Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).

The documentation for this decision is contained in section IV.A.6 of
this preamble and the technical report, Risk and Technology
Review—Analysis of Demographic Factors for Populations Living Near
Plywood and Composite Wood Products Source Category, in the public
docket for this action.List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 63

REGISTER].

* * * * *

(e) You must be in compliance with the provisions of subpart A of this
part, except as noted in Table 10 to this subpart.

(f) Upon [DATE OF PUBLICATION OF FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] or
initial startup of the affected source, whichever is later, for affected
sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after September 6,
2019, and on and after [DATE 181 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF FINAL
RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] for all other affected sources, you must
be in compliance with the compliance options, operating requirements,
and the work practice requirements in this subpart when the process
unit(s) subject to the compliance options, operating requirements, and
work practice requirements are operating, except as specified in
paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section.

(1) Prior to process unit initial startup.

(2) During safety-related shutdowns conducted according to the work
practice requirement in Table 3 to this subpart.

(g) For affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction
after September 6, 2019 and for all other affected sources on and after
[DATE 181 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL
REGISTER], you must always operate and maintain your affected source,
including air pollution control and monitoring equipment in a manner
consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing
emissions at least to the levels required by this subpart. The general
duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further
efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable
standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is
operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will
be based on information available to the Administrator which may
include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation
and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records,
and inspection of the source.

6. Section 63.2252 is revised to read as follows:§ 63.2252What are the
requirements for process units that have no control or work practice
requirements?

For process units not subject to the compliance options or work practice
requirements specified in § 63.2240 (including, but not limited to,
lumber kilns), you are not required to comply with the compliance
options, work practice requirements, performance testing, monitoring,
and recordkeeping or reporting requirements of this subpart, or any
other requirements in subpart A of this part, except for the initial
notification requirements in § 63.9(b).

7. Section 63.2262 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b), (m)(1)
and (n)(1) to read as follows:§ 63.2262How do I conduct performance
tests and establish operating requirements?

(a) You must conduct each performance test according to the requirements
in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section, and according to the
methods specified in Table 4 to this subpart.

(b) Periods when performance tests must be conducted. You must conduct
each performance test based on representative performance (i.e ,
performance based on representative operating conditions as defined in §
63.2292) of the affected source for the period being tested.
Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You
may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You
must describe representative operating conditions in your performance
test report for the process and control systems and explain why they are
representative. You must record the process information that is
necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include
in such record an explanation to support that such conditions are
representative. Upon request, you shall make available to the
Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the
conditions of performance tests.

* * * * *

(m) * * *

(1) During the performance test, you must continuously monitor the
biofilter bed temperature during each of the required 1-hour test runs.
To monitor biofilter bed temperature, you may use multiple thermocouples
in representative locations throughout the biofilter bed and calculate
the average biofilter bed temperature across these thermocouples prior
to reducing the temperature data to 15-minute averages for purposes of
establishing biofilter bed temperature limits. The biofilter bed
temperature range must be established as the temperature values 5
percent below the minimum and 5 percent above the maximum 15-minute
biofilter bed temperatures monitored during the three test runs. You may
base your biofilter bed temperature range on values recorded during
previous performance tests provided that the data used to establish the
temperature ranges have been obtained using the test methods required in
this subpart. If you use data from previous performance tests, you must
certify that the biofilter and associated process unit(s) have not been
modified subsequent to the date of the performance tests. Replacement of
the biofilter media with the same type of material is not considered a
modification of the biofilter for purposes of this section.

* * * * *

(n) * * *

(1) During the performance test, you must identify and document the
process unit controlling parameter(s) that affect total HAP emissions
during the three-run performance test. The controlling parameters you
identify must coincide with the representative operating conditions you
describe according to paragraph (b) of this section. For each parameter,
you must specify appropriate monitoring methods, monitoring frequencies,
and for continuously monitored parameters, averaging times not to exceed
24 hours. The operating limit for each controlling parameter must then
be established as the minimum, maximum, range, or average (as
appropriate depending on the parameter) recorded during the performance
test. Multiple three-run performance tests may be conducted to establish
a range of parameter values under different operating conditions.

* * * * *

8. Section 63.2269 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(4) to read as
follows.§ 63.2269What are my monitoring installation, operation, and
maintenance requirements?

(b) * * *

(4) Validate the temperature sensor's reading at least semiannually
using the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v)
of this section:

(i) Compare measured readings to a National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) traceable temperature measurement device or simulate a
typical operating temperature using a NIST traceable temperature
simulation device. When the temperature measurement device method is
used, the sensor of the NIST traceable calibrated device must be placed
as close as practicable to the process sensor, and both devices must be
subjected to the same environmental conditions. The accuracy of the
temperature measured must be 2.5 percent of the temperature measured by
the NIST traceable device or 5 °F, whichever is greater.

(ii) Follow applicable procedures in the thermocouple manufacturer
owner's manual.

(iii) Request thermocouple manufacturer to certify or re-certify
electromotive force (electrical properties) of the thermocouple.

(iv) Replace thermocouple with a new certified thermocouple in lieu of
validation.

(v) Permanently install a redundant temperature sensor as close as
practicable to the process temperature sensor. The sensors must yield a
reading within 30 °F of each other for thermal oxidizers and catalytic
oxidizers; within 5 °F of each other for biofilters; and within 20 °F of
each other for dry rotary dryers.

associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control
activities; or data recorded during periods of safety-related shutdown,
pressurized refiner startup or shutdown, or control device downtime
covered in any approved routine control device maintenance exemption in
data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating
levels, nor may such data be used in fulfilling a minimum data
availability requirement, if applicable. You must use all the data
collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the
control system.

Celebrating the superhero in every dad

Body

Our readers are greatly influenced by their fathers, mostly in a
positive manner, and wish to resemble them or be their better versions
as a parent themselves

* My father has influenced me in a positive manner. He is a good dad,
good husband, and a good son. But if I were to be a father, I would not
want to be a replica of him - I would choose to be a better revised
version. He fulfils all my demands and that makes me happy. He started
his career from scratch and now is capable of meeting our needs. He is
my inspiration too. Yet there are certain habits of my dad that I do not
like. One of them being that he gets too busy with his work and does not
manage time for us. He is really hard working and spends his holidays
working. So, though I love my dad a lot, I would want him to spend more
time with us.

- Suja Baral, Pokhara

* My father has always influenced me in positive ways. He is the only
person that I look up to. From him, I have learned to be honest,
punctual, and hardworking. I do not know if I will ever be able to
become a good human being and parent like him, but I will definitely
walk his paths and lessons. To resemble my father would be my biggest
wish as a parent, but I do not believe that I will be as great as him. I
still remember those difficult days we went through in our childhood. He
sacrificed luxurious goods for us, he did not wear expensive clothes and
he never bought a vehicle for himself, only to pay for our school's bus
fares. He has compromised on his dreams to fulfil our needs and I will
be always indebted to my father.

- Indira Gurmachhan Magar

* I have grown up watching my father being more than just a parent. He
is my very first friend, teacher, motivator and a role model. And yes I
am influenced by his uniqueness, intelligence, great sense of humour -
most importantly his honesty and loyalty influences me. I do wish to
resemble my father as a parent because of his calm and smart nature. The
way he treats me as a friend gives me comfort. His childhood memories
help me to cope with obstacles. His hard work to bring the best in me
gives me good vibes to be a responsible parent.

- Prativa Poudel, Pokhara

* My father has always been my hero and idol. I am able to stand on my
own feet because of my father. He has always ensured that I am not
deprived of anything. I always got the best of everything, be it my
education, clothes, food or pocket money. He has always helped me
achieve my bucket list. I am highly influenced by him and his life. He
always handles things in a very positive way. A engineer by profession,
he is also a yoga teacher. Despite being a 70-year-old, he looks young
in comparison to people of his age due to his healthy lifestyle. He
never stood second in his education and always topped his class. This
motivates me. It is said that we can only understand our parents when we
become parents ourselves. I wish to be a good father like him. He taught
me that no matter how rich a person is, he should always work and earn
for himself and his family.

- Sailesh Chaudhary

* I am one of the luckiest of children for getting a positive and
influential father. I was the second child of my parents and we were
really poor. My father worked as a farmer but he always inspired me and
stressed on the value of education. For him education was one of the
most powerful weapons to defeat the world. He admitted me to a school
and paid my fees - he wore only a pair of ragged clothes and walked bare
feet for years. Now, after completing my Master's degree and working as
an English language trainer, I see that my father's struggles and dream
have come true. It is obvious that I would like to reflect my father in
my fatherhood and will emphasise on education. I will try to never let
him down. I wish I could be better as my father in future.

- Shiv Prasad Jaishi, Kathmandu

* My childhood was spent in my village and for further studies, my
parents sent me to Kathmandu. My father was very conscious about
providing us quality education. He himself graduated from India. It was
due to our father's wish and support that all of us brothers got
Master's degrees as well as good jobs - it has made our life easy. He
was a role model for us to be good parents. I wish to resemble my father
as a parent. Belonging to a middle-class family, my father always
thought about his children's future. My father had a deep intuition that
his sons can stand on their own.

- Shreeram Aryal, Biratnagar

* When I am around my dad, motivation flows. He has always influenced me
to understand the good and bad aspects of my life and taught me to
handle them well. He is my support system who tells me to value myself.
His honesty and determination to carry the responsibilities along with
our family, is what inspires me. He has taught me to live my life with
gratitude and he always believes in me. He has taught me to become a
fearless warrior. He has always stood beside me. He has influenced me to
become better every day. Yes, I would love to resemble my dad as a
parent because he is the best person a child would want. His love, care,
innocence, honesty and determination is something I want bring out in me
as a parent.

- Rejina KC, Pokhara

* My father has both negative and positive traits. He is short-tempered
at times but still he has been a great influence on me. As a child I was
always creative. I used to love my own company and do things that
fascinated me like writing, reading, playing teacher, or stealing my
mother's accessories. I imitated the people I saw on a daily basis. My
father always bought me stationery items. And he encouraged me to read
newspapers and books so that I could learn more to enhance my skills in
a better way. I have a father who has a broad thinking in terms of
trusting his daughter, so whatever I will do in life, I would not let
him down. This trust makes me feel blessed and responsible as well. We
talk and discuss every issue related to my life, career, or
relationships in a friendly way. My parents are the strongest pillars of
my life who always influence me. So, I would love to be a lot like them.

- Tejaswi Pahari, Jawalakhel, Lalitpur.

* I am 25 but my father still thinks that I am a child. I am okay with
that because I get his support whenever I am in trouble. I think about
him during my difficult times and just a thought of him refreshes me and
allows me to view the world in a beautiful way. I honour his way of
living and disciplined nature even though we are not so rich. It makes
me feel good and motivates me to know my limits and accept whoever I am.
I would certainly like to resemble my father as a parent as I feel lucky
to be his son and I would want my son to feel the same about me. He does
have some bad habits like drinking alcohol and chewing tobacco, but
these things are overshadowed by his radiance of honesty and grace.

- Shreejan Pokharel, Sukedhara, Kathmandu

* Being a successful businessman, his optimistic and influential side
that triggers me is the encouragement and patience my father possesses.
Similarly, like everyone my father has some negative sides as well. In
addition, parents are always careful about us so we must do good deeds
and meet their expectations. The 90's children are very vulnerable to
bad habits and influence which is why these things are less understood
by educated parents. My father always gave positive vibes during my
early teenage. So, I gradually matured in the same way. I would not opt
to be like my father as a parent because of the need for adaptation.

- Sulav Karki

* Every son wants his father to be his inspiration, every daughter wants
her father to be her superhero. Likewise, my father who I admire the
most and have spent the most fruitful and inspiring years with, has
always influenced me. Some of his qualities that I wish to learn are -
he bears all the pains for our happiness, and he never gives up on
things before getting results. He is always there for me no matter how
difficult the situation. Obviously, I always want to resemble him as he
is the only person who understands me before I even say something.

- Suresh Bhattarai, Pokhara

* My father is like a god to me. His parents left him as he is disabled.
But he made through all the hindrances and difficulties in life. I am
completely influenced by him. He always encourages me to do my best in
the field of my interest. Being a teacher, he helps me in my studies and
helps me remember things. He suggests me to become a good member of
society. In my progress and improvements, he has always given positive
remarks - it provides me strong willpower to do things. My progress lies
in my father's hands. That is why with his wish, support, love and care
I have found my way to a bright future. I wish to resemble him as a
parent in order to remember him all my life.

- Kamal Aryal, Pokhara

* My father has always encouraged me to work harder. He has risen up
after a lot of failures in his life and is a self-made man. I cannot
imagine to be even an inch like my father. The struggles, pains and
problems he has gone through in life make him different from me. I would
rather wish to resemble my father as a parent. He is a person everyone
would love to have as their father. He is supportive, humorous,
understanding and loving. He understands that we all are humans and
making mistakes is a part of growing up.

- Pragyan Swarnkar

* I rejoice the favours my father has made for me. I was the seventh
child of my parents. My father took care of me from my childhood. He
used to help me wash my clothes and bathe. His continued care about my
education and health has made a huge impact in my life. I label my
father as Karma Yogi. He has lived a life of integrity to the fullest.
As a typical Brahmin, he never touched alcoholic substances and is never
swayed by it. Whether it is prosperity or adversity, he is always the
same - he neither gets pampered nor panicked. He does not believe in
untouchability, which is quite rare for the people of his time.
Moreover, he never hesitates to do the household chores which are
typically labelled to be a woman's domain. His attitude for the value of
work and equity has made me wish to resemble my father as a parent.

- Shyam Uprety, Nijgadh, Bara

* If there is one crucial life lesson I have learned from my father it
is to respect diverse opinions of people. And I wish to resemble my
father as a parent as it is not easy for a child to naturally open up
and share things with their parents, much less with their fathers. But I
can. My dad has this humble and gentle personality to which even my
friends can be open. While around him, I can act as crazy as I want.
This is how I envision myself as a parent when I become one and will
consider myself successful if I can be half as good to my child as my
father is with me.

- Subrishti Karki

* My father has taught me a lot of lessons in my life, but the one that
stood above them all was the importance of education. He always told me
that if I wanted to be successful I would need to study hard. My dad
saved every single penny he earned from his work to buy things for me.
He always encourages me. Due to this, I admire him and think of him as
my idol. My dad has had a huge impact on how I am today. He has
influenced my life by teaching me lessons and showing me the right and
wrong direction. Through my father's hard work, he has influenced me to
become a better person. He is my inspiration to keep me motivated to
become a scientist. When I grow up, I hope to be just as hard working as
my father and to be a father just as motivating and loving as him.

- Darshan Aryal

* A father is an inspiration for every child. My father is a prime
example of hard work, determination, struggle, honesty, and humbleness.
He has taught me about important factors that lead to success - studies,
behaviour, career opportunities and family. He spreads positive vibes in
our family, encourages us to work hard, and motivates us to become an
ideal human being.

- Tulip Gyawali, Minbhawan

* The quality that I greatly adore and treasure about my father is his
ability to forgive. He holds no grudges, and easily forgives even those
people who misbehaved with him. He also taught me to practice forgiving
those individuals and incidents from our lives and move forward with
courage and determination. I do not know how much I have been able to
follow this in my life though I would wish to imbibe this quality.

- Saikat Kumar Basu, Lethbridge, Canada

* My father is a kind person. He does whatever I tell him to do, and I
also do whatever he tells me. He buys me expensive goodies when I
perform well in my exams and I impress him by paying him back for what
he does for me. This week, he bought me a set of markers that had 50
different colours. Father's Day is coming and I am planning a big
surprise for him. There will be cards for him made by my sisters and me.
I hope my father will have a nice time on Father's Day, not like last
time when he had to go to work. When I grow up, I wish to be as kind as
him.

- Dipti Gurung

* I have learnt from my father to be honest, polite, being myself, smile
a lot, and cherish our potential. Whatever I am today, and all of my
satisfaction in life is all because of my father. I strongly believe
that he is a special gift as a parent to everyone.

- Dikshya Giri

* I feel proud of my father as he has a positive influence in shaping my
career. He has always been by my side whenever I have wanted to march
ahead to become a successful person. He also teaches me to be serious in
what I do, without being lazy. On top of that, he has always remained
practical and not emotional in terms of making me a person who I really
am. I am blessed to have such a father who has been my role model
throughout my life. Hence, I appreciate my father for whatever he has
done for me.

- Pratik Shrestha, Buddhanagar, Baneshwore

* I cannot imagine my life without my father - our bond is beyond
special. My father is my role model, teacher, friend and whatever I can
say him. He struggles and works hard for our family. After growing up, I
wish to be like him. My father has always inspired me to work hard and
achieve success. I believe that I am the luckiest person to have my
father with me. If I could imitate him in the future and keep my family
happy, I would consider my life to be a success.

- Smriti Dumre

* My father understands my every grief and pats my head as
encouragement. He is my role model forever. I vividly remember those
days when I was in Class V and I was terrible at drawing. But he always
helped me through all of my sketches. I am always grateful for his
efforts to push me towards becoming a better person. So, every second of
my life is influenced by my dad's optimistic ideas.

- Shristi Parajuli, Pokhara

* My father has influenced me in a positive way. I failed in five
subjects of second terminal exams when I was in the tenth grade. My
mother scolded me and was nasty to me. But my father came into my room
after a few hours and asked me to find the list of world's successful
people on Google. I followed his instructions and realised that those
people also had failed several times. One thing I realised then is that
they never stopped learning. My father motivated me that I should never
give up despite failures. I started to study well and have never failed
since then. My dad always exudes positive vibes. I think children will
become more close to their parents if they try to understand them or
else they get demotivated, depressed and introverted in nature. Parents
should be friendly with their us. I am happy that my father is just like
my best friend and he understands me.

- Tanupa Patel, Birgunj

* My father has always been my support. He tells me to do things of my
interest and give my best. He advises me to keep moving forward in life.
He is full of qualities of a good father and a great human being. What I
like about him is that he is hardworking and helpful. So, I wish to
resemble him. He works a lot in order to keep us happy and comfortable.
He helps others in need selflessly. He has influenced me to be
independent. He says that he can guide me and support my needs but it is
up to me to fulfil my dreams.

- Shiksha Pokhrel

* My father was the best person I have ever known in my life. He was so
generous that everyone liked him. He was so cool and understanding. I do
not remember him raising hand on me ever. When I committed mistakes, he
used to help me realise my mistake and make sure that I do not repeat it
again. He helped me a lot in my studies. I will always consider his
words and lessons even though he is not here with us physically now. My
memories with my father are still fresh within me. He is forever alive
in my heart.

- Subhamitta

* My dad is an amazing man. He is a strong soldier. And we are like
friends. I enjoy listening to his struggles and getting inspired. He
holds a lot of dignity and is a self-made man. He retired three years go
and due to his influence, I also wish to be an army officer of Nepal. I
have a strong feeling of patriotism due to him. I wish to make him proud
one day. He motivates us to be better every day.

- Sumitra Magrati, Aahale, Gorkha

GUNTUR: A day before chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu sits on a
'deeksha' in New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday accused
him of splurging public funds for political gains. He demanded that
Naidu should make public the accounts of his spending before reaching
Delhi for the agitation against the Centre.Modi, who was in Guntur on a
whirlwind tour amidst criticism by the ruling TDP of neglecting Andhra
Pradesh, launched Rs 9200 crore projects in the state. The Prime
Minister faced protocol breach as the state administration ignored him.
Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu decided to stay away from extending
the protocol courtesies to PM Modi.

Officials too joined Naidu. Chief secretary Anil Chandra Punetha and
other senior officials confined themselves to according welcome to PM
Narendra Modi at Vijayawada airport, and skipped the official programme
in Guntur.In a scathing attack on Naidu, Modi said that TDP supremo is
literally spending sleepless nights for the past few months as he had
indulged in large-scale misuse of central funds. The fight between Modi
and Naidu, which was at a political level, took a personal turn on
Sunday. While Modi preferred to address Naidu as the father of Nara
Lokesh, Naidu retorted wondering if Modi would admit Jashodaben as his
wife. The TDP and Left parties observed a black day and organised
protests with black pots symbolising empty promises. Modi had brought
two pots - one with earth and other with Yamuna water - during the
foundation stone laying ceremony of Amaravati four years ago.During his
maiden visit to the state after TDP walking out of the NDA, Prime
Minister Narendra Modi declared that Naidu is going to lose the next
election for sure. Modi completely dedicated his address to undress his
former ally's untrustworthy attitude.Addressing a public meeting here on
Sunday, Narendra Modi dubbed Naidu as the most opportunistic leader on
the earth. He ripped through Naidu's strategies and u-turns during his
long political career. "Naidu has never won a second term in succession
in his life. Fearing a certain defeat in the next elections, Naidu had
decided to join Congress-led Mahakutami by burying the party founder
NTR's ideals on fighting with Congress," Modi said. He said that NTR had
vowed to make the country Congress Mukth Bharath, but Naidu had gone to
the Naamdars (referring to the famed Congress family) and bowed down his
head for political gains.Referring to Naidu's comments on seniority,
Modi said that, there was no dispute about the issue. "We have given him
due respect as a senior leader. But, Naidu proved that he is more senior
in switching sides, speaking lies, back-stabbing his own father-in-law,
losing elections and making monies." The Prime Minister said that Naidu
promised to build a world class capital city in Amaravati but engaged in
building his own son Lokesh's career. He said that he took another
u-turn to make the "sun rise" state into "son rise" state.Modi said that
people have realized the gimmicks of Naidu and decided to send him home
packed. He charged that Naidu was misleading the people on Centre's
assistance to the state and spreading lies against the Centre. "Naidu
had only put the TDP's stickers on Central funds," criticized Modi.He
said that Naidu is worried about giving accounts of every paise released
from the Centre as Chowkidar (Modi) would never allow leaders to pocket
public money. He said that Naidu spoke the truth on only one issue where
he said that Modi does not know how to create wealth. "Yes, Naidu is
right because I have never engaged in creation of my own wealth. Naidu
is busy in building his own wealth right from Amaravati to Polavaram,"
fumed Modi.The Prime Minister predicted that Naidu losing the next
election is certain and the state would be made corruption free once
after ousting Naidu from power. Referring to the Special Category Status
(SCS), Modi said that Centre had sanctioned special financial assistance
package to Andhra Pradesh after consulting the state government way back
in 2016. He said that the state government had also appreciated the
package and thanked the Centre through a resolution in the Assembly for
giving the package."Naidu took u-turn and started demanding SCS to cover
up his failures," said PM Modi. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

As physical distancing occurs, virtual intimacy emerges. Transition from
physical to virtual reality is the great demand of the new normal. Young
entrepreneurs, startups, micro, small and medium scale enterprises are
deeply affected by the global pandemic situation of COVID-19.

Startups and young entrepreneurs are the most inexperienced in the
business world. They are working hard and struggling to face the new
harsh realities of the new era. As the renowned startups leader and
mentor Seth Bannon says, lessons learnt from the past and guidance from
mentors are truly essential for these young entrepreneurs and startups
to overcome the tough problems and take advantage of the emerging
opportunities in the new normal phenomenon.

In light of this background, the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(SAARC CCI) has embarked upon a free webinar series for startups and
young entrepreneurs to help them overcome deep challenges, effectively
face the economic shocks, recover from failures and improve their
startups in the new economic realities of the new normal.

The first webinar in the series was held on 18 May and the second
webinar was held on 2 June. The third and fourth webinars will be held
on 10 and 17 June respectively. Above all, a number of important
webinars are in the pipeline covering all major aspects of startups from
theoretical perspectives to practical dimensions along with innovative
strategies to deal with difficult situations like novel corona.

The webinar series is organised in collaboration with the Friedrich
Naumann Foundation for Freedom (FNF). Renowned mentors from India,
Subramanian Chandramouli, International Sales Trainer, and Saravana
Mani, Global Head of Innovation Kmart Group Australia, are conducting
the webinar sessions for startups. Young entrepreneurs from Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are
taking part in the series of startup webinars.

Prior to this webinar series for startups, SAARC CCI had already
organised a series of startup boot camps in various countries of South
Asia, i.e. Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, stating
from April to December 2019.

In line with the recommendations of SAARC Startup Vision Summit 2018,
held in India, the series of SAARC CCI boot camps and the webinar series
are being organised with the intention of developing a mechanism to
ensure cross border learning, exposure and mentoring for startups and to
strengthen startup ecosystems across South Asia, especially in the South
Asian countries with no startup ecosystems or least developed startup
ecosystems.

It has been significant that SAARC CCI has so far been trained and
mentored over 350 young entrepreneurs from South Asian countries during
the series of startup webinars and boot camps. All these young ventures
are extremely happy about the training programs and continue to take
part in SAARC CCI activities.

Startups plays a pivotal role in an economy significantly contributing
to the economic growth. Startups generate new employment opportunities
for passionate young people.

Moreover, startups are a salient component of economic dynamism
stimulating innovation and injecting competition. It is apparent that
startups are the driving force behind structural change in South Asian
countries.

Therefore, it is expected that the series of SAARC CCI webinars and boot
camps will indeed be instrumental in developing effective startup
ecosystems in South Asian nations thereby contributing to the economic
dynamism and progressive changes in the region.

ABSTRACT

Many developing countries have resorted to BOT (build–operate–transfer)
scheme for infrastructure development. Although BOT scheme would bring
significant benefits to developing countries, it conceals structural
vulnerabilities. This has made the private sector hesitant in investing
in BOT projects unless key risks are covered by governments under public
private partnership (PPP) arrangements. Having seen this problem,
developing countries have offered overly lucrative guarantees to private
investors, which have ended up with huge payments at a later stage. The
purpose of this study is to find a kind of PPP measures which would be
effective in getting the private sector to participate in BOT projects
with little public-sector support being offered. For this purpose, a
cross-country comparison was conducted, which has identified that some
of PPP measures adopted in India are effective. Although their
applicability to other developing countries is limited, it was found
possible if combined with appropriate measures and confined to right
sectors.

FULL TEXT

Introduction

Faced with chronic capacity shortage of infrastructure, a number of
developing countries have resorted to the public private partnership
(PPP) for infrastructure development. The specific type of PPP widely
used in developing countries is build–operate–transfer (BOT), rather
than “Unitary Payment” or “Annuity” Scheme. This is due in part to the
fact that the BOT type arrangement is more suited for large investment
projects for economic infrastructure, while the unitary payment or
annuity scheme is more suited for social infrastructure such as
hospitals or schools. In developing countries, a higher priority has
often been given to economic infrastructure, rather than social
infrastructure.

Although the BOT plays an important role for infrastructure development,
private investors are reluctant in investing in BOT projects in
developing countries because of greater risks associated with BOT
arrangements. Unless commercial risks are substantially covered by the
governments, the private sector is unwilling to invest in BOT type
projects. This trend has become even clearer after Asian Financial
Crisis of 1997, which had made foreign investors more cautious about
investing in risky projects in developing countries.

Cognizant of this problem, developing countries have started offering
leniently structured guarantees to the private investors. As these
guarantees are often very extensive, the BOT scheme is now known as PPP.
As guarantees provide an easy way-out of deadlocked negotiation with
investors, the developing countries can overly resort to the guarantees.
Although these offers may initially help the developing governments to
get the contracts concluded faster, this approach may haunt later the
governments by huge obligations to pay for the losses to be suffered by
the private sector. There have been a number of cases in which
developing countries have ended up with a huge amount of payments having
been made to the private sector. A typical case is Mexican highway
development program implemented under the BOT scheme from 1989 to 1994,
which had paid $7 billion of bailout for the program of $13 billion.

This experience clearly indicates the need to pay an attention not only
to the incentive side of BOT investments but also to their consequence
on the fiscal balance of the future. The real challenge facing
developing countries is how to secure private sector participation in
BOT projects without committing too much for future losses to be
suffered by the private sector.

Scope of the Study

Before getting into the detailed analysis, it is useful to clarify what
type of PPP is primarily discussed in this article. When referring to
PPP, it encompasses several types of PPP, including (a) unitary-payment
scheme which are often applied to public service concession, (b)
availability-payment scheme (or annuity scheme), (c) PPP arrangement
which supplements the vulnerabilities of BOT scheme, and (d) a
straightforward BOT scheme.

PPP can be schematically categorized by two sets of criteria. The first
criterion is whether it is investment-oriented or service-oriented. The
second criterion is which side of the parties would primarily cover
commercial risks, between the government and the private sector. Based
on these two criteria, the relative positions of the above four types of
PPP can be illustrated as follows (Figure 1). Among these four types of
PPP, this article will primarily focus on the BOT type PPP which is
indicated by the dark red.

Purpose of the Research

The primary purpose of the research is to identify a kind of PPP
measures which will be effective in securing private sector
participation, but do not necessitate the large amount of later payments
to cover future losses to be incurred by the private investors.

To achieve this objective, the research will be conducted in the
following sequence:

Identification of structural vulnerabilities of BOT scheme

Cross-country comparison to find those PPP measures which were designed
to address these vulnerabilities identified through the above analysis

Examination of cost-effectiveness of each of the PPP measures thus
identified through the above exercise

Comparison of several countries in terms of cost-effectiveness of each
PPP system so as to identify what country is comparatively successful in
this endeavor

If one country is found successful in introducing cost-effective PPP
system, the identification of the underlying factors which have enabled
that specific country to develop such a PPP system.

Significance of the Study

Although there are a number of studies on the PPP, most of the studies
have focused on the evaluation of performance of PPP projects/programs
with an aim to learn lessons from failed or success projects/programs
(Cuttaree, 2008). A general evaluation of the BOT scheme is positive
because combining construction to operation has provided BOT developers
with a stronger incentive for higher efficiency and reduction of the
life cycle costs of projects/programs (Fisher & Babbar, 2002). Papers
also indicated that, in spite of this advantage, many projects failed
due to overly concessional contractual agreements or unrealistic
implementation schedule.

Another type of the studies which have been carried out on the PPP is an
analysis of the PPP system of a specific country, discussing legal
frameworks, risk allocation, and/or institutional arrangements. These
studies have stressed the importance of creating such legal frameworks
or institutional environments which are conducive to the private sector
investments, but few papers exist that look into the negative side of
pro-investment policy or incentive measures.

Although relatively rare, there are some studies conducting
cross-country comparisons of PPP systems, but most of them are merely
descriptive so as to help their audience gain insight on varying
features of the PPP systems employed (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2007). In
contrast, this article focuses on finding how those countries which have
been selected for cross-country comparison have dealt with the
vulnerability issue of the BOT scheme under PPP arrangements, which
clearly goes further that previous research, which typically was just
descriptions of PPP systems of various countries.

The main contribution of this study is shedding light on the possible
consequences of a variety of incentive measures, which could require a
major outlay of compensation by the government in later stages. The
article is intended to provide governments with some ideas on possible
measures that would enable them to avoid being trapped in this manner. A
further contribution of this study is that an increasing number of
governments can be in a better negotiating position with possible
private sector investors in the finalization of contracts.

Identification of Vulnerabilities of BOT

Although the BOT offers a potentially lucrative option for both
governments and developers, it conceals structural vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities are stemmed from the original design f the BOT
scheme.

Genesis of BOT Scheme

In 1983, Motherland Party of Turkey led by Turgut Ozal won the general
election with a promise of delivering infrastructure in an accelerated
manner, but Ozal Administration found it difficult to deliver this
promise due to the lack of national budget for this purpose. Having seen
the situation, European construction industry extended a helping hand to
the Administration with a proposal that, instead of the Government, they
would build infrastructure without charging the government for the cost.
Furthermore, they would maintain and operate for decades and eventually
transfer back those infrastructure facilities to the government. Only
condition attached to his proposal is they should be allowed to charge
users for their use of infrastructure facilities they constructed.

This proposal was very attractive for the Government, but how this
enticing proposal has been made possible? Before answering this
question, the above concept of BOT would be rephrased in the following
manner so as to link it to the arguments to be developed later: Once a
winner for the project is selected through the competitive bidding or on
a sole source basis, the private investors would be given an exclusive
right (concession) to operate infrastructure facilities in a
monopolistic or semi-monopolistic manner with permission to charge users
for their services. Once the concession is awarded, these private
investors, i.e. a consortium of private investors, would form a legal
entity, Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which is solely dedicated for the
development and subsequent operation of the project. The SPV would then
secure loans by themselves from financiers without offering collateral
or any other securities to financiers, but only through the business
plan which demonstrates financial viability of the project, more exactly
positive free cash flow (non-recourse finance).1

The above definition is intended to elucidate three key elements of BOT,
namely, (a) nonrecourse finance, (b) public service concession, and (c)
special purpose vehicle (SPV). These three elements constitute the
essential elements of the BOT scheme, but at the same time, they form as
root causes of vulnerabilities.

Nonrecourse finance

A central trick to the BOT concept was the application of the concept of
“project finance,” or “nonrecourse finance” to infrastructure projects.
The project finance has been fitted well for energy projects, but not
for other infrastructure projects such as ports, rail, or toll roads, as
the former has off-takers for those products to be delivered later by
the projects. Long term contracts to be concluded with off-takers would
help BOT operators reduce commercial risks entailing the future revenue
stream. A real world example for the application of the project finance
approach is North Sea Oil Projects explored in 1970s to which BP, Shell,
and other oil majors had committed to purchase all of the products to be
delivered by the Project. In contrast, typical infrastructure projects
such as toll road projects do not have any committed purchaser for the
services to be delivered by those infrastructure facilities. This
twisted application of the project finance concept to infrastructure
projects is the main factor which has enabled this enticing arrangement
to be materialized.

Public service concession

Public service concession is another key element enabling the BOT scheme
to take off. The concession scheme has long been employed when the
government decides to delegate the provision of the public services to
the private sector. The first recorded example of the public service
concession was a water distribution project for the City of Paris in
which concession was granted to Perier Brothers in 1782 (Walker & Smith,
1995). This project was followed by dozens of similar projects in 19th
century in France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Germany.

Under the public concession scheme, the private sector is given an
exclusive right to operate government’s facilities for the provision of
service to the general public. As this type of service falls under the
public domain, the private operator is requested to provide services in
accordance with public service obligations as stipulated in concession
agreements. When the above concession comes to an end, the facilities
must be returned to the government. This concept of returning the assets
to the government appears to have been incorporated in the BOT scheme
under the term “Transfer.”

The difference between traditional public service concession and BOT
concession is the shift of emphasis from service-orientation to
investment-orientation. Under the BOT scheme, while the private sector
is obliged to construct facilities, the private sector is, in turn,
allowed to charge users with fees for the service provision of
infrastructure thus constructed. Although the private sector would be
able to set prices at their preferred level, this pricing freedom would
often be compromised by the intervention of the public authority. If the
concessionaire charges users beyond the deemed affordability, the
government may intervene. Meanwhile, if the intervention by the
authority is excessive, this can jeopardize the commercial viability of
the private operation. This means that the pricing freedom would be
always exposed to the potential risk of excessive regulation by the
government, which is another source of the vulnerability of BOT
operations.

SPV

The above two concepts were wrapped by one legal device, that is, SPV.
Once a SPV is established, it serves as a legal protection against
financiers for immediate payback of the loans.

Procedurally, when a consortium of project proponents won a contract,
they form a SPV to which project proponents (often called sponsors)
would make equity investments; in other words, they would become
shareholders of the SPV. A portion of initial capital expenditures
(often 10%-30%) would come from equity investments, but the rest of
capital expenditures would be covered by borrowing from banks and/or
other financiers. Although real beneficiaries of these loans are project
proponents or sponsors, they are not the borrowers, but the SPV is. When
the project is feared to fail, the lenders would immediately request
payback of outstanding balance of loans to SPV but not to project
proponents or sponsors, as they are not borrowers legally.

A more important but often overlooked benefit of using the SPV is that
it enables project proponents to be paid much faster than usual time
table of the BOT project payments, that is, at the time of delivery of
equipment/services (Note. One of the main purposes of getting involved
in BOT project is that the project proponents intend to sell their
equipment or system to the project and to be paid from the project). If
the BOT project is executed directly by project proponents, they would
not be paid soon, but need to wait for a while until the BOT project
generates “free cash flow.” However, this SPV arrangement would enable
project proponents to be paid, based on the subcontracts which had been
concluded with the SPV. It should be noted that project sponsors are in
a position to influence the procurement decision by the SPV.

This structure is a reason why financiers would become extremely
cautious about financing BOT projects. When the project has failed, the
resultant default would directly hit lenders. Essence of financing is
the willingness to take this risk in exchange of earning higher interest
from the borrowers. To prevent this from happening, banks often insist
on the inclusion of several clauses in the loan agreements, such as
“step-in rights” clause, “claw-back” clause, and “escrow-account”. This
extreme cautiousness of the financiers toward the SPV arrangement would
make hard contract negotiation between SPV and financiers, which may
lead to the failure to reach financial closure in a reasonable time
frame.

Three vulnerabilities identified from the above analyses

The above analysis has enabled us to identify the three root causes of
vulnerability of BOT scheme as enumerated below.

Uncertainty in future revenue of infrastructure projects

Potential intervention by the government in pricing with resultant
difficulty in cost recovery

Difficulty in securing finance for BOT projects due to the
tilted-structure of the SPV toward project proponents

Cross-Country Comparison of PPP Systems

Having identified major vulnerabilities of the BOT scheme, these
elements would be used as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of
the PPP systems of selected countries as the most important elements of
the PPP scheme is how to overcome the vulnerabilities of the BOT scheme.
The reason for taking this approach is author’s belief that the PPP was
essentially devised to revitalize the BOT scheme by covering its
vulnerabilities with government supports.

Selection of Countries for Comparison

For conducting cross-country comparison of the PPP systems, three
countries, Chile, Korea, and India, have been selected since these three
countries register higher amount of PPP investments per GDP (Figure 2).
In addition, these three countries are well known for their excellent
track-records of implementation of the PPP programs, together with
policy frameworks.

Chilean PPP System

Overview

Chile is the first developing country that has successfully implemented
PPP programs (Although Mexico had started earlier, it had ended up with
a major failure with massive bailout extended to developers and
financiers). Faced with huge investment needs for the development of
highway networks, the Government of Chile (GoC) decided to get the
private sector to participate in both development and operations. For
this reason, Special Decree of No. 164 (called “Concession Law”) was
enacted in 1991, which was supplemented by Special Decree of No. 900 in
1996 and later by Special Decree of No. 956 in 1997 (Lorenzen &
Barrientos, 2001). Having the legal framework been in place, GoC
launched a major highway program on a PPP basis. It is a 2,000 km
intercity concession program, which started in 1994 with award of 12
contracts by 1998. The estimated amount of investment was US$3.3
billion.

A central feature of Chilean PPP is the active participation of foreign
contractors. Attracted by the policy framework, together with procedural
transparency with regard to bidding and bid evaluation, a number of
foreign contractors from Spain and Mexico actively participated in the
biddings. Among 12 winning bidders who had participated in the above
2,000 km intercity highway program, 11 were either foreign contractors
or joint ventures.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Chilean PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoC.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, GoC has introduced minimum income
guarantee (MIC). MIC was that, if the actual income to be raised from
the project has failed to reach the originally projected target of
income, the Government would pay the difference between the projected
and actual income. It should be, however, noted that the Government
would not pay the entire difference between the projected income and the
actual income, but only pay the difference of 70% of the projected
income and the actual income. This means that the Chilean MIC is
primarily intended to provide lenders with assurance for the payment of
debt services as the loans usually cover 70% of the project cost similar
amount.

Another mitigation measure the GoC has taken was least present value of
the revenue (LPVR). The LPVR is that the concession would end when the
project has generated the expected present value of the accumulated
revenue discounted by the predetermined discount rate. Under the LPVR,
when the traffic is lower than projected, the period of concession would
be extended longer than the originally agreed. This would enable the
project company to recover the cost of the project.

Difficulty in cost recovery

The possible restriction by the government on price setting is one of
the major concerns for the private sector, particularly in those
countries with high inflation. The GoC has come up with such an
indexation system which would allow the project company to increase user
charges in proportion to the speed of inflation (measured by Consumer
Price Index [CPI]).

Difficulty in securing long-term loans

As seen above, one of the feature of Chilean PPP is the dominance of
foreign contractors. For those contractors, a major stumbling block is
the currency mismatch. Although the road project would earn its revenue
from local currency, foreign project companies often mobilize funds from
foreign financiers or through Euro-currency markets. Cognizant of the
importance of mitigating the adverse impact of FX fluctuation, the GoC
has come up with an exchange-risk guarantee system. If local currency
has been depreciated more than 10%, the government would cover the
difference.

Another different financing system was mono-line service. Although this
is not direct support by the government, its system has facilitated the
project company to mobilize the fund from the capital market. Its basic
mechanism is that internationally reputed financial insurance companies
such as MBIA or XL Capital would provide subscribers of project bonds
with unconditional and irrevocable guarantees for the payment of
interests and principle in the case of default of bonds. As these
financial insurance companies are often rated AAA, project bonds
themselves would also be rated similarly. An underlying factor for the
use of this system is the Government policy on banking sector. In Chile,
banks were not allowed to lend more than 15% of the total cost of green
field projects. Instead of relaxing banking regulation, the GoC has
chosen to allow project developers to raise funds from capital markets
through issuance of infrastructure bonds. Since then, infrastructure
bonds have become a popular method for raising funds from capital
markets. In the case of the abovementioned 2,000 km intercity road
program, seven out of 12 projects secured funds through issuance of
bonds wrapped by “mono-line services.”

Korean PPP System

Overview

Although Korea has started its PPP scheme later than Chile, its scale of
investment has surpassed that of Chile and other developing countries by
a large margin. The legal framework of Korean PPP system has evolved
over years through the enactment of a series of legislations, starting
from the “1994 Act for Private Capital Inducement Promotion” through the
“1998 Act for Private Participation in Infrastructure” to the “2005 Act
for Public Private Partnership in Infrastructure (often referred to as
PPP Act).” According to Korean Development Institute (KDI; 2014), the
PPP investment peaked in 2007 both in terms of the amount of investments
and the number of projects.

Having established a legal framework, PPP has now become a mainstream
method of infrastructure development in Korea, covering 17% of the total
investment for nation’s infrastructure. Transition from the conventional
public procurement to the PPP-based procurement has been underpinned by
the strong institutional support provided by Private Infrastructure
Investment Management Center (PIMAC). PIMAC, which was established in
1998, has played an instrumental role in popularizing the PPP scheme in
Korea. Its main functions include (a) conducting researches associated
with PPP, together with provision of advice on structuring PPP; (b)
assessment/appraisal of the government-sponsored PPP projects; and (c)
provision of assistance to government agencies in negotiation with the
private sector PPP developers.

Another feature of Korean PPP is the active participation of business
conglomerates (Chaebols). Because of their involvement, the sizes of the
PPP projects have been made much greater. The average size of contract
packages of PPP projects in Korea is $450 million, which is much greater
than those of Chile (which is $262 million) and India (which is $156
million). Participation of Chaebols has enabled the Government of Korea
(GoK) to implement infrastructure programs in an expeditious manner, but
it has disadvantage as well. The negotiation has been made much longer
and more complicated, which is due to the tag of war between equally
powerful two negotiating parties.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Korean PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoK.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, Korea employed minimum revenue
guarantee (MRG), a system similar to MIC in Chile, for the period of
1998 to 2009, but this was replaced by Investment Risk Sharing System
(IRSS) because of the abuse of MRG by the private sector investors.
Project proponents tend to overstate the forecasted level of demand so
as to receive a greater amount of compensation at a later stage (KDI,
2014). The IRSS system was devised in 2009 based on this experience.
Under the IRSS, the upper limit of compensation per year is set in
advance at a level that would have been incurred if the project is
implemented by the public sector. An important element of this approach
is that this upper limit is determined by the procuring authority, but
not by the bidder or by the private sector. Thus, there is no
possibility for the private sector to maneuver or overstate the
prospective level of demands. Since then, IRSS has become a main
instrument for dealing with demand uncertainty in Korea.

Difficulty in cost recovery

To deal with price escalation, the GoK has instituted full indexation.
Under the full indexation, if the costs are increased due to the
inflation, the user charges or tolls are permitted to be increased at
the same rate as that of inflation. This provides investors with comfort
for committing their funds to the projects. Additional measure that the
GoK has taken was to allow the project company to undertake
side-business as a part of the project. This has enabled the project
company to supplement their revenue by real estate revenue. Korean
standard concession agreements have incorporated this measure.

Difficulty in securing the long-term loans

To facilitate finance for PPP projects, the GoK has provided loan
guarantees to financiers. Guarantees have been provided under a
self-managed fund, called Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Fund. Although
this fund is state-run, subscribers of guarantee have to pay premium or
fee to the fund.

Indian PPP System

Overview

After several years of experiments on PPP projects in the road sector,
the Government of India (GoI) decided in 2005 to introduce the PPP
system as a principal modality of developing infrastructure. The
decision was made by Committee of Infrastructure headed by the Prime
Minister without formulation of relevant laws or acts. This is rather
unique arrangement in the Indian decision-making system, in which the
executive body of the government would play a major role. Many of the
policy decisions have been made by bureaucrats called Indian
Administrative Service (IAS) officers without seeking legislative
endorsement or enactment by laws. The PPP system was also made in such
as manner based on policy papers developed by IAS officers. Because of
this feature, these officers were able to develop highly sophisticated
and complicated policy scheme without considering possible political
repercussions.

Another unique element with the Indian PPP system is a strong banking
sector. Unlike Chile and Korea, the Indian bond market has been
underdeveloped, thus major providers of funds for infrastructure
development has been the banking sector (51% of the necessary funds for
infrastructure; Khan, 2012). Under such a circumstance, it would be more
effective if the capacity of the banking sector is to be utilized to its
fullest extent. “Take-out finance” reviewed earlier was exactly designed
for this purpose.

Meanwhile, India’s PPP market is characterized by little participation
of foreign contractors in the road sector. Although there is some
foreign participation by foreign contractors, the extent of their
participation is much less, compared with other countries. For the 10
years from 2003 to 2012, the number of projects with foreign contractor
participation is 35, representing just 15% of the total national highway
projects in India (226 projects), most of which are contractors from
Malaysia, Russia, and China. This makes a keen contrast to Chile, where
more than 90% of the projects have been implemented by foreign
contractors.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Indian PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoI.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, the GoI has introduced a “flexible
concession period system.” This has enabled the Government to compensate
possible losses to be suffered by the private project companies without
spending their own money. This scheme is that, if the actual demand has
failed to reach the projected level of demand, the concessionaire would
be able to get the concession period to be extended. Model Concession
Agreement (MCA) of India stipulated that, when “Actual Average Traffic
has fallen short of the Target Traffic by more than 2.5%, the concession
period is extended at the pace of 1.5% for every 1% shortfall.” An
important element of this arrangement is that it would not incur any
pecuniary obligation for the government to pay in case of revenue
shortfall.

Difficulty in cost recovery

To deal with price escalation, India has introduced Indian version of
indexation (partial indexation). Under this system, the extent of the
price adjustment is confined to absorb the changes of variable costs,
but not the changes of the entire costs. More specifically, it would
allow only 40% of the inflation to be covered by the increase of tolls,
or user charges. The rationale for this approach is that inflation only
affects variable costs, but not capital expenditures or debt-service,
both of which are sunk costs.

Difficulty in securing the long-term loans

To deal with the difficulties in financing, India introduced the
“take-out financing” system, which was primarily designed to resolve a
potential asset/liability mismatch problem, one of the deterrents for
the provision of long-term loan to the project companies. Although
borrower needs to have money of long maturity, commercial banks would
not be able to provide such a loan because of the higher risk associated
with long-term loans. India Infrastructure Finance Company Incorporated
(IIFCL) was established to fill this gap by taking out (refinance)
near-the-end-of-tenure loans earlier provided by commercial banks. If
commercial banks were able to combine their loans with the funds
committed to be provided later by the IIFCL, commercial banks would be
able to provide project companies with “virtual” longer term loans.

A unique element of this arrangement is that the IIFCL will not conduct
separate appraisal by themselves. IIFCL will simply “take out” earlier
loans, trusting on the validity of the earlier appraisal by commercial
banks. This arrangement would enable IIFCL to extend the huge amount of
refinance with a very small number of staff (actually, the current
number of IIFCL staff is less than 100). The provision of refinancing
without appraisal by IIFCL’s own appraisal may appear precarious, but it
makes sense when considered the lack of experience of the newly
recruited IIFCL staff or former government officers with regard to
appraisal of financial viability of projects.

Assessment of Cost-Effectiveness

The above cross-country comparison has identified what kinds of PPP
measures have been adopted by each of these countries in dealing with
three vulnerabilities. Having conducted these analyses, this section
would proceed to the assessment of cost-effectiveness of PPP measures.
“Cost-effectiveness” referred here is how little the government needs to
pay to get the private sector to stay in, or participate in, the PPP
projects.

Cost-Effectiveness of Individual PPP Measures

The cost-effectiveness of individual PPP measures would be assessed in
two steps. The first-step is conducted by measuring the type of loss to
be covered by a specific PPP measure, in other words, whether the entire
assets/obligations would be covered by the guarantee, or only the
difference between “before and after” a specific event would be covered.
If the entire assets/obligations would be covered, a score of 3 is
given. If the coverage is given only to the difference, a score of 2 is
given. For the loss smaller than the above two cases, a score of 1 is
given. The second step is related to the extent of coverage of the loss.
If the 100% of the loss would be covered by the guarantee, a scale of
1.0 is given. If only a part of the losses is covered, a scale of 0.5 is
given. The results of this two-step assessment were indicated in Table
1.

Cost-Effectiveness of PPP Systems of Selected Countries

Having assigned the scores of cost-effectiveness of individual PPP
measures, this section would focus on the comparison of the PPP systems
as a whole for each of the countries. This assessment would be conducted
in the following manner:

Identify the most prevalent form of the PPP measures adopted by each of
the countries to deal with three types of vulnerability in the country
in question.

Then, the weight earlier assigned for each of the individual PPP
measures would be applied to measure the cost-effectiveness of each
country’s PPP system.

The results of this analysis are as follows (see Table 2):

The above has been visually illustrated with use of a radar chart.
Figure 3 has clearly indicated that India’s PPP system is the most
cost-effective among three countries. Ideally, this analysis should have
been conducted based on a series of interviews toward PPP experts with
regard to the degree of cost-effectiveness of individual PPP measures,
but these interviews were not carried out due to time/budgetary
constraints. The above is intended to demonstrate a possible method of
comparing the cost-effectiveness of the PPP systems of selected
countries.

Underlying Factors to Enable India to Adopt Cost-Effective Measures

The above analysis indicates that India has been keeping a tight control
on the issuance of contingent liabilities. In usual context, if one
country is stingy in issuing the guarantee for the future possible
losses that country would not able to attract the private sector to
participate in PPP projects, but this did not happen in India. Why it
is? The usual answer to this question is a policy/institutional
framework instituted in India. Although this may be of one of the
factors for the successful implementation of the PPP system in India,
there are other, less noticeable, factors which have enabled India to
succeed with PPP with active participation of the private sector.

Limitation in Choices for Other Contracts Beside the BOT-Based PPP

The GoI’s decision to introduce the PPP system was decisive and sweeping
in scope. Her decision was, for example, that all National Highways
(NHs) have to be developed or upgraded under the BOT-based PPP scheme
from 2005 onward. This means that the traditional public-sector
procurement would no longer be available. In other words, if the
contractors wish to stay in the road construction business, the only
choice available for them is to bid for BOT-based PPP projects or to
become subcontractors to bigger contractors who bid for BOT-based PPP
projects. The effectiveness of this system was proved by the fact that
80% of NH construction has been conducted under BOT-based PPP with use
of the viability gap fund system, 16%, under the annuity-based PPP
system, and only 4%, under traditional public procurement.

Introduction of Measures to Facilitate the Participation of Domestic
Contractors

As seen earlier, a unique element of India’s PPP system is lesser degree
of dependence on foreign investors. This has enabled the GoI to develop
her procurement/contract systems for PPP system solely in consideration
of the needs of domestic contractors. The size of contract packages has
been made very small so that small-scale domestic contractors can bid.
The average size of the contract packages under the National Highway
Development Program (NHDP) III program was $156 million per project,2
which is much smaller than those of Chile ($262 million per project at
1996 price3) and Korea ($450 million per project4).

Another action taken by the GoI is the standardization of BOT/PPP
contracts. This specific action has significantly reduced transaction
costs associated with negotiations of contracts, a major deterrent for
domestic contractors. The GoI developed a MCA which was universally
applied to all PPP contracts. This has enabled both the government and
contractors to go without extensive negotiations. This has resulted not
only in reducing transaction costs, but also facilitated the
participation of domestic contractors in BOT-based PPP projects.

Applicability of the Above Measures to Other Developing Countries

Although the above measures are very unique to India, it is not
impossible for other developing countries to adopt if the sector in
question is those areas in which domestic contractors are available and
also those sectors whose development does not require high level of
technologies or complicated management system. India’s approach may not
be applied to electricity sectors, but it can be applied to road sector
and other similar sectors.

Conclusion

When discussing key success factors for PPP, the importance of
incorporating a proper set of incentives is often emphasized. Although
incentives are important, we should not overlook their cost implication.
Investor-oriented policy measures tend to end up with huge obligation to
pay later by the governments.

The real challenge facing developing countries is how to realize two
contradictory objectives at the same time: (a) securing private sector
participation in PPP projects, but (b) minimizing fiscal obligation to
be shouldered later. India’s PPP system clearly demonstrates that it is
possible to realize these two objectives at the same time. India has
taken a tight control over contingent liabilities, but she has still
manage to secure active participation of the private sector for PPP
projects. Their carefully crafted PPP measures have enable to make this
difficult challenge to be materialized. This would provide useful hints
to those developing countries who are trying to attract the private
sector without overly committing themselves for the coverage of the
future losses to be incurred by the private sector.

ABSTRACT

Many developing countries have resorted to BOT (build–operate–transfer)
scheme for infrastructure development. Although BOT scheme would bring
significant benefits to developing countries, it conceals structural
vulnerabilities. This has made the private sector hesitant in investing
in BOT projects unless key risks are covered by governments under public
private partnership (PPP) arrangements. Having seen this problem,
developing countries have offered overly lucrative guarantees to private
investors, which have ended up with huge payments at a later stage. The
purpose of this study is to find a kind of PPP measures which would be
effective in getting the private sector to participate in BOT projects
with little public-sector support being offered. For this purpose, a
cross-country comparison was conducted, which has identified that some
of PPP measures adopted in India are effective. Although their
applicability to other developing countries is limited, it was found
possible if combined with appropriate measures and confined to right
sectors.

FULL TEXT

Introduction

Faced with chronic capacity shortage of infrastructure, a number of
developing countries have resorted to the public private partnership
(PPP) for infrastructure development. The specific type of PPP widely
used in developing countries is build–operate–transfer (BOT), rather
than “Unitary Payment” or “Annuity” Scheme. This is due in part to the
fact that the BOT type arrangement is more suited for large investment
projects for economic infrastructure, while the unitary payment or
annuity scheme is more suited for social infrastructure such as
hospitals or schools. In developing countries, a higher priority has
often been given to economic infrastructure, rather than social
infrastructure.

Although the BOT plays an important role for infrastructure development,
private investors are reluctant in investing in BOT projects in
developing countries because of greater risks associated with BOT
arrangements. Unless commercial risks are substantially covered by the
governments, the private sector is unwilling to invest in BOT type
projects. This trend has become even clearer after Asian Financial
Crisis of 1997, which had made foreign investors more cautious about
investing in risky projects in developing countries.

Cognizant of this problem, developing countries have started offering
leniently structured guarantees to the private investors. As these
guarantees are often very extensive, the BOT scheme is now known as PPP.
As guarantees provide an easy way-out of deadlocked negotiation with
investors, the developing countries can overly resort to the guarantees.
Although these offers may initially help the developing governments to
get the contracts concluded faster, this approach may haunt later the
governments by huge obligations to pay for the losses to be suffered by
the private sector. There have been a number of cases in which
developing countries have ended up with a huge amount of payments having
been made to the private sector. A typical case is Mexican highway
development program implemented under the BOT scheme from 1989 to 1994,
which had paid $7 billion of bailout for the program of $13 billion.

This experience clearly indicates the need to pay an attention not only
to the incentive side of BOT investments but also to their consequence
on the fiscal balance of the future. The real challenge facing
developing countries is how to secure private sector participation in
BOT projects without committing too much for future losses to be
suffered by the private sector.

Scope of the Study

Before getting into the detailed analysis, it is useful to clarify what
type of PPP is primarily discussed in this article. When referring to
PPP, it encompasses several types of PPP, including (a) unitary-payment
scheme which are often applied to public service concession, (b)
availability-payment scheme (or annuity scheme), (c) PPP arrangement
which supplements the vulnerabilities of BOT scheme, and (d) a
straightforward BOT scheme.

PPP can be schematically categorized by two sets of criteria. The first
criterion is whether it is investment-oriented or service-oriented. The
second criterion is which side of the parties would primarily cover
commercial risks, between the government and the private sector. Based
on these two criteria, the relative positions of the above four types of
PPP can be illustrated as follows (Figure 1). Among these four types of
PPP, this article will primarily focus on the BOT type PPP which is
indicated by the dark red.

Purpose of the Research

The primary purpose of the research is to identify a kind of PPP
measures which will be effective in securing private sector
participation, but do not necessitate the large amount of later payments
to cover future losses to be incurred by the private investors.

To achieve this objective, the research will be conducted in the
following sequence:

Identification of structural vulnerabilities of BOT scheme

Cross-country comparison to find those PPP measures which were designed
to address these vulnerabilities identified through the above analysis

Examination of cost-effectiveness of each of the PPP measures thus
identified through the above exercise

Comparison of several countries in terms of cost-effectiveness of each
PPP system so as to identify what country is comparatively successful in
this endeavor

If one country is found successful in introducing cost-effective PPP
system, the identification of the underlying factors which have enabled
that specific country to develop such a PPP system.

Significance of the Study

Although there are a number of studies on the PPP, most of the studies
have focused on the evaluation of performance of PPP projects/programs
with an aim to learn lessons from failed or success projects/programs
(Cuttaree, 2008). A general evaluation of the BOT scheme is positive
because combining construction to operation has provided BOT developers
with a stronger incentive for higher efficiency and reduction of the
life cycle costs of projects/programs (Fisher & Babbar, 2002). Papers
also indicated that, in spite of this advantage, many projects failed
due to overly concessional contractual agreements or unrealistic
implementation schedule.

Another type of the studies which have been carried out on the PPP is an
analysis of the PPP system of a specific country, discussing legal
frameworks, risk allocation, and/or institutional arrangements. These
studies have stressed the importance of creating such legal frameworks
or institutional environments which are conducive to the private sector
investments, but few papers exist that look into the negative side of
pro-investment policy or incentive measures.

Although relatively rare, there are some studies conducting
cross-country comparisons of PPP systems, but most of them are merely
descriptive so as to help their audience gain insight on varying
features of the PPP systems employed (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2007). In
contrast, this article focuses on finding how those countries which have
been selected for cross-country comparison have dealt with the
vulnerability issue of the BOT scheme under PPP arrangements, which
clearly goes further that previous research, which typically was just
descriptions of PPP systems of various countries.

The main contribution of this study is shedding light on the possible
consequences of a variety of incentive measures, which could require a
major outlay of compensation by the government in later stages. The
article is intended to provide governments with some ideas on possible
measures that would enable them to avoid being trapped in this manner. A
further contribution of this study is that an increasing number of
governments can be in a better negotiating position with possible
private sector investors in the finalization of contracts.

Identification of Vulnerabilities of BOT

Although the BOT offers a potentially lucrative option for both
governments and developers, it conceals structural vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities are stemmed from the original design f the BOT
scheme.

Genesis of BOT Scheme

In 1983, Motherland Party of Turkey led by Turgut Ozal won the general
election with a promise of delivering infrastructure in an accelerated
manner, but Ozal Administration found it difficult to deliver this
promise due to the lack of national budget for this purpose. Having seen
the situation, European construction industry extended a helping hand to
the Administration with a proposal that, instead of the Government, they
would build infrastructure without charging the government for the cost.
Furthermore, they would maintain and operate for decades and eventually
transfer back those infrastructure facilities to the government. Only
condition attached to his proposal is they should be allowed to charge
users for their use of infrastructure facilities they constructed.

This proposal was very attractive for the Government, but how this
enticing proposal has been made possible? Before answering this
question, the above concept of BOT would be rephrased in the following
manner so as to link it to the arguments to be developed later: Once a
winner for the project is selected through the competitive bidding or on
a sole source basis, the private investors would be given an exclusive
right (concession) to operate infrastructure facilities in a
monopolistic or semi-monopolistic manner with permission to charge users
for their services. Once the concession is awarded, these private
investors, i.e. a consortium of private investors, would form a legal
entity, Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which is solely dedicated for the
development and subsequent operation of the project. The SPV would then
secure loans by themselves from financiers without offering collateral
or any other securities to financiers, but only through the business
plan which demonstrates financial viability of the project, more exactly
positive free cash flow (non-recourse finance).1

The above definition is intended to elucidate three key elements of BOT,
namely, (a) nonrecourse finance, (b) public service concession, and (c)
special purpose vehicle (SPV). These three elements constitute the
essential elements of the BOT scheme, but at the same time, they form as
root causes of vulnerabilities.

Nonrecourse finance

A central trick to the BOT concept was the application of the concept of
“project finance,” or “nonrecourse finance” to infrastructure projects.
The project finance has been fitted well for energy projects, but not
for other infrastructure projects such as ports, rail, or toll roads, as
the former has off-takers for those products to be delivered later by
the projects. Long term contracts to be concluded with off-takers would
help BOT operators reduce commercial risks entailing the future revenue
stream. A real world example for the application of the project finance
approach is North Sea Oil Projects explored in 1970s to which BP, Shell,
and other oil majors had committed to purchase all of the products to be
delivered by the Project. In contrast, typical infrastructure projects
such as toll road projects do not have any committed purchaser for the
services to be delivered by those infrastructure facilities. This
twisted application of the project finance concept to infrastructure
projects is the main factor which has enabled this enticing arrangement
to be materialized.

Public service concession

Public service concession is another key element enabling the BOT scheme
to take off. The concession scheme has long been employed when the
government decides to delegate the provision of the public services to
the private sector. The first recorded example of the public service
concession was a water distribution project for the City of Paris in
which concession was granted to Perier Brothers in 1782 (Walker & Smith,
1995). This project was followed by dozens of similar projects in 19th
century in France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Germany.

Under the public concession scheme, the private sector is given an
exclusive right to operate government’s facilities for the provision of
service to the general public. As this type of service falls under the
public domain, the private operator is requested to provide services in
accordance with public service obligations as stipulated in concession
agreements. When the above concession comes to an end, the facilities
must be returned to the government. This concept of returning the assets
to the government appears to have been incorporated in the BOT scheme
under the term “Transfer.”

The difference between traditional public service concession and BOT
concession is the shift of emphasis from service-orientation to
investment-orientation. Under the BOT scheme, while the private sector
is obliged to construct facilities, the private sector is, in turn,
allowed to charge users with fees for the service provision of
infrastructure thus constructed. Although the private sector would be
able to set prices at their preferred level, this pricing freedom would
often be compromised by the intervention of the public authority. If the
concessionaire charges users beyond the deemed affordability, the
government may intervene. Meanwhile, if the intervention by the
authority is excessive, this can jeopardize the commercial viability of
the private operation. This means that the pricing freedom would be
always exposed to the potential risk of excessive regulation by the
government, which is another source of the vulnerability of BOT
operations.

SPV

The above two concepts were wrapped by one legal device, that is, SPV.
Once a SPV is established, it serves as a legal protection against
financiers for immediate payback of the loans.

Procedurally, when a consortium of project proponents won a contract,
they form a SPV to which project proponents (often called sponsors)
would make equity investments; in other words, they would become
shareholders of the SPV. A portion of initial capital expenditures
(often 10%-30%) would come from equity investments, but the rest of
capital expenditures would be covered by borrowing from banks and/or
other financiers. Although real beneficiaries of these loans are project
proponents or sponsors, they are not the borrowers, but the SPV is. When
the project is feared to fail, the lenders would immediately request
payback of outstanding balance of loans to SPV but not to project
proponents or sponsors, as they are not borrowers legally.

A more important but often overlooked benefit of using the SPV is that
it enables project proponents to be paid much faster than usual time
table of the BOT project payments, that is, at the time of delivery of
equipment/services (Note. One of the main purposes of getting involved
in BOT project is that the project proponents intend to sell their
equipment or system to the project and to be paid from the project). If
the BOT project is executed directly by project proponents, they would
not be paid soon, but need to wait for a while until the BOT project
generates “free cash flow.” However, this SPV arrangement would enable
project proponents to be paid, based on the subcontracts which had been
concluded with the SPV. It should be noted that project sponsors are in
a position to influence the procurement decision by the SPV.

This structure is a reason why financiers would become extremely
cautious about financing BOT projects. When the project has failed, the
resultant default would directly hit lenders. Essence of financing is
the willingness to take this risk in exchange of earning higher interest
from the borrowers. To prevent this from happening, banks often insist
on the inclusion of several clauses in the loan agreements, such as
“step-in rights” clause, “claw-back” clause, and “escrow-account”. This
extreme cautiousness of the financiers toward the SPV arrangement would
make hard contract negotiation between SPV and financiers, which may
lead to the failure to reach financial closure in a reasonable time
frame.

Three vulnerabilities identified from the above analyses

The above analysis has enabled us to identify the three root causes of
vulnerability of BOT scheme as enumerated below.

Uncertainty in future revenue of infrastructure projects

Potential intervention by the government in pricing with resultant
difficulty in cost recovery

Difficulty in securing finance for BOT projects due to the
tilted-structure of the SPV toward project proponents

Cross-Country Comparison of PPP Systems

Having identified major vulnerabilities of the BOT scheme, these
elements would be used as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of
the PPP systems of selected countries as the most important elements of
the PPP scheme is how to overcome the vulnerabilities of the BOT scheme.
The reason for taking this approach is author’s belief that the PPP was
essentially devised to revitalize the BOT scheme by covering its
vulnerabilities with government supports.

Selection of Countries for Comparison

For conducting cross-country comparison of the PPP systems, three
countries, Chile, Korea, and India, have been selected since these three
countries register higher amount of PPP investments per GDP (Figure 2).
In addition, these three countries are well known for their excellent
track-records of implementation of the PPP programs, together with
policy frameworks.

Chilean PPP System

Overview

Chile is the first developing country that has successfully implemented
PPP programs (Although Mexico had started earlier, it had ended up with
a major failure with massive bailout extended to developers and
financiers). Faced with huge investment needs for the development of
highway networks, the Government of Chile (GoC) decided to get the
private sector to participate in both development and operations. For
this reason, Special Decree of No. 164 (called “Concession Law”) was
enacted in 1991, which was supplemented by Special Decree of No. 900 in
1996 and later by Special Decree of No. 956 in 1997 (Lorenzen &
Barrientos, 2001). Having the legal framework been in place, GoC
launched a major highway program on a PPP basis. It is a 2,000 km
intercity concession program, which started in 1994 with award of 12
contracts by 1998. The estimated amount of investment was US$3.3
billion.

A central feature of Chilean PPP is the active participation of foreign
contractors. Attracted by the policy framework, together with procedural
transparency with regard to bidding and bid evaluation, a number of
foreign contractors from Spain and Mexico actively participated in the
biddings. Among 12 winning bidders who had participated in the above
2,000 km intercity highway program, 11 were either foreign contractors
or joint ventures.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Chilean PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoC.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, GoC has introduced minimum income
guarantee (MIC). MIC was that, if the actual income to be raised from
the project has failed to reach the originally projected target of
income, the Government would pay the difference between the projected
and actual income. It should be, however, noted that the Government
would not pay the entire difference between the projected income and the
actual income, but only pay the difference of 70% of the projected
income and the actual income. This means that the Chilean MIC is
primarily intended to provide lenders with assurance for the payment of
debt services as the loans usually cover 70% of the project cost similar
amount.

Another mitigation measure the GoC has taken was least present value of
the revenue (LPVR). The LPVR is that the concession would end when the
project has generated the expected present value of the accumulated
revenue discounted by the predetermined discount rate. Under the LPVR,
when the traffic is lower than projected, the period of concession would
be extended longer than the originally agreed. This would enable the
project company to recover the cost of the project.

Difficulty in cost recovery

The possible restriction by the government on price setting is one of
the major concerns for the private sector, particularly in those
countries with high inflation. The GoC has come up with such an
indexation system which would allow the project company to increase user
charges in proportion to the speed of inflation (measured by Consumer
Price Index [CPI]).

Difficulty in securing long-term loans

As seen above, one of the feature of Chilean PPP is the dominance of
foreign contractors. For those contractors, a major stumbling block is
the currency mismatch. Although the road project would earn its revenue
from local currency, foreign project companies often mobilize funds from
foreign financiers or through Euro-currency markets. Cognizant of the
importance of mitigating the adverse impact of FX fluctuation, the GoC
has come up with an exchange-risk guarantee system. If local currency
has been depreciated more than 10%, the government would cover the
difference.

Another different financing system was mono-line service. Although this
is not direct support by the government, its system has facilitated the
project company to mobilize the fund from the capital market. Its basic
mechanism is that internationally reputed financial insurance companies
such as MBIA or XL Capital would provide subscribers of project bonds
with unconditional and irrevocable guarantees for the payment of
interests and principle in the case of default of bonds. As these
financial insurance companies are often rated AAA, project bonds
themselves would also be rated similarly. An underlying factor for the
use of this system is the Government policy on banking sector. In Chile,
banks were not allowed to lend more than 15% of the total cost of green
field projects. Instead of relaxing banking regulation, the GoC has
chosen to allow project developers to raise funds from capital markets
through issuance of infrastructure bonds. Since then, infrastructure
bonds have become a popular method for raising funds from capital
markets. In the case of the abovementioned 2,000 km intercity road
program, seven out of 12 projects secured funds through issuance of
bonds wrapped by “mono-line services.”

Korean PPP System

Overview

Although Korea has started its PPP scheme later than Chile, its scale of
investment has surpassed that of Chile and other developing countries by
a large margin. The legal framework of Korean PPP system has evolved
over years through the enactment of a series of legislations, starting
from the “1994 Act for Private Capital Inducement Promotion” through the
“1998 Act for Private Participation in Infrastructure” to the “2005 Act
for Public Private Partnership in Infrastructure (often referred to as
PPP Act).” According to Korean Development Institute (KDI; 2014), the
PPP investment peaked in 2007 both in terms of the amount of investments
and the number of projects.

Having established a legal framework, PPP has now become a mainstream
method of infrastructure development in Korea, covering 17% of the total
investment for nation’s infrastructure. Transition from the conventional
public procurement to the PPP-based procurement has been underpinned by
the strong institutional support provided by Private Infrastructure
Investment Management Center (PIMAC). PIMAC, which was established in
1998, has played an instrumental role in popularizing the PPP scheme in
Korea. Its main functions include (a) conducting researches associated
with PPP, together with provision of advice on structuring PPP; (b)
assessment/appraisal of the government-sponsored PPP projects; and (c)
provision of assistance to government agencies in negotiation with the
private sector PPP developers.

Another feature of Korean PPP is the active participation of business
conglomerates (Chaebols). Because of their involvement, the sizes of the
PPP projects have been made much greater. The average size of contract
packages of PPP projects in Korea is $450 million, which is much greater
than those of Chile (which is $262 million) and India (which is $156
million). Participation of Chaebols has enabled the Government of Korea
(GoK) to implement infrastructure programs in an expeditious manner, but
it has disadvantage as well. The negotiation has been made much longer
and more complicated, which is due to the tag of war between equally
powerful two negotiating parties.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Korean PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoK.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, Korea employed minimum revenue
guarantee (MRG), a system similar to MIC in Chile, for the period of
1998 to 2009, but this was replaced by Investment Risk Sharing System
(IRSS) because of the abuse of MRG by the private sector investors.
Project proponents tend to overstate the forecasted level of demand so
as to receive a greater amount of compensation at a later stage (KDI,
2014). The IRSS system was devised in 2009 based on this experience.
Under the IRSS, the upper limit of compensation per year is set in
advance at a level that would have been incurred if the project is
implemented by the public sector. An important element of this approach
is that this upper limit is determined by the procuring authority, but
not by the bidder or by the private sector. Thus, there is no
possibility for the private sector to maneuver or overstate the
prospective level of demands. Since then, IRSS has become a main
instrument for dealing with demand uncertainty in Korea.

Difficulty in cost recovery

To deal with price escalation, the GoK has instituted full indexation.
Under the full indexation, if the costs are increased due to the
inflation, the user charges or tolls are permitted to be increased at
the same rate as that of inflation. This provides investors with comfort
for committing their funds to the projects. Additional measure that the
GoK has taken was to allow the project company to undertake
side-business as a part of the project. This has enabled the project
company to supplement their revenue by real estate revenue. Korean
standard concession agreements have incorporated this measure.

Difficulty in securing the long-term loans

To facilitate finance for PPP projects, the GoK has provided loan
guarantees to financiers. Guarantees have been provided under a
self-managed fund, called Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Fund. Although
this fund is state-run, subscribers of guarantee have to pay premium or
fee to the fund.

Indian PPP System

Overview

After several years of experiments on PPP projects in the road sector,
the Government of India (GoI) decided in 2005 to introduce the PPP
system as a principal modality of developing infrastructure. The
decision was made by Committee of Infrastructure headed by the Prime
Minister without formulation of relevant laws or acts. This is rather
unique arrangement in the Indian decision-making system, in which the
executive body of the government would play a major role. Many of the
policy decisions have been made by bureaucrats called Indian
Administrative Service (IAS) officers without seeking legislative
endorsement or enactment by laws. The PPP system was also made in such
as manner based on policy papers developed by IAS officers. Because of
this feature, these officers were able to develop highly sophisticated
and complicated policy scheme without considering possible political
repercussions.

Another unique element with the Indian PPP system is a strong banking
sector. Unlike Chile and Korea, the Indian bond market has been
underdeveloped, thus major providers of funds for infrastructure
development has been the banking sector (51% of the necessary funds for
infrastructure; Khan, 2012). Under such a circumstance, it would be more
effective if the capacity of the banking sector is to be utilized to its
fullest extent. “Take-out finance” reviewed earlier was exactly designed
for this purpose.

Meanwhile, India’s PPP market is characterized by little participation
of foreign contractors in the road sector. Although there is some
foreign participation by foreign contractors, the extent of their
participation is much less, compared with other countries. For the 10
years from 2003 to 2012, the number of projects with foreign contractor
participation is 35, representing just 15% of the total national highway
projects in India (226 projects), most of which are contractors from
Malaysia, Russia, and China. This makes a keen contrast to Chile, where
more than 90% of the projects have been implemented by foreign
contractors.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Indian PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoI.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, the GoI has introduced a “flexible
concession period system.” This has enabled the Government to compensate
possible losses to be suffered by the private project companies without
spending their own money. This scheme is that, if the actual demand has
failed to reach the projected level of demand, the concessionaire would
be able to get the concession period to be extended. Model Concession
Agreement (MCA) of India stipulated that, when “Actual Average Traffic
has fallen short of the Target Traffic by more than 2.5%, the concession
period is extended at the pace of 1.5% for every 1% shortfall.” An
important element of this arrangement is that it would not incur any
pecuniary obligation for the government to pay in case of revenue
shortfall.

Difficulty in cost recovery

To deal with price escalation, India has introduced Indian version of
indexation (partial indexation). Under this system, the extent of the
price adjustment is confined to absorb the changes of variable costs,
but not the changes of the entire costs. More specifically, it would
allow only 40% of the inflation to be covered by the increase of tolls,
or user charges. The rationale for this approach is that inflation only
affects variable costs, but not capital expenditures or debt-service,
both of which are sunk costs.

Difficulty in securing the long-term loans

To deal with the difficulties in financing, India introduced the
“take-out financing” system, which was primarily designed to resolve a
potential asset/liability mismatch problem, one of the deterrents for
the provision of long-term loan to the project companies. Although
borrower needs to have money of long maturity, commercial banks would
not be able to provide such a loan because of the higher risk associated
with long-term loans. India Infrastructure Finance Company Incorporated
(IIFCL) was established to fill this gap by taking out (refinance)
near-the-end-of-tenure loans earlier provided by commercial banks. If
commercial banks were able to combine their loans with the funds
committed to be provided later by the IIFCL, commercial banks would be
able to provide project companies with “virtual” longer term loans.

A unique element of this arrangement is that the IIFCL will not conduct
separate appraisal by themselves. IIFCL will simply “take out” earlier
loans, trusting on the validity of the earlier appraisal by commercial
banks. This arrangement would enable IIFCL to extend the huge amount of
refinance with a very small number of staff (actually, the current
number of IIFCL staff is less than 100). The provision of refinancing
without appraisal by IIFCL’s own appraisal may appear precarious, but it
makes sense when considered the lack of experience of the newly
recruited IIFCL staff or former government officers with regard to
appraisal of financial viability of projects.

Assessment of Cost-Effectiveness

The above cross-country comparison has identified what kinds of PPP
measures have been adopted by each of these countries in dealing with
three vulnerabilities. Having conducted these analyses, this section
would proceed to the assessment of cost-effectiveness of PPP measures.
“Cost-effectiveness” referred here is how little the government needs to
pay to get the private sector to stay in, or participate in, the PPP
projects.

Cost-Effectiveness of Individual PPP Measures

The cost-effectiveness of individual PPP measures would be assessed in
two steps. The first-step is conducted by measuring the type of loss to
be covered by a specific PPP measure, in other words, whether the entire
assets/obligations would be covered by the guarantee, or only the
difference between “before and after” a specific event would be covered.
If the entire assets/obligations would be covered, a score of 3 is
given. If the coverage is given only to the difference, a score of 2 is
given. For the loss smaller than the above two cases, a score of 1 is
given. The second step is related to the extent of coverage of the loss.
If the 100% of the loss would be covered by the guarantee, a scale of
1.0 is given. If only a part of the losses is covered, a scale of 0.5 is
given. The results of this two-step assessment were indicated in Table
1.

Cost-Effectiveness of PPP Systems of Selected Countries

Having assigned the scores of cost-effectiveness of individual PPP
measures, this section would focus on the comparison of the PPP systems
as a whole for each of the countries. This assessment would be conducted
in the following manner:

Identify the most prevalent form of the PPP measures adopted by each of
the countries to deal with three types of vulnerability in the country
in question.

Then, the weight earlier assigned for each of the individual PPP
measures would be applied to measure the cost-effectiveness of each
country’s PPP system.

The results of this analysis are as follows (see Table 2):

The above has been visually illustrated with use of a radar chart.
Figure 3 has clearly indicated that India’s PPP system is the most
cost-effective among three countries. Ideally, this analysis should have
been conducted based on a series of interviews toward PPP experts with
regard to the degree of cost-effectiveness of individual PPP measures,
but these interviews were not carried out due to time/budgetary
constraints. The above is intended to demonstrate a possible method of
comparing the cost-effectiveness of the PPP systems of selected
countries.

Underlying Factors to Enable India to Adopt Cost-Effective Measures

The above analysis indicates that India has been keeping a tight control
on the issuance of contingent liabilities. In usual context, if one
country is stingy in issuing the guarantee for the future possible
losses that country would not able to attract the private sector to
participate in PPP projects, but this did not happen in India. Why it
is? The usual answer to this question is a policy/institutional
framework instituted in India. Although this may be of one of the
factors for the successful implementation of the PPP system in India,
there are other, less noticeable, factors which have enabled India to
succeed with PPP with active participation of the private sector.

Limitation in Choices for Other Contracts Beside the BOT-Based PPP

The GoI’s decision to introduce the PPP system was decisive and sweeping
in scope. Her decision was, for example, that all National Highways
(NHs) have to be developed or upgraded under the BOT-based PPP scheme
from 2005 onward. This means that the traditional public-sector
procurement would no longer be available. In other words, if the
contractors wish to stay in the road construction business, the only
choice available for them is to bid for BOT-based PPP projects or to
become subcontractors to bigger contractors who bid for BOT-based PPP
projects. The effectiveness of this system was proved by the fact that
80% of NH construction has been conducted under BOT-based PPP with use
of the viability gap fund system, 16%, under the annuity-based PPP
system, and only 4%, under traditional public procurement.

Introduction of Measures to Facilitate the Participation of Domestic
Contractors

As seen earlier, a unique element of India’s PPP system is lesser degree
of dependence on foreign investors. This has enabled the GoI to develop
her procurement/contract systems for PPP system solely in consideration
of the needs of domestic contractors. The size of contract packages has
been made very small so that small-scale domestic contractors can bid.
The average size of the contract packages under the National Highway
Development Program (NHDP) III program was $156 million per project,2
which is much smaller than those of Chile ($262 million per project at
1996 price3) and Korea ($450 million per project4).

Another action taken by the GoI is the standardization of BOT/PPP
contracts. This specific action has significantly reduced transaction
costs associated with negotiations of contracts, a major deterrent for
domestic contractors. The GoI developed a MCA which was universally
applied to all PPP contracts. This has enabled both the government and
contractors to go without extensive negotiations. This has resulted not
only in reducing transaction costs, but also facilitated the
participation of domestic contractors in BOT-based PPP projects.

Applicability of the Above Measures to Other Developing Countries

Although the above measures are very unique to India, it is not
impossible for other developing countries to adopt if the sector in
question is those areas in which domestic contractors are available and
also those sectors whose development does not require high level of
technologies or complicated management system. India’s approach may not
be applied to electricity sectors, but it can be applied to road sector
and other similar sectors.

Conclusion

When discussing key success factors for PPP, the importance of
incorporating a proper set of incentives is often emphasized. Although
incentives are important, we should not overlook their cost implication.
Investor-oriented policy measures tend to end up with huge obligation to
pay later by the governments.

The real challenge facing developing countries is how to realize two
contradictory objectives at the same time: (a) securing private sector
participation in PPP projects, but (b) minimizing fiscal obligation to
be shouldered later. India’s PPP system clearly demonstrates that it is
possible to realize these two objectives at the same time. India has
taken a tight control over contingent liabilities, but she has still
manage to secure active participation of the private sector for PPP
projects. Their carefully crafted PPP measures have enable to make this
difficult challenge to be materialized. This would provide useful hints
to those developing countries who are trying to attract the private
sector without overly committing themselves for the coverage of the
future losses to be incurred by the private sector.

ABSTRACT

Many developing countries have resorted to BOT (build–operate–transfer)
scheme for infrastructure development. Although BOT scheme would bring
significant benefits to developing countries, it conceals structural
vulnerabilities. This has made the private sector hesitant in investing
in BOT projects unless key risks are covered by governments under public
private partnership (PPP) arrangements. Having seen this problem,
developing countries have offered overly lucrative guarantees to private
investors, which have ended up with huge payments at a later stage. The
purpose of this study is to find a kind of PPP measures which would be
effective in getting the private sector to participate in BOT projects
with little public-sector support being offered. For this purpose, a
cross-country comparison was conducted, which has identified that some
of PPP measures adopted in India are effective. Although their
applicability to other developing countries is limited, it was found
possible if combined with appropriate measures and confined to right
sectors.

FULL TEXT

Introduction

Faced with chronic capacity shortage of infrastructure, a number of
developing countries have resorted to the public private partnership
(PPP) for infrastructure development. The specific type of PPP widely
used in developing countries is build–operate–transfer (BOT), rather
than “Unitary Payment” or “Annuity” Scheme. This is due in part to the
fact that the BOT type arrangement is more suited for large investment
projects for economic infrastructure, while the unitary payment or
annuity scheme is more suited for social infrastructure such as
hospitals or schools. In developing countries, a higher priority has
often been given to economic infrastructure, rather than social
infrastructure.

Although the BOT plays an important role for infrastructure development,
private investors are reluctant in investing in BOT projects in
developing countries because of greater risks associated with BOT
arrangements. Unless commercial risks are substantially covered by the
governments, the private sector is unwilling to invest in BOT type
projects. This trend has become even clearer after Asian Financial
Crisis of 1997, which had made foreign investors more cautious about
investing in risky projects in developing countries.

Cognizant of this problem, developing countries have started offering
leniently structured guarantees to the private investors. As these
guarantees are often very extensive, the BOT scheme is now known as PPP.
As guarantees provide an easy way-out of deadlocked negotiation with
investors, the developing countries can overly resort to the guarantees.
Although these offers may initially help the developing governments to
get the contracts concluded faster, this approach may haunt later the
governments by huge obligations to pay for the losses to be suffered by
the private sector. There have been a number of cases in which
developing countries have ended up with a huge amount of payments having
been made to the private sector. A typical case is Mexican highway
development program implemented under the BOT scheme from 1989 to 1994,
which had paid $7 billion of bailout for the program of $13 billion.

This experience clearly indicates the need to pay an attention not only
to the incentive side of BOT investments but also to their consequence
on the fiscal balance of the future. The real challenge facing
developing countries is how to secure private sector participation in
BOT projects without committing too much for future losses to be
suffered by the private sector.

Scope of the Study

Before getting into the detailed analysis, it is useful to clarify what
type of PPP is primarily discussed in this article. When referring to
PPP, it encompasses several types of PPP, including (a) unitary-payment
scheme which are often applied to public service concession, (b)
availability-payment scheme (or annuity scheme), (c) PPP arrangement
which supplements the vulnerabilities of BOT scheme, and (d) a
straightforward BOT scheme.

PPP can be schematically categorized by two sets of criteria. The first
criterion is whether it is investment-oriented or service-oriented. The
second criterion is which side of the parties would primarily cover
commercial risks, between the government and the private sector. Based
on these two criteria, the relative positions of the above four types of
PPP can be illustrated as follows (Figure 1). Among these four types of
PPP, this article will primarily focus on the BOT type PPP which is
indicated by the dark red.

Purpose of the Research

The primary purpose of the research is to identify a kind of PPP
measures which will be effective in securing private sector
participation, but do not necessitate the large amount of later payments
to cover future losses to be incurred by the private investors.

To achieve this objective, the research will be conducted in the
following sequence:

Identification of structural vulnerabilities of BOT scheme

Cross-country comparison to find those PPP measures which were designed
to address these vulnerabilities identified through the above analysis

Examination of cost-effectiveness of each of the PPP measures thus
identified through the above exercise

Comparison of several countries in terms of cost-effectiveness of each
PPP system so as to identify what country is comparatively successful in
this endeavor

If one country is found successful in introducing cost-effective PPP
system, the identification of the underlying factors which have enabled
that specific country to develop such a PPP system.

Significance of the Study

Although there are a number of studies on the PPP, most of the studies
have focused on the evaluation of performance of PPP projects/programs
with an aim to learn lessons from failed or success projects/programs
(Cuttaree, 2008). A general evaluation of the BOT scheme is positive
because combining construction to operation has provided BOT developers
with a stronger incentive for higher efficiency and reduction of the
life cycle costs of projects/programs (Fisher & Babbar, 2002). Papers
also indicated that, in spite of this advantage, many projects failed
due to overly concessional contractual agreements or unrealistic
implementation schedule.

Another type of the studies which have been carried out on the PPP is an
analysis of the PPP system of a specific country, discussing legal
frameworks, risk allocation, and/or institutional arrangements. These
studies have stressed the importance of creating such legal frameworks
or institutional environments which are conducive to the private sector
investments, but few papers exist that look into the negative side of
pro-investment policy or incentive measures.

Although relatively rare, there are some studies conducting
cross-country comparisons of PPP systems, but most of them are merely
descriptive so as to help their audience gain insight on varying
features of the PPP systems employed (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2007). In
contrast, this article focuses on finding how those countries which have
been selected for cross-country comparison have dealt with the
vulnerability issue of the BOT scheme under PPP arrangements, which
clearly goes further that previous research, which typically was just
descriptions of PPP systems of various countries.

The main contribution of this study is shedding light on the possible
consequences of a variety of incentive measures, which could require a
major outlay of compensation by the government in later stages. The
article is intended to provide governments with some ideas on possible
measures that would enable them to avoid being trapped in this manner. A
further contribution of this study is that an increasing number of
governments can be in a better negotiating position with possible
private sector investors in the finalization of contracts.

Identification of Vulnerabilities of BOT

Although the BOT offers a potentially lucrative option for both
governments and developers, it conceals structural vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities are stemmed from the original design f the BOT
scheme.

Genesis of BOT Scheme

In 1983, Motherland Party of Turkey led by Turgut Ozal won the general
election with a promise of delivering infrastructure in an accelerated
manner, but Ozal Administration found it difficult to deliver this
promise due to the lack of national budget for this purpose. Having seen
the situation, European construction industry extended a helping hand to
the Administration with a proposal that, instead of the Government, they
would build infrastructure without charging the government for the cost.
Furthermore, they would maintain and operate for decades and eventually
transfer back those infrastructure facilities to the government. Only
condition attached to his proposal is they should be allowed to charge
users for their use of infrastructure facilities they constructed.

This proposal was very attractive for the Government, but how this
enticing proposal has been made possible? Before answering this
question, the above concept of BOT would be rephrased in the following
manner so as to link it to the arguments to be developed later: Once a
winner for the project is selected through the competitive bidding or on
a sole source basis, the private investors would be given an exclusive
right (concession) to operate infrastructure facilities in a
monopolistic or semi-monopolistic manner with permission to charge users
for their services. Once the concession is awarded, these private
investors, i.e. a consortium of private investors, would form a legal
entity, Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which is solely dedicated for the
development and subsequent operation of the project. The SPV would then
secure loans by themselves from financiers without offering collateral
or any other securities to financiers, but only through the business
plan which demonstrates financial viability of the project, more exactly
positive free cash flow (non-recourse finance).1

The above definition is intended to elucidate three key elements of BOT,
namely, (a) nonrecourse finance, (b) public service concession, and (c)
special purpose vehicle (SPV). These three elements constitute the
essential elements of the BOT scheme, but at the same time, they form as
root causes of vulnerabilities.

Nonrecourse finance

A central trick to the BOT concept was the application of the concept of
“project finance,” or “nonrecourse finance” to infrastructure projects.
The project finance has been fitted well for energy projects, but not
for other infrastructure projects such as ports, rail, or toll roads, as
the former has off-takers for those products to be delivered later by
the projects. Long term contracts to be concluded with off-takers would
help BOT operators reduce commercial risks entailing the future revenue
stream. A real world example for the application of the project finance
approach is North Sea Oil Projects explored in 1970s to which BP, Shell,
and other oil majors had committed to purchase all of the products to be
delivered by the Project. In contrast, typical infrastructure projects
such as toll road projects do not have any committed purchaser for the
services to be delivered by those infrastructure facilities. This
twisted application of the project finance concept to infrastructure
projects is the main factor which has enabled this enticing arrangement
to be materialized.

Public service concession

Public service concession is another key element enabling the BOT scheme
to take off. The concession scheme has long been employed when the
government decides to delegate the provision of the public services to
the private sector. The first recorded example of the public service
concession was a water distribution project for the City of Paris in
which concession was granted to Perier Brothers in 1782 (Walker & Smith,
1995). This project was followed by dozens of similar projects in 19th
century in France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Germany.

Under the public concession scheme, the private sector is given an
exclusive right to operate government’s facilities for the provision of
service to the general public. As this type of service falls under the
public domain, the private operator is requested to provide services in
accordance with public service obligations as stipulated in concession
agreements. When the above concession comes to an end, the facilities
must be returned to the government. This concept of returning the assets
to the government appears to have been incorporated in the BOT scheme
under the term “Transfer.”

The difference between traditional public service concession and BOT
concession is the shift of emphasis from service-orientation to
investment-orientation. Under the BOT scheme, while the private sector
is obliged to construct facilities, the private sector is, in turn,
allowed to charge users with fees for the service provision of
infrastructure thus constructed. Although the private sector would be
able to set prices at their preferred level, this pricing freedom would
often be compromised by the intervention of the public authority. If the
concessionaire charges users beyond the deemed affordability, the
government may intervene. Meanwhile, if the intervention by the
authority is excessive, this can jeopardize the commercial viability of
the private operation. This means that the pricing freedom would be
always exposed to the potential risk of excessive regulation by the
government, which is another source of the vulnerability of BOT
operations.

SPV

The above two concepts were wrapped by one legal device, that is, SPV.
Once a SPV is established, it serves as a legal protection against
financiers for immediate payback of the loans.

Procedurally, when a consortium of project proponents won a contract,
they form a SPV to which project proponents (often called sponsors)
would make equity investments; in other words, they would become
shareholders of the SPV. A portion of initial capital expenditures
(often 10%-30%) would come from equity investments, but the rest of
capital expenditures would be covered by borrowing from banks and/or
other financiers. Although real beneficiaries of these loans are project
proponents or sponsors, they are not the borrowers, but the SPV is. When
the project is feared to fail, the lenders would immediately request
payback of outstanding balance of loans to SPV but not to project
proponents or sponsors, as they are not borrowers legally.

A more important but often overlooked benefit of using the SPV is that
it enables project proponents to be paid much faster than usual time
table of the BOT project payments, that is, at the time of delivery of
equipment/services (Note. One of the main purposes of getting involved
in BOT project is that the project proponents intend to sell their
equipment or system to the project and to be paid from the project). If
the BOT project is executed directly by project proponents, they would
not be paid soon, but need to wait for a while until the BOT project
generates “free cash flow.” However, this SPV arrangement would enable
project proponents to be paid, based on the subcontracts which had been
concluded with the SPV. It should be noted that project sponsors are in
a position to influence the procurement decision by the SPV.

This structure is a reason why financiers would become extremely
cautious about financing BOT projects. When the project has failed, the
resultant default would directly hit lenders. Essence of financing is
the willingness to take this risk in exchange of earning higher interest
from the borrowers. To prevent this from happening, banks often insist
on the inclusion of several clauses in the loan agreements, such as
“step-in rights” clause, “claw-back” clause, and “escrow-account”. This
extreme cautiousness of the financiers toward the SPV arrangement would
make hard contract negotiation between SPV and financiers, which may
lead to the failure to reach financial closure in a reasonable time
frame.

Three vulnerabilities identified from the above analyses

The above analysis has enabled us to identify the three root causes of
vulnerability of BOT scheme as enumerated below.

Uncertainty in future revenue of infrastructure projects

Potential intervention by the government in pricing with resultant
difficulty in cost recovery

Difficulty in securing finance for BOT projects due to the
tilted-structure of the SPV toward project proponents

Cross-Country Comparison of PPP Systems

Having identified major vulnerabilities of the BOT scheme, these
elements would be used as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of
the PPP systems of selected countries as the most important elements of
the PPP scheme is how to overcome the vulnerabilities of the BOT scheme.
The reason for taking this approach is author’s belief that the PPP was
essentially devised to revitalize the BOT scheme by covering its
vulnerabilities with government supports.

Selection of Countries for Comparison

For conducting cross-country comparison of the PPP systems, three
countries, Chile, Korea, and India, have been selected since these three
countries register higher amount of PPP investments per GDP (Figure 2).
In addition, these three countries are well known for their excellent
track-records of implementation of the PPP programs, together with
policy frameworks.

Chilean PPP System

Overview

Chile is the first developing country that has successfully implemented
PPP programs (Although Mexico had started earlier, it had ended up with
a major failure with massive bailout extended to developers and
financiers). Faced with huge investment needs for the development of
highway networks, the Government of Chile (GoC) decided to get the
private sector to participate in both development and operations. For
this reason, Special Decree of No. 164 (called “Concession Law”) was
enacted in 1991, which was supplemented by Special Decree of No. 900 in
1996 and later by Special Decree of No. 956 in 1997 (Lorenzen &
Barrientos, 2001). Having the legal framework been in place, GoC
launched a major highway program on a PPP basis. It is a 2,000 km
intercity concession program, which started in 1994 with award of 12
contracts by 1998. The estimated amount of investment was US$3.3
billion.

A central feature of Chilean PPP is the active participation of foreign
contractors. Attracted by the policy framework, together with procedural
transparency with regard to bidding and bid evaluation, a number of
foreign contractors from Spain and Mexico actively participated in the
biddings. Among 12 winning bidders who had participated in the above
2,000 km intercity highway program, 11 were either foreign contractors
or joint ventures.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Chilean PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoC.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, GoC has introduced minimum income
guarantee (MIC). MIC was that, if the actual income to be raised from
the project has failed to reach the originally projected target of
income, the Government would pay the difference between the projected
and actual income. It should be, however, noted that the Government
would not pay the entire difference between the projected income and the
actual income, but only pay the difference of 70% of the projected
income and the actual income. This means that the Chilean MIC is
primarily intended to provide lenders with assurance for the payment of
debt services as the loans usually cover 70% of the project cost similar
amount.

Another mitigation measure the GoC has taken was least present value of
the revenue (LPVR). The LPVR is that the concession would end when the
project has generated the expected present value of the accumulated
revenue discounted by the predetermined discount rate. Under the LPVR,
when the traffic is lower than projected, the period of concession would
be extended longer than the originally agreed. This would enable the
project company to recover the cost of the project.

Difficulty in cost recovery

The possible restriction by the government on price setting is one of
the major concerns for the private sector, particularly in those
countries with high inflation. The GoC has come up with such an
indexation system which would allow the project company to increase user
charges in proportion to the speed of inflation (measured by Consumer
Price Index [CPI]).

Difficulty in securing long-term loans

As seen above, one of the feature of Chilean PPP is the dominance of
foreign contractors. For those contractors, a major stumbling block is
the currency mismatch. Although the road project would earn its revenue
from local currency, foreign project companies often mobilize funds from
foreign financiers or through Euro-currency markets. Cognizant of the
importance of mitigating the adverse impact of FX fluctuation, the GoC
has come up with an exchange-risk guarantee system. If local currency
has been depreciated more than 10%, the government would cover the
difference.

Another different financing system was mono-line service. Although this
is not direct support by the government, its system has facilitated the
project company to mobilize the fund from the capital market. Its basic
mechanism is that internationally reputed financial insurance companies
such as MBIA or XL Capital would provide subscribers of project bonds
with unconditional and irrevocable guarantees for the payment of
interests and principle in the case of default of bonds. As these
financial insurance companies are often rated AAA, project bonds
themselves would also be rated similarly. An underlying factor for the
use of this system is the Government policy on banking sector. In Chile,
banks were not allowed to lend more than 15% of the total cost of green
field projects. Instead of relaxing banking regulation, the GoC has
chosen to allow project developers to raise funds from capital markets
through issuance of infrastructure bonds. Since then, infrastructure
bonds have become a popular method for raising funds from capital
markets. In the case of the abovementioned 2,000 km intercity road
program, seven out of 12 projects secured funds through issuance of
bonds wrapped by “mono-line services.”

Korean PPP System

Overview

Although Korea has started its PPP scheme later than Chile, its scale of
investment has surpassed that of Chile and other developing countries by
a large margin. The legal framework of Korean PPP system has evolved
over years through the enactment of a series of legislations, starting
from the “1994 Act for Private Capital Inducement Promotion” through the
“1998 Act for Private Participation in Infrastructure” to the “2005 Act
for Public Private Partnership in Infrastructure (often referred to as
PPP Act).” According to Korean Development Institute (KDI; 2014), the
PPP investment peaked in 2007 both in terms of the amount of investments
and the number of projects.

Having established a legal framework, PPP has now become a mainstream
method of infrastructure development in Korea, covering 17% of the total
investment for nation’s infrastructure. Transition from the conventional
public procurement to the PPP-based procurement has been underpinned by
the strong institutional support provided by Private Infrastructure
Investment Management Center (PIMAC). PIMAC, which was established in
1998, has played an instrumental role in popularizing the PPP scheme in
Korea. Its main functions include (a) conducting researches associated
with PPP, together with provision of advice on structuring PPP; (b)
assessment/appraisal of the government-sponsored PPP projects; and (c)
provision of assistance to government agencies in negotiation with the
private sector PPP developers.

Another feature of Korean PPP is the active participation of business
conglomerates (Chaebols). Because of their involvement, the sizes of the
PPP projects have been made much greater. The average size of contract
packages of PPP projects in Korea is $450 million, which is much greater
than those of Chile (which is $262 million) and India (which is $156
million). Participation of Chaebols has enabled the Government of Korea
(GoK) to implement infrastructure programs in an expeditious manner, but
it has disadvantage as well. The negotiation has been made much longer
and more complicated, which is due to the tag of war between equally
powerful two negotiating parties.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Korean PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoK.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, Korea employed minimum revenue
guarantee (MRG), a system similar to MIC in Chile, for the period of
1998 to 2009, but this was replaced by Investment Risk Sharing System
(IRSS) because of the abuse of MRG by the private sector investors.
Project proponents tend to overstate the forecasted level of demand so
as to receive a greater amount of compensation at a later stage (KDI,
2014). The IRSS system was devised in 2009 based on this experience.
Under the IRSS, the upper limit of compensation per year is set in
advance at a level that would have been incurred if the project is
implemented by the public sector. An important element of this approach
is that this upper limit is determined by the procuring authority, but
not by the bidder or by the private sector. Thus, there is no
possibility for the private sector to maneuver or overstate the
prospective level of demands. Since then, IRSS has become a main
instrument for dealing with demand uncertainty in Korea.

Difficulty in cost recovery

To deal with price escalation, the GoK has instituted full indexation.
Under the full indexation, if the costs are increased due to the
inflation, the user charges or tolls are permitted to be increased at
the same rate as that of inflation. This provides investors with comfort
for committing their funds to the projects. Additional measure that the
GoK has taken was to allow the project company to undertake
side-business as a part of the project. This has enabled the project
company to supplement their revenue by real estate revenue. Korean
standard concession agreements have incorporated this measure.

Difficulty in securing the long-term loans

To facilitate finance for PPP projects, the GoK has provided loan
guarantees to financiers. Guarantees have been provided under a
self-managed fund, called Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Fund. Although
this fund is state-run, subscribers of guarantee have to pay premium or
fee to the fund.

Indian PPP System

Overview

After several years of experiments on PPP projects in the road sector,
the Government of India (GoI) decided in 2005 to introduce the PPP
system as a principal modality of developing infrastructure. The
decision was made by Committee of Infrastructure headed by the Prime
Minister without formulation of relevant laws or acts. This is rather
unique arrangement in the Indian decision-making system, in which the
executive body of the government would play a major role. Many of the
policy decisions have been made by bureaucrats called Indian
Administrative Service (IAS) officers without seeking legislative
endorsement or enactment by laws. The PPP system was also made in such
as manner based on policy papers developed by IAS officers. Because of
this feature, these officers were able to develop highly sophisticated
and complicated policy scheme without considering possible political
repercussions.

Another unique element with the Indian PPP system is a strong banking
sector. Unlike Chile and Korea, the Indian bond market has been
underdeveloped, thus major providers of funds for infrastructure
development has been the banking sector (51% of the necessary funds for
infrastructure; Khan, 2012). Under such a circumstance, it would be more
effective if the capacity of the banking sector is to be utilized to its
fullest extent. “Take-out finance” reviewed earlier was exactly designed
for this purpose.

Meanwhile, India’s PPP market is characterized by little participation
of foreign contractors in the road sector. Although there is some
foreign participation by foreign contractors, the extent of their
participation is much less, compared with other countries. For the 10
years from 2003 to 2012, the number of projects with foreign contractor
participation is 35, representing just 15% of the total national highway
projects in India (226 projects), most of which are contractors from
Malaysia, Russia, and China. This makes a keen contrast to Chile, where
more than 90% of the projects have been implemented by foreign
contractors.

Ways to deal with these vulnerabilities under the Indian PPP system

This section would describe how those vulnerabilities identified earlier
have been handled under the PPP system of the GoI.

Uncertainty in demand

To deal with demand uncertainty, the GoI has introduced a “flexible
concession period system.” This has enabled the Government to compensate
possible losses to be suffered by the private project companies without
spending their own money. This scheme is that, if the actual demand has
failed to reach the projected level of demand, the concessionaire would
be able to get the concession period to be extended. Model Concession
Agreement (MCA) of India stipulated that, when “Actual Average Traffic
has fallen short of the Target Traffic by more than 2.5%, the concession
period is extended at the pace of 1.5% for every 1% shortfall.” An
important element of this arrangement is that it would not incur any
pecuniary obligation for the government to pay in case of revenue
shortfall.

Difficulty in cost recovery

To deal with price escalation, India has introduced Indian version of
indexation (partial indexation). Under this system, the extent of the
price adjustment is confined to absorb the changes of variable costs,
but not the changes of the entire costs. More specifically, it would
allow only 40% of the inflation to be covered by the increase of tolls,
or user charges. The rationale for this approach is that inflation only
affects variable costs, but not capital expenditures or debt-service,
both of which are sunk costs.

Difficulty in securing the long-term loans

To deal with the difficulties in financing, India introduced the
“take-out financing” system, which was primarily designed to resolve a
potential asset/liability mismatch problem, one of the deterrents for
the provision of long-term loan to the project companies. Although
borrower needs to have money of long maturity, commercial banks would
not be able to provide such a loan because of the higher risk associated
with long-term loans. India Infrastructure Finance Company Incorporated
(IIFCL) was established to fill this gap by taking out (refinance)
near-the-end-of-tenure loans earlier provided by commercial banks. If
commercial banks were able to combine their loans with the funds
committed to be provided later by the IIFCL, commercial banks would be
able to provide project companies with “virtual” longer term loans.

A unique element of this arrangement is that the IIFCL will not conduct
separate appraisal by themselves. IIFCL will simply “take out” earlier
loans, trusting on the validity of the earlier appraisal by commercial
banks. This arrangement would enable IIFCL to extend the huge amount of
refinance with a very small number of staff (actually, the current
number of IIFCL staff is less than 100). The provision of refinancing
without appraisal by IIFCL’s own appraisal may appear precarious, but it
makes sense when considered the lack of experience of the newly
recruited IIFCL staff or former government officers with regard to
appraisal of financial viability of projects.

Assessment of Cost-Effectiveness

The above cross-country comparison has identified what kinds of PPP
measures have been adopted by each of these countries in dealing with
three vulnerabilities. Having conducted these analyses, this section
would proceed to the assessment of cost-effectiveness of PPP measures.
“Cost-effectiveness” referred here is how little the government needs to
pay to get the private sector to stay in, or participate in, the PPP
projects.

Cost-Effectiveness of Individual PPP Measures

The cost-effectiveness of individual PPP measures would be assessed in
two steps. The first-step is conducted by measuring the type of loss to
be covered by a specific PPP measure, in other words, whether the entire
assets/obligations would be covered by the guarantee, or only the
difference between “before and after” a specific event would be covered.
If the entire assets/obligations would be covered, a score of 3 is
given. If the coverage is given only to the difference, a score of 2 is
given. For the loss smaller than the above two cases, a score of 1 is
given. The second step is related to the extent of coverage of the loss.
If the 100% of the loss would be covered by the guarantee, a scale of
1.0 is given. If only a part of the losses is covered, a scale of 0.5 is
given. The results of this two-step assessment were indicated in Table
1.

Cost-Effectiveness of PPP Systems of Selected Countries

Having assigned the scores of cost-effectiveness of individual PPP
measures, this section would focus on the comparison of the PPP systems
as a whole for each of the countries. This assessment would be conducted
in the following manner:

Identify the most prevalent form of the PPP measures adopted by each of
the countries to deal with three types of vulnerability in the country
in question.

Then, the weight earlier assigned for each of the individual PPP
measures would be applied to measure the cost-effectiveness of each
country’s PPP system.

The above has been visually illustrated with use of a radar chart.
Figure 3 has clearly indicated that India’s PPP system is the most
cost-effective among three countries. Ideally, this analysis should have
been conducted based on a series of interviews toward PPP experts with
regard to the degree of cost-effectiveness of individual PPP measures,
but these interviews were not carried out due to time/budgetary
constraints. The above is intended to demonstrate a possible method of
comparing the cost-effectiveness of the PPP systems of selected
countries.

Underlying Factors to Enable India to Adopt Cost-Effective Measures

The above analysis indicates that India has been keeping a tight control
on the issuance of contingent liabilities. In usual context, if one
country is stingy in issuing the guarantee for the future possible
losses that country would not able to attract the private sector to
participate in PPP projects, but this did not happen in India. Why it
is? The usual answer to this question is a policy/institutional
framework instituted in India. Although this may be of one of the
factors for the successful implementation of the PPP system in India,
there are other, less noticeable, factors which have enabled India to
succeed with PPP with active participation of the private sector.

Limitation in Choices for Other Contracts Beside the BOT-Based PPP

The GoI’s decision to introduce the PPP system was decisive and sweeping
in scope. Her decision was, for example, that all National Highways
(NHs) have to be developed or upgraded under the BOT-based PPP scheme
from 2005 onward. This means that the traditional public-sector
procurement would no longer be available. In other words, if the
contractors wish to stay in the road construction business, the only
choice available for them is to bid for BOT-based PPP projects or to
become subcontractors to bigger contractors who bid for BOT-based PPP
projects. The effectiveness of this system was proved by the fact that
80% of NH construction has been conducted under BOT-based PPP with use
of the viability gap fund system, 16%, under the annuity-based PPP
system, and only 4%, under traditional public procurement.

Introduction of Measures to Facilitate the Participation of Domestic
Contractors

As seen earlier, a unique element of India’s PPP system is lesser degree
of dependence on foreign investors. This has enabled the GoI to develop
her procurement/contract systems for PPP system solely in consideration
of the needs of domestic contractors. The size of contract packages has
been made very small so that small-scale domestic contractors can bid.
The average size of the contract packages under the National Highway
Development Program (NHDP) III program was $156 million per project,2
which is much smaller than those of Chile ($262 million per project at
1996 price3) and Korea ($450 million per project4).

Another action taken by the GoI is the standardization of BOT/PPP
contracts. This specific action has significantly reduced transaction
costs associated with negotiations of contracts, a major deterrent for
domestic contractors. The GoI developed a MCA which was universally
applied to all PPP contracts. This has enabled both the government and
contractors to go without extensive negotiations. This has resulted not
only in reducing transaction costs, but also facilitated the
participation of domestic contractors in BOT-based PPP projects.

Applicability of the Above Measures to Other Developing Countries

Although the above measures are very unique to India, it is not
impossible for other developing countries to adopt if the sector in
question is those areas in which domestic contractors are available and
also those sectors whose development does not require high level of
technologies or complicated management system. India’s approach may not
be applied to electricity sectors, but it can be applied to road sector
and other similar sectors.

Conclusion

When discussing key success factors for PPP, the importance of
incorporating a proper set of incentives is often emphasized. Although
incentives are important, we should not overlook their cost implication.
Investor-oriented policy measures tend to end up with huge obligation to
pay later by the governments.

The real challenge facing developing countries is how to realize two
contradictory objectives at the same time: (a) securing private sector
participation in PPP projects, but (b) minimizing fiscal obligation to
be shouldered later. India’s PPP system clearly demonstrates that it is
possible to realize these two objectives at the same time. India has
taken a tight control over contingent liabilities, but she has still
manage to secure active participation of the private sector for PPP
projects. Their carefully crafted PPP measures have enable to make this
difficult challenge to be materialized. This would provide useful hints
to those developing countries who are trying to attract the private
sector without overly committing themselves for the coverage of the
future losses to be incurred by the private sector.

Trace the growth from the early times of startups in India when the
Government of India launched the Startup India Mission on January 16,
2016. The number of recognised startups has increased from 452 in 2016
to 84,012 as on November 30, 2022.

rest of the world and there were 84 thousand startups in the country at
the end of November, said Piyush Goyal, Union Minister, according to the
media reports.

The report also states that Goyal mentioned that the startups are prone
to failures is a very high probability. However, the success rate of
startups in India is relatively higher than in the rest of the world.

The Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS), Startup India Seed Fund Scheme
(SISFS) and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS) provide support
to startups at different stages of their business cycle.

The government of India launched the Startup India initiative in 2016 to

What you need to know about becoming an angel investor in India

MINT

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Jan. 28 -- Startup investing has been glamourised in the
media through shows like Shark Tank and headlines about various startups
turning unicorns (a valuation of $1 billion). However, it is
traditionally not featured among the basket of investments available to
individuals. In this piece, we explore the advantages and risks of being
an angel investor.

Individuals can become angel investors in two ways. First, they can
source 'direct deals' or investment opportunities in startups through
their own social network. Second, they can join platforms dedicated to
angel investing such as Angellist, Mumbai Angels and Let's Venture.
These platforms provide avenues for startups to approach individuals for
angel or seed funding. Post-pandemic, most platforms conduct their
operations online. Entrepreneurs pitch ideas to startup investors over
Zoom and other online meeting channels and investors then decide whether
to invest. The angel round is the very first round of funding for a
startup that is typically followed by venture capital rounds such as
Series A, Series B and so on. Venture capital rounds are generally
followed by late stage or pre-IPO funding and ultimately followed by an
initial public offering (IPO).

The big advantage of entering a company at angel or seed round is the
ability to gain from its growth long before it becomes publicly listed.
The big disadvantage is a much higher level of risk. However, going
through an angel platform can reduce the risk. Typically, these
platforms perform an initial round of due diligence before startups are
allowed to pitch and even after investment they perform additional
checks and monitoring of the startups. According to Nakul Saxena, head -
fund strategy & investor relations, LetsVenture, the platform provides a
strong curation process, performs due diligence, manages fund accounting
and portfolio information for the investors and protects investor
rights, "We used to get 50-60 new investors every week till 2021. Last
year that number doubled to 100-120," he added.

Both Let's Venture and Angellist, another startup investment platform,
operate through the 'Angel Fund' structure. Angel funds are Category I
Alternative Investment Funds, regulated by Sebi. These funds require you
to have a minimum net worth of Rs.2 crore (excluding your primary
residence) and you must invest a minimum amount of Rs.25 lakh in the
fund. "Apart from money you should have access-the ability to help
founders with your personal and professional network and the ability to
analyse deals. This is not a passive investment by any means," said
Utsav Somani, partner, Angellist India.

However, some wealth management professionals remain sceptical. "Angel
investing suffers from an adverse selection problem. Startups want a
single large cheque than multiple small cheques (multiple small
investors) and so their first preference is ultra high net worth
individuals (HNIs) or funds. The deals that come to smaller investors
need more diligence and possibly expert help. Angel investments
typically have a longer gestation period and need to be diversified
well," said Sandeep Jethwani, co-founder Dezerv, a wealth tech platform.

Roopali Prabhu who is co-head, products and investments at Sanctum
Wealth, added a few more objections. "Only a small percentage of
startups actually succeed and hence diversification across deals is
important. Second, it is not a one-time investment. Startups keep
needing capital in the initial stages of their existence. Investors with
a net worth less than Rs.100 crore should go through angel funds if they
are really keen. In our case, we suggest pre-Series A investments rather
than angel to reduce the risk. Many startups die before they even get to
pre-Series A," she said.

Taxation: According to Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head, global
mobility services-tax, KPMG India, investments by angel investors in
unlisted shares attract capital gains tax on exit. If the sale
consideration is less than the prescribed Fair Market value (FMV), then
the latter will be considered for tax purposes rather than actual sale
price, subject to other specific conditions. As with other unlisted
shares, gains made within 24 months of purchase are subject to Short
Term Capital Gains (STCG) Tax which is as per the investor's slab rate.
After a 24-month holding period, Long Term Capital Gains Tax (LTCG) at
20% applies and you also get the benefit of indexation.

Mint Take: Startup investing is being democratized and presents an
attractive investment opportunity. However, given the high chances of
startups going bust, you should have a portfolio that is large enough to
accommodate such failures. The allocation to startups also should be a
small part of your portfolio since this is a high risk-high reward
asset.

Meet the VC - Meet Chun Xia, founding partner at TSVC

Jan 25, 2021( Vator News: http://vator.tv/news Delivered by Newstex)
TSVC, formerly TEEC Angel Fund, makes 10 to 20 deals a year from a $25
million fundVenture capital used to be a cottage industry, with very few
investing in tomorrow's products and services. Oh, how times have
changed! While there are more startups than ever, there's also more
money chasing them. In this series, we look at the new (or relatively
new) VCs in the early stages: seed and Series A. But just who are these
funds and venture capitalists that run them?

What kinds of investments do they like making, and how do they see
themselves in the VC landscape? We're highlighting key members of the
community to find out. Chun Xia is a founding partner at TSVC.
Concurrent to his role at TSVC, Chun is the founder and CEO of
Mash5Technologies, a company that focuses on IoT for smart devices.
Mash5 isdedicated to help enterprises improve their user experience,
reduce costs,and transform businesses by consolidating technologies,
products, andoperations. Mash5 is headquartered in Silicon Valley, with
operations in Beijingand Suzhou. From 2000 to 2001, Chun was President
and CTO of Thinkmart, which offersweb marketing solutions for small to
medium intellectual service providers,including legal, accounting,
design, and many other sectors. Prior to that,Xia was the co-founder and
CTO of brightinfo.com, a leading company ine-merchandising management
for B2C online retailers. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a Bachelor of
Engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing. VatorNews: What is your
investment philosophy or methodology? Chun Xia: TSVC is an angel fund.
We invest mostly in the seed stage and we have 10 years of history. Our
philosophy is to constantly look for unicorns. We need to get a unicorn.
We write the very first check, like in Zoom we were the first person to
invest, and then to make returns we need to have a unicorn. We've
already had five, and two more are coming. Also part of a philosophy is
that we believe in big trends. Even when those trends are not so
obvious, if we do believe they have big potential then we want to
invest. Also, if we believe that the team has very strong execution and
ability, and they can be a winner. VN: Talk to me about some of those
trends that you have invested in over the years. CX: One of the old
ones, for example, when we invested in 2011, the trend was mobile
internet for enterprise. Apple announced its iPhone in 2007 and after a
few years we believed it was pretty much ready to get into the
enterprise. So, that was a big trend. The current trend, of course, is
what we see with COVID. COVID is really a huge cultural shift, and will
change our behavior, like how everyone is now working from home. There
is a lot of change, and some changes will stay. That'll create new
opportunities, so we'll see that happen in a lot of ways and new
ecosystems. VN: What are some of the trends that you've seen now because
of COVID that you want to invest in going forward? CX: One good example
is one of our recent portfolio companies, MyYogaTeacher[1]. People
started practicing yoga at home instead of going to a classroom, so this
startup has a yoga teacher on the other end of the globe, in India; you
get a one-to-one Indian teacher and everything happens on Zoom. This is
something new and we believe it will stay after COVID. VN: What are your
categories of interest? CX: In general, we can invest in whatever is IT
related technology, from semiconductors and software and hardware to
artificial intelligence. We don't do things like mature science, we
don't do agriculture technology. VN: What's the big macro trend you're
betting on? CX: As a fund, we just recently discussed a lot internally
that the big trend is big VCs dominating the market. We call them the
'blue chip VCs.' So, then, how does a micro VC survive? This is a big
challenge for us. So, we need to find our survival strategy, find our
angle. VN: What is the size of your current fund and how many
investments do you typically make in a year? CX: We are on Fund IV; we
started at $5 million and now it's a $25 million fund, so it's a small
fund. Every year we invest in 10 to 20 deals, and so far we have 180
portfolio companies. VN: How much is that in dollar amount for you? CX:
The typical check size is $250,000 to $1 million. VN: What kind of
traction does a startup need for you to invest? Do you have any specific
numbers? CX: That's the difficult part because, in our view, we and the
startup, we are in the jungle and there's no clear path, no traction.
It's very different from the people who invest in the A round and can
see numbers; we cannot look at any financial numbers, in that sense. So,
the traction, you can consider it in two parts: one is whatever they're
currently doing, and whatever they've done in the past. The big part is
their history. We can backtrack what they have done as a founder and
that'll give us some kind of a prediction or assessment to see if the
actual traction, in this sense, is proof of execution. Is too early for
numbers so we need to see if the team or the founder is strong enough.
VN: What do you want to see in terms of the team when you invest? CX:
For us it's extremely important. We want to see if there's a DNA fit.
Zoom is a very good example. When Eric talked to us and said, 'I want to
do video conferencing on mobile, so people can use a cell phone, even
when working at an airport,' we said 'Well, this is great, we believe
that will happen.' But Eric said, 'I want to do this for Facebook users,
for consumers,' and I said, 'Yeah, you don't have that DNA, but I do
believe in you. You guys come from WebX and you have enterprise
experience, you can do a terrific job for enterprise.' After one year
they switched from consumer to enterprise and they made it. So, this is
their DNA. The enterprise guy may have a very difficult time doing
consumer and for each startup, they need to consider they have one life,
one shot; don't think you have three lives. This is your life and we
don't want to waste your precious time and resources and talent. Use the
best energy you have. So, DNA matters. It's what we want to look at.
It's why we want to see the last 10 years of your history, it's because
we want to do this kind of DNA test. VN: What about the product or the
market? Do you also look at those? CX: Most startups have a vision they
put on their deck and I always say that most of them will be wrong. Even
then, we are not sure because this is so dynamic. As I said, we're in
the jungle, we can not know the ending clearly. The thing we believe in
is the big potential or the rough direction. Just like in the jungle,
'Yeah, you're heading north but you really don't know what the next step
is.' So, the big potential, like the mobile internet, or AI, how it can
improve and create more automation. That's the big wave. For example,
COVID created a big opportunity because people quickly switched to
digital. In the past, companies spent so much money trying to create
this demand; then, all of the sudden, there's this demand that's just a
given. VN: How have you seen COVID affect valuations? CX: It really
depends on the sector. Like there's one company called Zum[2]. They do a
terrific job. It's kind of an Uber for the kids going to school, but all
the kids are doing homeschool, your classroom is on Zoom, so that's a
big hurt for this type of company. However, anything you can do online,
we see the big potential. Those valuations are high. VN: What sectors
have been well affected positively in terms of valuations, what sectors
have you seen that are affected negatively? CX: It's easy to tell.
Anything where you rely on physical contact, there was a big downturn.
Anything that could be done virtually did well. We evaluate it this way:
if you can really leverage Zoom's ecosystem, that'll be good. We made an
investment earlier in the quarter, it's called, it's for Zoom recording
and you can use AI to create an automatic transcript. This kind of
business really benefited from COVID. VN: Yeah, it's a bad time to be in
the co-working space, for example. Funny enough, I think Airbnb is doing
well because people want to go on like a staycation. So, in some cases,
you actually can benefit even though you're in a physical and not
virtual space. CX: This is something we also talk a lot about. We really
appreciate an Airbnb type of team, which has very strong execution. They
can sense the new opportunity, they can grab the new opportunity. That's
the kind of team we're looking for. VN: There are many venture funds out
there today, how do you differentiate yourself to limited partners? CX:
Everyone has to do this kind of job. 'We're special, we're unique.' For
our uniqueness, we will say we have a lot of unique points. One is our
team; we are all domain experts and all of us were previously engineers.
We have very strong technical backgrounds, and everyone has a particular
field. We have a lot of cumulative knowledge and also have our own
networks. So, this technical expertise helps us a lot in our investments
since we don't have to rely on outsiders and we can judge for ourselves.
For example, when we looked at Zoom, when they talked about AI and
inventing their own codec, we knew what they were talking about. We
could ask, 'how do you make your own codec? That's a data transformation
format.' Actually, we had a huge advantage, because we could see the
quality was much better. The other part is the startup experience. Most
of our team, we had our own startups and some of us are serial
entrepreneurs, like myself. We understand how to grow from zero to one;
we focus on zero to one, not one to 100. So, then using this experience,
we can help us to evaluate the team, whether they are likely to make it.
Also, down the road, when they go from the seed stage to the A round, we
can help the team a lot with our experience. One more thing is the team
size, since we have a very special composition structure. Our team is
not small, even though we're a very small fund: we have 12 partners, so
we can cover a lot of different areas and different experiences. The way
we work is that each deal we have a 10 points credit and then we assign
the credit to the different partners. So, for example, say you feed us a
deal; even if you're not part of our team I can give you one to three
points as a sourcing partner. You could be a one time sourcing partner
for us, since we have a big network, we have a lot of friends,
university and the company alumni. So, that's a big network that helps
give us a lot of deals. VN: I want to actually go back a little bit of
what you said about going from zero to one, instead of zero to 100. Is
zero to one the hardest part? CX: Yeah. If you look at the failure rate,
most startups fail. The hardest part is maybe zero to 0.3, or even
before. That is the really, really tough part. VN: Venture is a two-way
street, where investors also have to pitch themselves. How do you
differentiate your fund to entrepreneurs? CX: Let me share an image with
you. We are trying to rebrand ourselves a little bit and this picture
will be on the homepage. Say you're the founder, and your startup is a
house, then funding is actually just one part, it's kind of a raw
material, building material. Then what we offer is our founders'
experiences, which is just like electricity, and we constantly help you
run this house. Our resources and network are like water, you need that,
and with our technical expertise we can give you a lot of tips on how to
build the house. Our advisory experience can help you with designing the
house. So, this is what we're working on. We're trying to position
ourselves behind the scenes, and a lot of founders, especially deep tech
companies, love talking to us. Quite often they'll say, 'oh, you're the
first VC I can really, really truly talk about our technology. You guys
really understand. You even understand some particulars better than me,
and you can give me advice.' VN: What are some of the investments you've
made that you're super excited about? Why did you want to invest in
those companies? CX: The first thing we really need to see is if the
company has a great vision. The vision can fit into the big potential or
the big emerging market, or even the existing market that will change
and is moving to a different direction, just like Zoom. Video
conferencing was not a new thing, but going after mobile, that was
different. Even today, I think Zoom needs to reinvent themselves after
COVID. So, everyone has a good story but we'll see if this is truly a
good story or if it's just a bluff. The other part is, of course, if we
are we're so excited when we see the great team, a great founder. So, we
have our sense, we have our judgment. We have, for example, Carta[3].
That's a really a true innovator in their space, and also Quanergy[4],
which is probably the first to do LiDAR. For the self driving car, you
need to have a laser radar sensor. Even today that is a no name, but we
do see that they have a big potential. Just like last year, we invested
in MyYogaTeacher, there's one small example on how to leverage the COVID
effect and create this kind of a business. And it has potential to be a
unicorn because why not? We are not 100% sure, it really depends on the
market and also their execution. VN: What are some lessons you learned?
CX: I came from China and got a PhD at the University of Illinois. I
came to Silicon Valley in 1996 and joined Sun Microsystems. That was a
terrific experience because what I quickly realized was that Sun was a
really a huge startup company. Each product is an internal startup, so
my first startup, actually not my own startup, was at Sun. That project
was the earliest cloud project; we did cloud computing, so we learned a
lot. After that, I had my own startup: we were the first to do
e-merchandising because in 1997 and 1998 e-commerce had just gotten
started. Even if you looked at the Kmart website, it was just a catalog,
from A to Z, and there was no merchandising or way to place a product.
There was no personalization. We were the first to do that. That was a
very exciting experience and then the startup quickly got acquired by
somebody else. I feel this kind of innovation, doing new things right
now, is so exciting. For me, VC is a lifetime career direction. Whatever
startup or investment, we need to look at new things and that's my ideal
job. I find it's very, very fascinating to do this. The fund started 10
years ago as a kind of a nonprofit project, because I graduated from
Tsinghua University, which is like the MIT in China, and we have a lot
of alumni, like 15,000 alumni, in Silicon Valley. A lot of people want
to do startups and they seek us as an NGO investor. I talked to Eugene
Zhang and we started this fund because there was a big trend 10 years
ago called a super NGO, like a funder's fund; they paved the path, so we
said why not just do a super NGO? So, that was the starting point. So,
this is a really exciting career for me. I really love to see new
things, I love that. VN: What excites you the most about your position
as VC? CX: I was born in 1962, so, at this age, I think I should heavily
leverage my experience and my accumulated resources. I try to do
whatever I feel I can do best, so it's really like the book the
Outliers, where you spend 10,000 hours working on one particular thing;
I have spent a lot of time and work to create a new thing and innovate
something that never existed. That was in my past career, and that was
my accumulated experience. That actually really helped me to spot new
trends and new potential. Even when it's not so obvious, we can spot
that early and also leverage it to look at the people and whether or not
a team can really execute, can really make it. We made a lot of
mistakes, and we learned a lot of lessons. VN: Is there anything else
that you think I should know about you or the firm or your thoughts
about the venture industry in general? CX: We are trying to raise a Fund
V, and we want to tell people about our strengths. We are extremely
focused on how to identify the next unicorn and leverage our expertise
and our experience and our very uniqueness of operating our fund,
especially with compensation. We can make a fund as a platform. So, even
you could be part of a fund, in that sense. We can contribute and we can
give a piece to you. That's the whole idea. VN: I like that idea, it's
inclusive. I think venture capital can sometimes feel exclusive. 'I
don't have a lot of money, I can't be an investor.' So, I like that idea
that anybody can be part of it. That's like democratizing it. CX: We
want to make it open. The whole technology world and the culture is
going in that direction. Just like in the media, where it used to be
dominated by the big players, and now we have social media making it
more open. VN: Do you see other firms going in that similar direction?
Is that a trend in the industry? CX: It's hard to tell. So far, to the
best of our knowledge, we're the first in Silicon Valley. But we do see
some of that trend and some people have started to accumulate small
money LPs and they claim to be a platform. We need to see what the best
model is to operate and we already have a 10 years of history. I think
we were able to prove that our model really works.Read this article on

From the stacks of books received for review this year, here are some of
the best titles for startup founders, social entrepreneurs, innovators,
and changemakers!

Launched in 2012, YourStory's Book Reviewsection features over 280
titles on innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and digital media.
2020 has been another outstanding year for books on the startup
movement, with more of a focus on co-creation, inner dialogues, and
business model designs - reflecting the growing maturity of the startup
ecosystem around the world.

See our earlier lists of 'Top 10 Books for Entrepreneurs' from the past
eight years as well: 2019,2018,2017,2016,2015,2014,2013,
and2012.YourStory has also published the pocketbook Proverbs and Quotes
for Entrepreneurs: A World of Inspiration for Startupsas a creative and
motivational guide for innovators, accessible as apps (Apple; free
Android version).

Undoubtedly and unfortunately, the biggest development of the year 2020
was the coronavirus pandemic - with triple shock effects in health,
economic, and social spheres. Though a big setback to many firms, a
side-effect was a boost to digital adoption and hybrid business models.
See our reviews of the books Pandemic Inc. and Coming Back from COVID
for insights on business resilience.

business models, leadership, tech trends, design thinking, startup
ecosystems, storytelling, and connecting to a larger purpose.

Click on each title below to see the full book review; also check out
our author interview section for more in-depth insights into
entrepreneurship.

Out-Innovate: How Global Entrepreneurs - from Delhi to Detroit - Are
Rewriting the Rules of Silicon Valley, by Alexandre Lazarow

The global canvas of this book adds to the wealth of analysis on what
makes startups succeed. It goes beyond the usual "Silicon Valley gospel"
to showcase new business models, leadership strategies, team dynamics,
financing models, and ecosystem partnerships. Lessons from the differing
realities of startup environments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America
enrich us all, and will be particularly useful for the emerging
hyper-connected world.

The Unfair Advantage: How You Already Have What it Takes to Succeed, by
Ash Ali and Hasan Kubba

This book shows how it's not just hard work and talent that determine
entrepreneurial success. An unfair advantage is something unique and
internal to each person that gives a competitive upper hard, and exists
even without having worked for it. Even adversity can be converted into
an opportunity, as the frameworks and examples in this book show. The
authors' framework for entrepreneurs goes by the acronym MILES: money,
intelligence/insight, location/luck, education/expertise, and status.

Funding your Startup, by Dhruv Nath and Sushanto Mitra

This book provides aspiring founders with a practical guide on choosing
business ideas, making them viable, and raising funds from investors. In
an engaging, conversational style, the authors document startup
successes and failures in India. The framework is based on the apt
acronym PERSISTENT: Problem, Earnings model, Risks, Size of the market,
Innovation, Scalability, Team, Entry barriers, Niche, and Traction. Each
chapter ends with some discussion on the COVID-19 impact on different
startups and sectors.

The Innovation Ultimatum: How Six Strategic Technologies will Reshape
Every Business in the 2020s, by Steve Brown

Intel's former futurist presents a deep dive into tech trends, business
responses, and emerging startups. Waves of technology are combining and
converging to reshape every industry, and present an ultimatum to
business leaders to innovate or perish. The six key strategic
technologies for business are artificial intelligence, augmented
reality, blockchain, the Internet of Things, 5G networks, and autonomous
machines. "Businesses will experience more technology-driven change in
the next ten years than in the last forty," the author predicts.

Design your Thinking: The Mindsets, Toolsets and Skillsets for Creative
Problem-Solving, by Pavan Soni

This book builds on earlier frameworks of design thinking by IDEO and
Stanford d.School, and provides case studies from over 50 companies in
India. It extends the importance of design thinking not just for product
development but to problem-solving in all walks of life. The book
combines academic rigour with business practicality, and there is also a
handy tear-away poster with a mindmap of the book's topics. There are
recommendations at the individual, organisational and cultural level.

The Invincible Company, by Alex Osterwalder, Yves Pigneur, Fred Etiemble
and Alan Smith

This title is the fourth in the book series by innovation consultancy
Strategyzer. Their earlier bestsellers are Business Model Generation,
Value Proposition Design, and Testing Business Ideas. The book is packed
with descriptions of "the world's best business models" across
categories in stages of 'explore' and 'exploit', as well as patterns and
lessons for cultural transformation in business. The design of the book
is outstanding, and the visually-appealing presentation invites browsing
as well as in-depth analysis.

The Serendipity Mindset: The Art and Science of Creating Good Luck, by
Christian Busch

Individuals and organisations can make luck favour them by taking
conscious steps to cultivate the serendipity mindset and "serendipity
field," according to this book. Luck can be about enabling fortunate
connections to happen, and systematically harnessing them- which is also
good marketing advice for startups. Success comes from an open and
experimental mindset, and not just from a focus on efficiency. From
entrepreneurs to scientists, this book features a range of case studies,
and a 38-question checklist to assess one's serendipity.

Once Upon an Innovation: Business Storytelling Techniques for Creative
Problem Solving, by Jean Storlie and Mimi Sherlock

Business communication and creativity come together in this handy book
for innovators. It shows how story approaches can be embedded throughout
the journey of innovation and change. The book describes activities and
storytelling tools for each of the steps in the innovation journey:
visioning, clarification, ideation, prototyping, stakeholder buy-in, and
pitches. There are also suggestions for group activities revolving
around stories, right from room setup and props to gallery photos and
seating design.

Social Entrepreneurship in India: Quarter Idealism and a Pound of
Pragmatism, by Madhukar Shukla

The rise of the social innovation movement in India, along with profiles
and roadmaps, is well documented in this book. It draws on 120
organisational examples, and provides useful frameworks and tips for
aspiring social entrepreneurs, innovators, academics, policymakers, and
impact investors. The analysis of mindsets, business models,
organisational structure, sustainability, and scale strategies is
particularly useful. The foreword is written by Nobel Laureate Muhammad
Yunus.

Startup Guide Barcelona

The Startup Guide series of books, published by Sissel Hansen in
Copenhagen, covers the startup ecosystem in over 30 cities, such as
London, New York, Berlin, Johannesburg, Cairo, Bangkok, Singapore and
Tokyo. The publisher and editorial team deserve an award for the entire
book series, each of which features interviews with founders, investors,
accelerators and educators. We pick this title on Barcelona because it
is a showcase of the power of co-creation and also one of the most
picturesque startup books around!

We look forward to your comments as well as your suggestions for books
to review in 2021. All of us at YourStory wish our readers and partners
a happy holiday season and a terrific year ahead in 'The Next Normal' -
may a million successful startups bloom!

YourStory has also published the pocketbook 'Proverbs and Quotes for
Entrepreneurs: A World of Inspiration for Startups' as a creative and
motivational guide for innovators (downloadable as apps here: Apple,
Android).

Japan (APEJ) is expected to create an absolute $ opportunity of nearly
US$ 110 Mn between 2017 and 2022.Among types of extremities
reconstruction, elbow reconstruction will remain more lucrative than
hand ...ist reconstruction, but less lucrative than shoulder
reconstruction during 2017 to 2022. Ankle reconstruction will account

Zimmer Biomet's "Comprehensive Segmental Revision System", have been
providing solutions for implant failures. In addition, small startup
organizations are focusing on development of minimally invasive
endoscopic procedures for extremities reconstruction, reducing the pain
and recovery time of patients. For example - "HammerFIT Extremity Reamer
System" has been launched by Instratek for hammertoe surgery. These
advancements and innovations are expected to spur the market growth in
the near future.With advancements and improvements in healthcare
facilities, the life expectancy of people across the globe has gained an
uptick. However, the prevalence of joint disorders, such as the
irreversible condition of osteoarthritis, increases indefinitely with
the rise in aging population. In addition, number of cases related to
sports injuries and trauma are also increasing. These factors will
further drive demand for devices of extremities reconstruction across
the globe. Moreover, advancements in healthcare infrastructure are also
expected to fuel growth of the market. In contrast, unfavorable
reimbursement policies, coupled with complication pertaining to
extremities reconstruction surgeries are expected to hinder growth of
the market.Speak To Research Analyst for Detailed Insights @
