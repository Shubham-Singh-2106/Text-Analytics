The Government with an intent to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing
innovation, startups and encouraging private investments in startup
ecosystem of the country launched Startup India initiative on 16th
January 2016.

As per eligibility conditions prescribed under G.S.R. notification 127
(E) dated 19th February 2019, entities are recognised as startups under
Startup India initiative by the Department for Promotion of Industry and
Internal Trade (DPIIT). Since the launch of Startup India initiative in
2016, DPIIT has recognised 92,683 entities as startups as on 28th
February 2023.

The regular businesses are often measured by success or failure in a
specific number of years of operation, whereas, the startups and
scale-ups (established startups) are more accurately measured by failure
or success in a particular phase making it difficult to put together a
statistic covering all types of new businesses and their failure rate
with any level of accuracy. Therefore, the information with respect to
the success or failure of startups is not centrally maintained by the
Government.

Startup India initiative was launched on 16th January 2016 with an
objective to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and
startups in the country that would drive sustainable economic growth and
generate large scale employment opportunities. The details of various
programs undertaken by the Government to promote startups across the
country under Startup India initiative are given below.

The details of various programs undertaken by the Government to promote
startups

under Startup India initiative across the country are as under:

Startup India Action Plan: An Action Plan for Startup India was unveiled
on 16th January 2016. The Action Plan comprises of 19 action items
spanning across areas such as Simplification and handholding, Funding
support and incentives and Industry-academia partnership and incubation.
The Action Plan laid the foundation of Government support, schemes and
incentives envisaged to create a vibrant startup ecosystem in the
country.

Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) Scheme: The Government has established
FFS with corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore, to meet the funding needs of
startups. DPIIT is the monitoring agency and Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) is the operating agency for FFS. The
total corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore is envisaged to be provided over the
14th and 15th Finance Commission cycles based on progress of the scheme
and availability of funds. It has not only made capital available for
startups at early stage, seed stage and growth stage but also played a
catalytic role in terms of facilitating raising of domestic capital,
reducing dependence on foreign capital and encouraging home grown and
new venture capital funds.

Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS): The Government has
established the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups for providing
credit guarantees to loans extended to DPIIT recognized startups by
Scheduled Commercial Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and
Venture Debt Funds (VDFs) under SEBI registered Alternative Investment
Funds. CGSS is aimed at providing credit guarantee up to a specified
limit against loans extended by Member Institutions (MIs) to finance
eligible borrowers viz. DPIIT recognised startups.

Regulatory Reforms: Over 50 regulatory reforms have been undertaken by
the Government since 2016 to enhance ease of doing business, ease of
raising capital and reduce compliance burden for the startup ecosystem.

Ease of Procurement: To enable ease of procurement, Central Ministries/
Departments are directed to relax conditions of prior turnover and prior
experience in public procurement for all DPIIT recognised startups
subject to meeting quality and technical specifications. Further,
Government e-Marketplace (GeM) Startup Runway has been developed which
is a dedicated corner for startups to sell products and services
directly to the Government.

Support for Intellectual Property Protection: Startups are eligible for
fast-tracked patent application examination and disposal. The Government
launched Start-ups Intellectual Property Protection (SIPP) which
facilitates the startups to file applications for patents, designs and
trademarks through registered facilitators in appropriate IP offices by
paying only the statutory fees. Facilitators under this Scheme are
responsible for providing general advisory on different IPRs, and
information on protecting and promoting IPRs in other countries. The
Government bears the entire fees of the facilitators for any number of
patents, trademark or designs, and startups only bear the cost of the
statutory fees payable. Startups are provided with an 80% rebate in
filing of patents and 50% rebate in filling of trademark vis-a-vis other
companies.

Self-Certification under Labour and Environmental laws: Startups are
allowed to self-certify their compliance under 9 Labour and 3
Environment laws for a period of 3 to 5 years from the date of
incorporation.

Income Tax Exemption for 3 years: Startups incorporated on or after 1st
April 2016 can apply for income tax exemption. The recognized startups
that are granted an Inter-Ministerial Board Certificate are exempted
from income-tax for a period of 3 consecutive years out of 10 years
since incorporation.

International Market Access to Indian Startups: One of the key
objectives under the Startup India initiative is to help connect Indian
startup ecosystem to global startup ecosystems through various
engagement models. This has been done though international Government to
Government partnerships, participation in international forums and
hosting of global events. Startup India has launched bridges with over
15 countries that provides a soft-landing platform for startups from the
partner nations and aid in promoting cross collaboration.

4 Common Mistakes Done by Startups

Retailer

Length: 543 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Feb. 01 -- India has emerged as the third largest start-up
base and such ventures are poised to grow 2.2 times to reach 10,500 by
2020 despite a perception that the ecosystem in the country has slowed
down in the last year, says a report.

India is in the third position just behind US and UK, and nearly 1,400
new startups are expected by end of 2016, up by 8-10% from last year,
revealed the "Indian Startup Ecosystem Maturing - 2016" report by
Nasscom-ZINNOV.

Starting a startup business demands hard work, energy, time, money and
constant motivation from customer side as well as from within to keep
the business running and overcoming all sorts of barriers.

Here is the list of common mistakes repeated by brand new start-ups, one
can take notes what to do and what not to:

1. Thrifty or Extravagant:

Often in startups, the owners are found to have either of the two common
mindsets-

(a) You have to spend money to make more money.

(b) I'll spend the bare minimum until I have some decent cash flow.

This mentality often leads to the failure of the startup. One needs to
be very wise when it comes to spending money. One should not hesitate to
invest in good people, quality products.

Every minute detailing of expenses and profits / loses should be
documented, to identify if the flow of money is greater than or lesser
than the inflow of money.

2. Over Confidence:

Before initiating any business, the owner should be well aware of the
movements of the market. One should know the rules, regulations as well
as loopholes in the game before entering the marked area. Likewise, the
startup owner should know the existing companies, sprouting companies as
well as their position, capabilities, and weaknesses.

Some startup owners live in a superficially thought bubble that their
idea is unique and no one can come up with anything better than that,
which is why they think they cannot possibly have a competition. Their
overconfidence keeps them blindfolded and ignorant till the thought
bubble bursts.

3. Lack of Decision Making:

When one starts a startup firm, coming up with the idea is not enough,
there is long way full of ups and downs to cover, which is why he/she
should learn to take decisions not on a personal level but as a team.

Some startups lack the quality of decision making. Hiring low-cost
employee, spending too much on decorating the office or taking too much
time in unnecessary things rather than starting the work required to do.

Their unplanned journey leads them to nowhere. It is business, not a
soul-searching spiritual journey to find self-goals in life.

4. Fear of Failure:

SomeSometimesr thinking, over consciousness, can spoil the game; some
startups are too scared to take risk or a new experiment, which cost
them in later stage.

As per Robert F. Kennedy, 'Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever
achieve greatly.'

There is no guide book to success; one might help you in not committing
the repeated common mistakes but there is no step-by-step guide to
success.

If you are too afraid to take risk, fight with the fear first, only them
one can uncover the true potential of the startup. Moreover, the
fighting spirit will provide the required push and will keep the
momentum and energy up of the entire team.

How to build a successful team as an entrepreneur?

The secret that every entrepreneur should know to build a successful
team in their organization.

Secret Every Entrepreneur To Build A Successful Team

Start-ups and entrepreneurial ventures cannot sustain for long, in the
absence of the right team. This basically means that an entrepreneur not
only needs to invest his time and money into getting employees to work
in the start-up phase and later, but he also needs to get the right
people on board.

One of the top reasons behind start-up failures is the absence of the
right team.

About 23% of entrepreneurial ventures fade away because the entrepreneur
could not find the right team to work with him.

Entrepreneurs are futuristic people who have innovative and
forward-thinking ideas and concepts that they translate into operational
business ventures. But their job does not end here. It is just the
beginning. Having a great idea is not going to suffice. The entrepreneur
needs to invest in team building to reap the fruits of his labor.
Remember that start-ups are challenging and working for one can be
grueling. It requires great deal of perseverance and hard toil to start
seeing sales and revenues coming in. The journey from the start till
this point is no way easy and as an entrepreneur you need to ensure that
you have the right people with the right competencies to work in your
team.

Here are few strategic and practical ways to get the right team inboard:

Map your organizational requirement and architecture with job roles

This simply means that you need to divide the entire recruitment
activity into smart phases. First dissect your organizational setup to
understand what job roles need to be filled up in the first phase. These
are the functionalities that are crucial and critical and must be filled
up for survival sake- for infusing your business with life. Sustenance
is in the second phase where you go further and expand the team.
Typically, there could be multiple departments in an organization. What
you need to see is if your business needs to have all departments in one
go or can you start slowing with first focusing on the basic ones to be
filled up.

Invest your time in team building

Team building is not only about getting salaried and contractual people
to work for you; it embodies a lot more in terms of the kind of respect
and regard you give to each person as individuals, the kind of job
responsibilities they have been entrusted with, ensuring that their core
competencies have been rightly matched with their key responsibilities,
that these employees are motivated to come to work each day and that
they are enthusiastic to contribute to their work in the most effective
manner. One very important aspect of team building is to focus on
communication. When communication channels are open, honest and
transparent, it can instill and enhance the confidence levels in
individual employees. Working for start-ups can be mentally and
physically taxing. Keeping communication balanced and open can help your
team work with greater productivity and focus.

Ensure that you pick the people with the right approach and attitude

Most entrepreneurs would want to do this but often fail to understand
how to go about. You have two ways to do this - either recruit a
performance-savvy HR manager or outsource the work to a reputed HR
agency. With modern technology, there are ways and methods to check for
compatibility along with competency and skills of candidates during the
interview process. There are numerous psychometric and personality tests
that can be employed to understand if a recruit is the right fit to your
team. The point is that by recruiting the wrong person you are going to
waste more time and money than by waiting for the right fit to come by.

Team engagement is equally important

Go beyond the demands of the daily grind to know more about your team
and individual members. It helps in creating a compassionate image of
you in front of your people. Indulge your team from time to time -
organize casual Friday lunches or weekend get-together helping team
members to bond among themselves as well as with you. Team engagement
also means that you help your team understand that you want them to
progress and grow in their career and life. Through training and
workshops, you provide them with the opportunity to learn new skills and
upgrade their existing know-how. Organizing offsite, corporate family
day out and other such activities help strengthen the collaborative
bonding of your team, also instilling a positive and lively work
culture.

Learn from failures and celebrate the successes together

You fail as a team and you win as a team. This is ideally how the work
culture should be. Yes, individual responsibilities and productivity are
important because they finally affect the overall business performance.
But, the best way to keep everyone together and committed to a greater
cause is to deliberate the failures together and take the learning from
it as a team, instead of pinpointing and blaming a X or a Y. Similarly,
when it is time to celebrate, let it be out in the open, together so
that each team member can feel the joy of good performance. Yes, you can
publicly appreciate and accolade the people who have done the best or
have performed extraordinarily but give everybody the chance to feel
that they have had a role to play in the success.

Be the ideal leader

Leadership can play a major role in team building. It's okay if you are
not the ideal leader but you can try to be one for sure. The better
leader you are, the better will be the motivation levels of your team.
The higher the motivation levels, the more charged-up they would be to
give their best. If you are ready to give your entrepreneurship a fair
chance to grow and sustain, your people will be equally inspired and
enthusiastic. The moment you despair, indulge in preferential treatment
and get into negativeness, the team that you built with so much care and
detailing will shred away into tatters in no time.

How R&D creates value for the firm and, ultimately, the investor

The Financial Express

November 14, 2018 Wednesday

Body

Companies invest every year significant amount on research and
development (R&D) activities because they want to grow by developing new
products and services. It is difficult for companies to remain
competitive if they do not stay ahead of the technology curve. While
investing in a company's stocks, we should focus on the R&D spending of
that company. In sectors such as pharmaceutical, telecom, electrical,
engineering, bio-technology, information technology, automobile, etc.
R&D is a crucial component of innovation and a key factor in developing
new competitive advantages.

Encouragement by government

The government encourages research in business. Under the Income Tax Act
additional deductions for R&D expenses are provided. Scientific research
and R&D expenses are covered. One hundred percentage deduction is
available on expenses incurred on specified scientific research as per
I-T Act. This 100% deduction is available in the year in which capital
expenditure is incurred. But depreciation is not allowed on this capital
expenditure. Further, expenses incurred in earlier three years before
the commencement of the business is also allowed for deduction.

R&D creates value for the firm

In fact, R&D projects evolve over stages and generally the stages in an
R&D projects such as start-up, failure, breakthrough, and new product
introduction are often linked to each other in sequences, rather than
standing alone as isolated events. Even failures and dead ends often
provide valuable scientific and future product information.

The most important question is whether R&D investments create value for
the firm. Investment science literature concludes that stock markets
across the globe value firms' R&D investments positively. The market
value of traded firms is positively affected by R&D investments and
stock prices react positively to announcements of new R&D investments.

At the same time, the outcome of R&D investments are subject to a very
high degree of uncertainty. Short-term investors often view R&D expenses
as a drag on profits because it is hard to measure the

long-term impact of individual R&D

investments.

Measuring outcome of R&D

Firms may be continuously spending R&D but there is no guarantee that
the company will come out with innovative products / services. This is
especially true for companies in the pharmaceutical, telecom, and
technology sectors. One globally agreed way through which we can measure
the outcome of R&D is patent volume. Under this method, investors can
identify the overall patent volume and patent grant success rates. It
measures the global reach of a company's portfolio of intellectual
property entries and gauges the impact of a patent on the basis of
citations linked to it.

Companies across the globe spend money on R&D to ensure that their
products and services sport the latest innovations and avoid being
technologically

obsolete or suffer from market displacement effects and the like.
Investors should check out the R&D spending before investing in a
company.

Coaches Lead Entrepreneurs Into A Sustainable Business Environment

Business World

September 15, 2021

Length: 710 words

Byline: Deepshikha Kumar

Body

Sustainability is not just a buzzword but the foundation of several
businesses that aim to board onto a highly competitive future. It should
be the central objective of a company's vision, and every entrepreneur
must realise the significance of this powerful concept. Though the idea
might seem easy to grasp, it requires a complicated and coordinated
strategy. All this will be easier with the assistance of an experienced
business strategist, advisor or coach.

Why do many fail?

Sustainable goals cannot be achieved when a company is in a state of
quandary. According to a recently published research of CB Insights, the
main reasons for start-up failures are a flawed business model, lack of
working capital, wrong launch timing, unhealthy competition, and legal
complexities. And, it is an undeniable factor that lack of experience is
the common factor among all shortcomings. Entrepreneurs, especially
those in charge of start-ups, often negotiate these whilst being
pressured by stakeholders, with banks and investors being two prominent
examples. Unfortunately, because of the impulse to seek short-term
profits, they fail to realise that this may lead to long-term
liabilities for the company. It can also be seen as an unintentional
deviation from the sustainable growth trajectory. The role of a coach is
hence extremely important. The responsibility of a coach is to help
entrepreneurs maintain a balance between their social and commercial
goals.

What do experts say?

In the words of Jose Audet and Paul Couteret, "Coaching provides
entrepreneurs with the opportunity to think differently about the
challenges experienced, rather than simply absorbing advice." A coach
stimulates the creativity and curiosity of an entrepreneur; banishing
the common refrain "this is how things are done around here," while
encouraging him to actively look for solutions. In the present scenario,
when pandemic has disturbed the demand and supply side and businesses
are grappling with unprecedented challenges, coaches can be the saviours
to entrepreneurs.

How can a coach help?

To avoid being left behind and exploited, a business should be both
innovative and scalable. Through non-directive, collaborative and
engaging conversations, a coach helps the entrepreneur to utilise his
maximum potential in building inspirational teams and organisations.

A coach always looks at the disciple as an extension of himself and
never sees them as a client. He wishes to see his mentee as a leader in
his respective field and feels proud of making others successful.

Making a business ready for a sustainable business environment demands
unconventional ideas because traditional siloed thinking doesn't look
relevant in the present context. Coaches help entrepreneurs with their
business needs. They also assist entrepreneurs with building the right
commitment level and focusing on the right tasks at the right time. To
grow sustainably, a business needs to spend its limited resources
rationally and wisely. A qualified coach, who helps understand how to
delegate tasks and manage people as effectively as possible, could
achieve the transformation.

As a person who runs a business, it is fundamental to have a broad
vision that encompasses the growth and development of different parts of
the organisation at once. Leaders with this outlook will succeed more
often than those without because they can look at the big picture.

From adapting to market trends to innovative technologies and improving
customer service to competing with disruptors, entrepreneurs need to
have great anticipation and decision-making skills to lead the business
towards sustainability. A coach supports the entrepreneur in aligning
organisational resources with the organisation's goals, facilitating
change, and creating an actionable blueprint for the entrepreneur.

Entrepreneurial coaching enables founders to become aware of their
hidden strengths and qualities, and promote a knowledge-driven culture
in the organisation. The coach hones entrepreneurs' managerial and
leadership skills, which are indispensable to achieve sustainability
goals. Hence, coaches are as essential in the business ecosystem as
professors in a university. Their absence is an easy entry to untoward
threats and challenges.

What's the emotional cost a founder pays when the startup shuts down?

Failures in startups are a given. But what of the founder? How do they
deal with the pressure and emotional cost of the shutdown of their
venture?

Social messaging groups were recently abuzz that social ecommerce
startup Wooplr had shut shop. Then came confirmation of the same - the
screenshot of a mail sent by the startup's finance team to customers.
The mail read: "Due to unforeseen circumstances, we have had to
temporarily shut down our operations. Hence, request you to support us
in this difficult time. We are trying our best to resolve any pending
payments over the course of the next few months. We will send you an
update over the course of time."

Backed by Sistema Asia Fund, Astarc Ventures, and Helion Venture
Partners, Wooplr became the latest casualty in the Indian startup space.
No wonder, it again brought up conversations around startups and
failure. What went wrong and why?

Like one startup founder said on condition of anonymity,

"When we shut shop, it was the talk of the town. Everyone had an opinion
of what we had done wrong and where all we had messed up. Everyone
seemed to know better than us on what was going wrong - how badly we had
managed funds, how our business model was doomed from day one. It was my
personal hell, where I was burning every single day."

Failure is part of the drill

Successful startup founders achieve hero status. They are quoted and
awarded, and become inspirations for aspiring entrepreneurs. But for
every one such founder, there are many others who have failed - some in
the initial stages of operations, others after seeing some measure of
success.

According to a report by the IBM Institute for Business Value and Oxford
Economics, close to 90 percent of startups fail within the first five
years. Despite the high chance of failure, there is woefully little
spoken about failures in the startup ecosystem.

"There is this sense of deep loss, like something has died. It possibly
is like bereavement, where the helplessness, anger and every step are
counted and recounted multiple times. You keep going back and thinking
of everything that could've been, or maybe what you should've done
better. The pain is inexplicable," says a founder on his startup
failing.

Have more conversations

"You are expected to win. Everyone bets on you, believing that you are
going to win and win against all odds. And failing just isn't an option.
And the times you do falter, the scrutiny seems unbearable," says a
startup mentor and investor on the condition of anonymity.

The solution here, say many, is to seek close people who one can talk
to. In India, talking about failures is almost taboo, but now, that
narrative is changing, and more and more people are open to actually
talk about failure in constructive ways. "There is a strong stigma
associated with it (failure), which in turn puts immense mental strain
on the founder," says the mentor.

Anna Chandy, psychologist and Chairperson of The Live Love Laugh
Foundation, says, "Nobody talks about the journey of failures and how it
is normal. We need to start accounting for those as well in all the
stories we write and talk about."

Facing the storm

Anna explains failure often impacts one's self worth, and failed
entrepreneurs soon start experiencing a heightened sense of inadequacy.
"A founder often ends up putting most of their time into building the
venture. Most times, their relationships with spouses, partners or even
close-friends end up on the back burner. It, therefore, is important
that founders find a balance and even have a support system. And not
just to deal with failures, but even to deal with everyday stress that
ends up being a part of the job," she adds.

There are also plenty of founders ready to talk about their failures,
and have others learn from their experiences. K Vaitheeswaran is one of
them. The founder of India's first ecommerce startup, Indiaplaza,
documented his journey in the book Failing to Succeed: the story of
India's first ecommerce company.

After the initial success with Indiaplaza, Vaitheeswaran says shutting
down was painful. He says,

"For the investors, I was just another item in their portfolio they had
already moved on from. All my so-called 'friends' - investors,
relatives, well-wishers, and anyone I knew - were all suddenly
unreachable, travelling or busy."

"The creditors were relentless and restless, calling me for dues the
company owed them," he recalls. "Everything is hunky dory till things go
wrong, and then a mess created by several people becomes the
entrepreneur's sole responsibility. People I knew well and trusted,
distanced themselves. It was like I had contracted a communicable
disease. And these were people who could have helped if they had chosen
to," he adds.

Everyone has their crosses to bear

Another founder says life at a startup was about being high strung all
the time. "It's about going from extreme highs of funding, the euphoria,
talk of higher valuations and deals, to suddenly becoming a blip that
everyone wants to remove. It is a crashing feeling that just cannot be
explained. The people who once loved and praised you are nowhere near
you and you are suddenly all alone taking the burden of that failure."

And this burden, many psychologists say, can lead to anxiety,
alienation, and even depression.

A support system, in such cases helps. Be it at home, or a group of
close friends. Anna says a founder should seek support from people they
know who will be supportive and non-judgmental. "You need someone with
you, who has been there and done that. A sort of go-to person who can be
objective and give you right direction," says Anna.

It is also important to take a pause, take some time off to process what
happened, and understand what went wrong. And maybe that might just give
one the courage to brush off the dust, and stand up to start up again.

And to Wooplr's Praveen Rajaretnam, Ankit Sabharwal, Soumen Sarkar, and
Arjun Zacharia, there is always life beyond the shutdown of a startup.

Time ripe for govt to push growth: Kotak MF chief

The Hindu Business Line

Jul 21, 2019( The Hindu Business Line:
http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Must not
worry too much about fiscal deficit or inflation, says Nilesh Shah The
Government should marshal all its resources to boost growth rather than
worry too much about the fiscal deficit and containing inflation,
according to Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Asset
Management Company.In an exclusive interaction with journalists at
BusinessLine 's Mumbai office, Shah said everything can be sacrificed to
achieve growth, because once it is achieved, everything will fall into
place. By improving growth, the government could improve supplies and
that will ensure lower inflation.Funds at reasonable costThe government
should provide ample money to the industry at a reasonable cost for
restarting growth.

It has to facilitate corporates to tap both debt and equity. Shah, who
heads the fund house that manages about Rs. 1.70-lakh crore in assets,
also pointed to China, whose debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 300 per
cent.'While punishing misbehaviour, we have to create a risk-taking
culture and should not punish every failure. The Indian start-up culture
does not encourage failure like it is done globally. Only entrepreneurs
who borrow money and take risk will create growth; the government won't
be able to do it,' he added. Had the government privatised BSNL and MTNL
when the telecom sector was booming, it would have made Rs. 1-lakh
crore. Now, it is talking of providing them Rs. 1 -lakh crore to
survive.The time is ripe for the government to focus on growth as all
other components that threaten economic growth such as fiscal deficit,
inflation and banks NPA are under control. Shah said whenever there is a
Pay Commission recommendation, the fiscal deficit would go up by 1.5-2
per cent. This time around, it fell by 0.6 per cent because the
government has decelerated economic growth by curbing the credit growth
to 12-14 per cent from 22-24 per cent. Now, inflation is at 4 per cent
because interest rates have been hiked significantly. Credit growth,
which was at 24 per cent, is limping at 12-14 per cent today.In 2014,
for every Rs. 100 of GDP growth, banks were providing credit of Rs. 144.
In 2018, for every Rs. 100 of GDP growth, banks were giving only Rs. 88,
Shah said.All these measures impacting liquidity were taken to lower

Why is Franchising Business Booming in Indian Market?

Franchising World

Body

February 22 -- The simple business model that franchising offers is a
significant motivation behind why the industry is growing by a wide
margin all over. Nonetheless, there are a few reasons for it turning out
to be a particularly immense success and among the fastest-growing
sectors in India: 

1. Lower Rate of Failure: 

Compared with other start-up ventures, franchises have a diminished
possibility of failure since the business idea has already been worked
out. Existing loopholes are dealt with, and there is a proven model of
what works and what doesn't so franchisees are more eager and confident
about investing in such businesses. 

 

2. Demand for Franchised Business:

The increasing buying force of the Indian middle class combined with an
expansion in brand awareness has encouraged a significant market
interest for global brands that retail primarily through the franchise
system. Furthermore, being a nation of over a billion people, the Indian
market gives colossal numbers in sales simply because the number of
consumers is so high.

3. India as a Big Market:

Because of the demand in India, mostly American investors and brands,
see the country as a major, advantageous destination to set up
franchised outlets. The franchise model likewise works across diverse
fields like food and beverage, beauty, medical care, and a lot more in
this manner allowing a greater number of companies with differed
products and services to set up effective franchise businesses across
the nation. India, being one of the quickest developing economies on the
planet, offers great opportunities in this arising business model. 

4. Privatization in Different Sectors:

Gone are the times of customers relying upon a solitary service. With
the privatization of everything in India from schooling and medical care
to telecommunication, there has been a consistent rise both in the
arrival of international brands in the nation as well as national retail
chains. With this, the scope for franchising has gone up, as well.   

5. Indianisation of Products and Services: 

Understanding the customer section and taking into account their
particular necessities is a critical piece of any successful business,
and this is a significant motivation behind why franchised outlets in
India have built a massive consumer base. Most big brands in the nation
have customized their offerings to suit the Indian palate and
hospitality services. With the demographic makeover that India is
encountering with a middle class that has increased disposable income,
there is a consistent development in the number of consumers for branded
products and franchised names. 

6. First-time Entrepreneurs:

Reports demonstrate that the Indian franchise industry is being driven
by youngsters who are opting on franchising as their first
entrepreneurship venture. These new entrants decide to be franchisees
because of the limited risks and already-established model, which give
almost-instant benefits and freedom in business. Truth be told, as of
now, about 35% of Indian franchisees are first-time businessmen,
contributing substantially to the development of the sector in India.

Failure is a choose-your-own adventure for startups

April 12 -- Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the
business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the
headlines.

This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic, think
about a question and unpack the rest. This week, given a parade of
headlines and news that Fast shut down, Natasha and Alex asked: What are
we missing when we talk about startup failure?

The question comes after one of Natasha's recent Startups Weekly
columns, where she looked into the complexity of startup failure, the
fallacy of takedown stories and the importance of diversity in
newsrooms. Here's an excerpt:

 

There's the argument that startup tensions are inevitable and common, so
should we spotlight every time something bubbles to the surface,
especially at the cost of an underrepresented founder who may just be
doing their best? There's also an argument that the business is messy,
so we should report on the issues as we hear about them; and there's the
narrative of the female takedown story, in which people believe that
women are targeted by the press more than men due to unreasonably high
standards.

In today's episode we discussed our own definitions of failure in the
past (Theranos and WeWork), current examples of rising tensions and what
this means for early-stage startups and historically overlooked
founders. There have been more layoffs recently, some notable valuation
cuts and the implosion of Fast to weigh against 2021's strident startup
optimism. That makes this the perfect time to dig into the topic of
failure, and how to cover it from a startup perspective.

Finally, as promised, here's a look at our artsy depictions of the
startup failure cycle:

 

 

Don't forget that Equity is live this Thursday, and you can you come
hang out with us on Hopin (free, and you can ask questions) or Twitter
Spaces (free, but you cannot ask questions) if you'd like! See you then!

Pradeep Reddy Kamasani Introduces a Startup Advisor Program to Help
Small Businesses to Scale Up

Web newswire

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Feb. 9 -- Pradeep Reddy Kamasani, Founder & CEO of HunterTech
and Angel Investor in startups,early stage companies, understands the
business startups ecosystem well, so he wants to help startups to scale
up.

Business startups in India improve significantly. Based on the data,
there are over 1.300 startups in 2019 in India. This positive trend
leads India to the third-largest startup in the world. The startups help
over 60.000 Indians to get a job. Those startups need a variety of
support, such as market access, funding, and guidance to scale up. The
same case happens in the U.S. where there was also a significant
improvement in business startups in 2019. There were 30.7 million new
small businesses in the U.S. in 2019. The condition opens more jobs for
around 59.9 million people in 2019. Most of those new businesses need to
be scaled up along with sufficient and entrepreneurship knowledge.

Just like the classic issues, startups need more access to the right
market, funding, and guidance from the experienced to fight against the
tight competition. Unfortunately, some of those startups were
surrendered and couldn't continue the business. Commonly, a new business
fails to scale up and even faces a serious problem such as bankruptcy
after 2 or 3 years. The issue behind the failure is because those
startups were difficult to find the right target market. They also don't
understand business management and model, along with poor team
management. A startup advisor program is considered a good solution for
those who start a new business and want to scale up. The advisor is an
expert and experienced enough on the business, including business
models, strategies, marketing, and many more. The certified advisors
will also explain the ideas of the angel investor in startups.

Pradeep Reddy Kamasani, Founder & CEO of HunterTech and Angel Investor
in startups,early stage companies, explains that the world needs more
entrepreneurs and innovations to open more jobs to others. Moreover,
they also have to be brave enough to take risks and courage to create
something revolutionary. The main goal is not only to create a small
business but also to scale it up to become a giant business. As a
Startup Advisor Board, Pradeep Reddy has experienced I.T., business,
sales, and marketing, especially in North America, Europe, and Asia. He
understands the startup ecosystem well and what makes most startups fail
to scale up their business. Mr. Reddy wants to motivate those who have
startups to improve their skills and knowledge to face the future and
tight business competition. As a result, startups can't only develop
their business but also compete fairly to be a unicorn business in the
future.

Bristol entrepreneur who exited for up to $800M doubles-down on the city
with deep-tech incubator and VC fund

December 22 -- Harry Destecroix co-founded Ziylo while studying for his
PhD at the University of Bristol. Ziylo, a university spin-out company,
developed a synthetic molecule that binds to glucose in blood. Four
years later, and by then a Phd, Destecroix sold the company to Danish
firm Novo Nordisk, one of the biggest manufacturers of diabetes
medicines, which had realized it could use Ziylo's molecule to unlock a
'smart' insulin. The deal has been estimated to be be worth over $800m..

Destecroix is now embarking on a project, "Science Creates", to repeat
the exercise of creating deep-tech, science-based startups, and it will
once more be based out of Bristol.

To foster this deep tech ecosystem it will offer a specialized incubator
space able to house Wet Labs, a £15 million investment fund and a
network of strategic partners to nurture science and engineering
start-ups and spin-outs.

The Science Creates hub, in partnership with the University of Bristol
and located in the heart of the city, is aspiring to become a sort of
'West Coast' for England, and the similarities, at least with an earlier
version of Silicon Valley, are striking.

The Bay Area of old was cheaper than the East Coast of the US, had a
cornerstone university, access to capital, and plenty of talent. Bristol
has all that and for capital, it can access London, less than 90 minutes
by train. But what it's lacked until now is a greater level of
"clustering" and startup-focused organization, which is clearly what
Destecroix is planning to fix.

In a statement for the launch, he explained: "Where a discovery is made
has a huge bearing on whether it's successfully commercialized. While
founding my own start-up, Ziylo, I became aware of just how many
discoveries failed to emerge from the lab in Bristol alone. No matter
the quality of the research and discovery, the right ecosystem is
fundamental if we are going to challenge the global 90% failure rate of
science start-ups, and create many more successful ventures."

Science Creates is be grown out of the original incubator, Unit DX, that
Destecroix set up in collaboration with the University of Bristol in
2017 to commercialize companies like his own.

 

The 'Science Creates ecosystem' will comprise of:

Science Creates Incubators: Unit DX houses 37 scientific and engineering
companies working on healthtech, the environment and quality of life.
The opening of a second incubator, Unit DY, close to Bristol Temple
Meads train station, will mean it can support 100 companies and an
estimated 450 jobs. The Science Creates' physical footprint across the
two units will reach 45,000 sq ft.

Science Creates Ventures: This £15 million EIS venture capital fund is
backed by the Bristol-based entrepreneurs behind some of the
South-West's biggest deep tech exits.

Science Creates Network: This will be a portfolio of strategic partners,
mentors and advisors tailored to the needs of science and engineering
start-ups.

Destecroix is keen that the startups nurtured there will have more than
"Wi-Fi and strong coffee" but also well-equipped lab space as well as
sector-specific business support.

He's betting that Bristol, with its long history of academic and
industrial research, world-class research base around the University of
Bristol, will be able to overcome the traditional challenges towards the
commercialization of deep tech and science-based startups.

Professor Hugh Brady, Vice-Chancellor and President at the University of
Bristol, commented: "We are delighted to support the vision and help
Science Creates to build a thriving deep tech ecosystem in our home
city. Great scientists don't always know how to be great entrepreneurs,
but we've seen the impact specialist support can have in helping them
access the finance, networks, skills, and investment opportunities they
need. Working with Science Creates, we aim to support even more
ground-breaking discoveries to progress outside the university walls,
and thrive as successful commercial ventures that change our world for
the better."

Ventures in Unit DX so far include:- Imophoron (a vaccine tech start-up
that is reinventing how vaccines are made and work - currently working
on a COVID vaccine)- Cytoseek (a discovery-stage biotech working on cell
therapy cancer treatment)- Anaphite (graphine-based science for next gen
battery technology).

In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Destecroix went on to say:
"After my startup exited I just got really interested in this idea that,
where discovery is actually founded has a huge bearing on whether
something is actually commercialized or not. The pandemic has really
taught us there is a hell of a lot more - especially in the life
sciences, and environmental sciences - that has still yet to be
discovered. Vaccines are based on very old technology and take a while
to develop."

"Through this whole journey, I started trying to understand it from an
economic perspective. How do we get more startups to emerge? To lower
those barriers? I think first of all there's a cultural problem,
especially with academically-focused universities whereby
entrepreneurship a dirty word. I had to go against many of my colleagues
in the early days to spin out, then obviously universities own all the
IP. And so you've got to go through the tech transfer office etc and
depending on what university you are at, whether it's Imperial,
Cambridge or Oxford, they're all different. So, and I put the reason why
there were no deep terch startups in Bristol down to the fact that there
was no incubator space, and not enough investment."

"I've now made about 14 angel investments. Bristol has now catapulted
from 20th in the league tables for life sciences to six in the country
in the last three years and this is largely due to the activities that
we've been helping to encourage. So we've helped streamline licensing
processes for the university, and I've helped cornerstone a lot of these
deals which has resulted in a wave of these technology startups coming
in."

"I thought, now's the time to professionalize this and launch a
respectable Bristol-based venture capital firm that specializes in deep
technologies."

Space: the new frontier for investment trusts; INVESTING Experts warn
sector should be ranked with other alternatives

The first UK-listed investment trust dedicated to space ventures hopes
support from retail investors will help fuel a smooth lift-off for the
company's initial public offering next week.

Seraphim Space Investment Trust aims to raise £180m to invest in
early-stage companies working to profit from the rush into space. Its
London listing offers retail investors access to companies that have
been difficult for them to invest in.

"We wanted to make access to space affordable to the man on the street.
You don't need to be a billionaire to invest," said Mark Boggett,
Seraphim's chief executive.

The launch comes amid growing interest in space companies from
investors, as enterprises such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's
Blue Origin push forward the commercialisation of space.

However, investment experts caution that retail investors should not
overload on spacerelated vehicles.

Boggett said the decline in the cost of satellites will bring a surge in
the number of orbiters collecting data about the Earth. That can be used
in businesses from predicting the weather to facilitating insurance
claims.

"Space is not about rockets and satellites. It's about a digital play,"
said Boggett. "The companies that we are investing in don't see
themselves as space infrastructure companies. They see themselves as
data companies."

Space is among the latest thematic investment opportunities to court
retail investors. Funds focused on niches such as renewable energy or
healthcare have drawn record inflows.

Worldwide, venture capital investment in space companies jumped 95 per
cent to $8.7bn in the year to March, according to Seraphim, including
the combined $4.2bn raised by SpaceX and OneWeb. But access to invest in
these early-stage companies has largely been limited to private
investors in the past. Seraphim's IPO will allow retail investors to
take part with a minimum investment of just £1,000.

Scottish Mortgage fund manager Baillie Gifford, which favours investment
trusts as a way to offer retail investors access to private companies,
has also seen the attraction of space. Its small-cap trust, Edinburgh
Worldwide, took new stakes in two space companies in recent months.

"Through our existing private investments in SpaceX and Spire we have
witnessed first hand how the economics of accessing space and the
associated satellite and data opportunity are radically changing,"
Edinburgh Worldwide's managers said.

But small space start-ups risk failure before they become profitable.
OneWeb, a satellite internet company, dealt a blow to Britain's space
ambitions when it collapsed into bankruptcy last March, before being
rescued by theUK government and Indian billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal.

"The nature of the industry means the businesses [Seraphim] will invest
in are smallcap companies with less mature businesses so the risk
profile will be higher," said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and
markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

London listing offers retail investors access to companies that have
been difficult for them to invest in.

"We wanted to make access to space affordable to the man on the street.
You don't need to be a billionaire to invest," said Mark Boggett,
Seraphim's chief executive.

The launch comes amid growing interest in space companies from
investors, as enterprises such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's
Blue Origin push forward the commercialisation of space.

However, investment experts caution that retail investors should not
overload on spacerelated vehicles.

Boggett said the decline in the cost of satellites will bring a surge in
the number of orbiters collecting data about the Earth. That can be used
in businesses from predicting the weather to facilitating insurance
claims.

"Space is not about rockets and satellites. It's about a digital play,"
said Boggett. "The companies that we are investing in don't see
themselves as space infrastructure companies. They see themselves as
data companies."

Space is among the latest thematic investment opportunities to court
retail investors. Funds focused on niches such as renewable energy or
healthcare have drawn record inflows.

Worldwide, venture capital investment in space companies jumped 95 per
cent to $8.7bn in the year to March, according to Seraphim, including
the combined $4.2bn raised by SpaceX and OneWeb. But access to invest in
these early-stage companies has largely been limited to private
investors in the past. Seraphim's IPO will allow retail investors to
take part with a minimum investment of just £1,000.

Scottish Mortgage fund manager Baillie Gifford, which favours investment
trusts as a way to offer retail investors access to private companies,
has also seen the attraction of space. Its small-cap trust, Edinburgh
Worldwide, took new stakes in two space companies in recent months.

"Through our existing private investments in SpaceX and Spire we have
witnessed first hand how the economics of accessing space and the
associated satellite and data opportunity are radically changing,"
Edinburgh Worldwide's managers said.

But small space start-ups risk failure before they become profitable.
OneWeb, a satellite internet company, dealt a blow to Britain's space
ambitions when it collapsed into bankruptcy last March, before being
rescued by theUK government and Indian billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal.

"The nature of the industry means the businesses [Seraphim] will invest
in are smallcap companies with less mature businesses so the risk
profile will be higher," said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and
markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

New entrepreneurship course for job creators

Times of India (Electronic Edition)

August 17, 2020 Monday

Delhi Edition

Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Section: EDUCATION TIMES

Length: 377 words

Byline: c-Jagriti.Kumari@timesgroup.com

Highlight: With economy spiralling down, educational institutions need
to focus on entrepreneurship education to strengthen startup culture

Body

COURSE CURSOR

To encourage entrepreneurial ecosystem in campus, Savitribai Phule Pune
University (SPPU) decided to launch an online PG Diploma in
Entrepreneurship in association with Entrepreneurship Development
Institute of India (EDII).

Currently, the university is promoting entrepreneurship in electric
mobility, Artificial Intelligence (AI), agriculture, water and health
under Rashtriya Uchatar Shikshan Abhiyan (RUSA). “In addition to
strengthening the current entrepreneurship ecosystem on the campus, the
course will also help to create a pool of job creators. Just producing
graduates will lead to job seekers that will not be beneficial for the
development of the economy,” says Nitin R Karmalkar, vice chancellor,
SPPU. The newly launched course which is open to all graduates, says
Karmalkar is aimed to offer required eco-system, guidance needed to
nurture the budding entrepreneurs and start-ups in India.

“In view of the economic slowdown due to COVID-19, entrepreneurship is
vital for job creation and economic growth. The time has come to promote
the entrepreneurial talents and offer them a roadmap to implement their
ideas into reality,” he adds.

Why startups fail

Responding to question on failures of start-ups, Karmalkar says that it
is not because of the dearth of talent but absence of mentoring and the
regular analysis leads to collapse. Under the newly launched programme,
candidates will be taught about how to get funding, patenting, marketing
techniques etc. “To develop entrepreneurial spirit, we need to bring a
change in mindset. Everything has its own hiccups and entrepreneurship
is not prone to it. It should start in a structured manner to minimise
the failure,” he adds.

How did the idea come

Inspired by the IIT Madras incubation cell which offers help to
start-ups, Karmalkar decided to start the entrepreneurship education on
the campus. “Several industries are functional in and around Pune so
handson training, internship and other industry assistance will not be a
problem for candidates enrolled with the course. The university will
help them getting all kind of support,” he adds. SPPU is likely to start
the admission by the end of this month. The fee is yet to be decided.
However, he assures that it would be reasonable.

Should govt promote EV battery swapping?

It is still early days and policymakers should allow various models to
evolve before pushing for any particular option Recently, the government
allowed electric vehicles to be sold and registered without batteries.
The rationale behind the move, it explained, was to de-link the cost of
the battery from the vehicle cost. Battery accounts for 30-40 per cent
of an electric vehicle's cost and this move would bring down the upfront
cost of an electric two-wheeler or a three-wheeler at par or even lower
than those powered by internal combustion engine. By doing so, the
government is hoping to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles
whose penetration is still a low 1 per cent in the country.

The move received a mixed reaction. Some players called it a
short-sighted decision. They warned that it would lead to reliability
and accountability issues. Who will be responsible if a customer used a
cheap, poor quality battery and the vehicle caught fire? They wondered
loudly how selling an electric vehicle without a battery reduces the
acquisition cost. After all, a battery is needed for the vehicle to run.
They also pointed out that it is costlier to buy a battery separately as
its GST is higher at 18 per cent as against an electric vehicle's 5 per
cent.

A section of the industry, on the other hand, welcomed the move. They
pointed out that selling/registering a vehicle without a battery opens
up new ownership models. Some players like Ather Energy are already
experimenting such models where the cost of the vehicle does not include
the battery. Customers pay for it based on the number of kilometres they
run the vehicle, or on a monthly subscription basis or simply lease the
battery. This works well depending on the customer's usage pattern.
Those who use the vehicle occasionally opt for a per kilometre plan
while heavy users prefer lease. Technology allows the vehicle
manufacturers to keep track of the usage and accordingly bill the
customers.

However, even those who have welcomed the move are cautious as a lot
more clarity is required from the government. Most importantly, they all
would like to know what has motivated this decision. Is it to encourage
new ownership models or promote third party battery swapping technology?

Hectic lobbying There has been hectic lobbying to make India embrace
battery swapping on a large scale as a way to re-charge an electric
vehicle to supplement charging infrastructure which is costly and time
consuming to build. Battery swapping also saves time (one does not have
to spend hours charging the battery) and is productive (down-time of the
vehicle when it is charged is absent). Of course, it also reduces the
acquisition cost of the vehicle as the customer just pays for the
energy.

But a large scale third party battery swapping model has a distinct
disadvantage. It will be not be possible to implement it unless the
electric vehicle batteries are standardised. That is the problem.
Standardising the batteries, at this stage, when the technology is still
evolving will kill innovation. It can happen only if a technology or
design has matured. That is not the case with electric vehicle batteries
yet. The energy density, shape, size, mounting of the battery and its
communication with the battery management system are still evolving.

Each manufacturer approaches the battery differently. Some like Tesla
want it to be so intelligent that its operation and efficiency can be
monitored remotely for best performance. Standardisation will end all
this. Also, India is still in the early stage of battery development
value chain and setting standards now will be to the advantage of
foreign players notably Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers. It is they
who will dictate the standards that we will have to follow. And India's
attempt to achieve 'Aatmanirbharta' in this space will be lost.

As mentioned earlier, battery swapping as a model has its advantages but
till the battery technology matures, it makes sense for the government
to promote it in a manner where respective OEMs drive it. They can set
up their own swapping infrastructure and this will obviate the need for
standardisation for now.

This calibrated approach to battery swapping will help for another
reason. There is a belief that the potential for adoption in India could
be over-rated. Unlike in the US and Europe where almost all of the
electric vehicles are cars for personal mobility, India's scenario is
different. Here 80 per cent of the electric vehicles will be
two-wheelers. They would run on an average 20-40 kilometres a day and
can be easily charged at home, at night, for a few hours.
Three-wheelers, which will account for another 5 per cent, typically
average 150 km a day and they too can run on a single charge in most
case. It is unclear as to what percentage of users in these two
categories would prefer battery swapping.

That leaves the four-wheelers. Initially, it will be the fleet operators
who will be deploying electric vehicles. FAME-II, the policy that
promotes use of electric vehicles through subsidies, promotes public
transport. Here again, fleet operators would be setting up charging
infrastructure in their premises. Also, swapping a car battery is a
laborious process as accessing it is not easy. It would require heavy
investment in equipment/tools. Better Place, a start-up in Israel, tried
it between 2007 and 2013 and eventually went bust. While its founder
Shai Agassi may have been way ahead of time with the idea of swapping
batteries, the start-up's failure also highlights the challenges
involved in the model.

Considering all these challenges, it is better if the government allows
various models to evolve before promoting anyone of them. As a country
India has to embrace electric vehicles. That is the only way by which it
can adhere to its commitment of reducing carbon intensity by 35 per cent
before 2030. Also, shifting away from fossil fuel increases India's
energy security. Any attempt to push through a particular model in a
hurry and the resultant fallout, if any, could cause customers to lose
faith in electric vehicles. That will be big setback not only for the
government but for the country as well.

battery) and is productive (down-time of the vehicle when it is charged
is absent). Of course, it also reduces the acquisition cost of the
vehicle as the customer just pays for the energy.But a large scale third
party battery swapping model has a distinct disadvantage. It will be not
be possible to implement it unless the electric vehicle batteries are
standardised. That is the problem. Standardising the batteries, at this
stage, when the technology is still evolving will kill innovation. It
can happen only if a technology or design has matured. That is not the
case with electric vehicle batteries yet. The energy density, shape,
size, mounting of the battery and its communication with the battery
management system are still evolving.Each manufacturer approaches the
battery differently. Some like Tesla want it to be so intelligent that
its operation and efficiency can be monitored remotely for best
performance. Standardisation will end all this. Also, India is still in
the early stage of battery development value chain and setting standards
now will be to the advantage of foreign players notably Chinese and
Taiwanese manufacturers. It is they who will dictate the standards that
we will have to follow. And India's attempt to achieve 'Aatmanirbharta'
in this space will be lost.As mentioned earlier, battery swapping as a
model has its advantages but till the battery technology matures, it
makes sense for the government to promote it in a manner where
respective OEMs drive it. They can set up their own swapping
infrastructure and this will obviate the need for standardisation for
now.This calibrated approach to battery swapping will help for another
reason. There is a belief that the potential for adoption in India could
be over-rated. Unlike in the US and Europe where almost all of the
electric vehicles are cars for personal mobility, India's scenario is
different. Here 80 per cent of the electric vehicles will be
two-wheelers. They would run on an average 20-40 kilometres a day and
can be easily charged at home, at night, for a few hours.
Three-wheelers, which will account for another 5 per cent, typically
average 150 km a day and they too can run on a single charge in most
case. It is unclear as to what percentage of users in these two
categories would prefer battery swapping.That leaves the four-wheelers.
Initially, it will be the fleet operators who will be deploying electric
vehicles. FAME-II, the policy that promotes use of electric vehicles
through subsidies, promotes public transport. Here again, fleet
operators would be setting up charging infrastructure in their premises.
Also, swapping a car battery is a laborious process as accessing it is
not easy. It would require heavy investment in equipment/tools. Better
Place, a start-up in Israel, tried it between 2007 and 2013 and
eventually went bust. While its founder Shai Agassi may have been way
ahead of time with the idea of swapping batteries, the start-up's
failure also highlights the challenges involved in the model.Considering
all these challenges, it is better if the government allows various
models to evolve before promoting anyone of them. As a country India has
to embrace electric vehicles. That is the only way by which it can
adhere to its commitment of reducing carbon intensity by 35 per cent
before 2030. Also, shifting away from fossil fuel increases India's
energy security. Any attempt to push through a particular model in a
hurry and the resultant fallout, if any, could cause customers to lose
faith in electric vehicles. That will be big setback not only for the
government but for the country as well.

7 reasons why 81 pc of Indian startups face failure

The last few years have been a rollercoaster ride for the entire startup
ecosystem, with most founders going back to regular jobs and only a few
going on for sustenance. Shortlisted from the many reasons why startups
fail, these are the key seven:

Lack of vision

The first task is to know where you need to reach. One of the most
important things is to have a vision and a bigger goal that people can
look up to, especially when times are tough. This unites people in a
single thread, in both the good times and the bad. This is important for
startups with young founders, as they usually take some time to step up
to the leadership challenge that entrepreneurship requires.

Lack of market understanding

Yes! Something as basic as this can be quite challenging to crack.
Knowing the market, where you stand, and how you need to reach your
goals is important for any founder. Scale, urgency, opportunity, and
utility are of paramount importance here. Scale refers to the breadth of
the user problem that is being solved. Utility and urgency are for the
solution on offer and if it's addressing a core need, or is only a
good-to-have solution. Is it easy to use and can it address any loose
ends that come with such a solution? Opportunity refers to the business
opportunity. Are the solution and the working mechanism of the solution
scalable to grow into a self-sustaining ecosystem, or it a stop-gap
arrangement? There have been too many startups which went in head-on
without a grip on the numbers and failed as a result.

Poor competency

Till you are bootstrapping, founders running the show is fine. But, the
moment you raise funding, founders should do a hard
skill-competency-interest appraisal of themselves and decide what roles
they will assign to themselves. I fully subscribe to founders being the
best product/sales/marketing managers as they've been living and
dreaming their business from inception. But a word of caution here -
this does not make them the best people to run the show. Usually, it is
about interest, temperament, and domain expertise. The faster founders
discover their strengths, the faster they will get the right people on
board.

I see too many startups wasting 12-24 months and precious capital in
learning the basics and then hiring specialists. Sometimes, it is too
little, too late.

For the first few years, entrepreneurship is about 'betting on people'.
'Team' is the business, at least, for the first few years. If your score
is 8-9 out of 10, you will build a good/great business. This only
happens when you tell your key people that you have their 'back
protected', irrespective of the outcome. Even Tendulkar did not score a
century in every innings, yet someone kept on backing him and giving him
chances.

Poor execution

Online, offline, or hybrid - it is the execution quality of the business
which wins or loses. In an economy like India, where businesses take
8-10 years to turn into a solid business model, there have been several
gaping holes which make businesses fail. Attracting the right people for
the right jobs is a very basic problem. There are both tangible fields
(like production) and intangible fields (like brand solutions) which
need to be handled by an expert. Vice-versa, expertise cannot work
through. The daily experience of a brand, via the product for both in-
and field-office teams, is a major miss because criteria are set on x
number of hours rather than the targets, which probably need lesser or
more hours.

Revenue models and data-based execution is also missing in several
startups because of the lack of understanding of how resource allocation
needs to be done. Data-based executions also take a back-seat due to an
unnecessary belief that 'their' (the founder's) thought process is the
only right way. Another unfortunate miss is the lack of decision-based
training and delegation. Since people come from a delegation model, the
decision process is slower, and this lack of empowerment leads to delays
and lack of accountabilities.

Excessive focus on weaknesses

Exerting more on the strengths rather than concentrating on the
weaknesses is a novice folly. Since most founders are first-timers, this
is a fault which takes their focus away from the job at hand. A thorough
SWOT analysis of different periods of a startup's growth will show the
weaknesses and strengths. The strengths need to be amplified to the
extent that weaknesses can be relegated to a nondescript corner.
Similarly, for the founders, if they identify a weakness within
themselves, they should hire the right resources who have that as a
strength, so that they can focus on their own strengths.

Every founder cannot be the CEO

There can be only one CEO, even if there are many founders. Only one
person sets the vision, and the others execute after there is broad
agreement over what needs to be done. Too many people trying to display
the big picture is a waste of time and shows role ambiguity. "Too many
cooks spoil the broth" comes in when everybody is the boss. Direction
comes from a single person and that position must be stable, secure, and
given space to experiment, with a reasonable error margin.

Meritocracy

This should be ruthlessly executed from the top down. The agenda is to
build a business and not protect anyone. Right people doing the right
task is the only way to build a business. With a well-laid appraisal
mechanism, talent must be timely rewarded and given a greater platform
so that they feel as much as a part of the venture as the founders. It
takes 8-10 years to build a good/great business, and without a
performing team which sticks around, it is simply not possible.

Why Wakefit's Ankit Garg believes experimentation, finding the
product-market fit, and validation are vital

In this episode of 100X Entrepreneur Podcast, Ankit Garg, Director and
Co-founder of Wakefit, talks about his entrepreneurial journey, his
failures and successes, and starting up Wakefit.

Ankit Garg, Director and Co-founder of Wakefit, believes that it is
better to fail in the early stages after starting up rather than after
some time because it would mean "devastation of the whole thing".

Failure is part and parcel of an entrepreneur's journey. Ankit has
learned this the hard way - his first startup shut down within six
months of its launch.

After working at an MNC as a salesman for four years, Ankit wanted to
build something of his own. Months of research led him to develop a
differentiated way of making foam for the automotive industry. He
launched this in the market; the product was well received and he
secured funding immediately to set up a factory.

However, the growth didn't last long as another big MNC working in the
same segment entered India and Ankit lost his customer base.

"I was capable of selling my product at 160 per kg with profits. In the
first month, we were at Rs 10 lakh and then Rs 20 lakh and Rs 25 lakh
but then a big MNC came in and they were cooking (working on) almost the
same strategies that I was but at a very large scale.

"They happened to come with this strategy in India and disrupt me. I
couldn't sell our product and within six months of starting up, I had to
kind of wind up. That became the worst phase of my life," he says.

Ankit reveals that the incident pushed him into depression. He went then
went to Mumbai where he survived by selling pasta on the roadside and
eventually began working at a startup.

What led to Wakefit?

Later in 2014-15, while Ankit was looking for a job, he visited a D2C
brand's showroom to purchase a mattress. Having worked as a B2B chemical
salesman, he knew that mattresses worth Rs 2,000 were often sold at Rs
10,000.

"That was a moment I realised that the industry was very inefficient and
something was broken in the entire supply chain. I decided to work on
mattresses as a piece. But with my previous experience of failing one
time, I think I learned the very hard way thatyou must innovate, test in
the market, and only then look further," he says.

Ankit began with the idea of selling mattresses in December 2014 while
working a day job. After a year of experimentation, finding the right
product-market fit, validation, saving up, and accumulating funds, he
decided to pursue the business and officially launched Wakefit in 2016.

"You might have heard a lot of advice that one should 100 percent work
on a startup and one can't be working at the same time. I think very
differently. I feel there is no shame in working as an employee and
spending time on building ideas probably over the weekend. I literally
did that from December 2014," he says.

Today, Wakefit is one of the most popular D2C brands in India. It
recorded 2X growth in one year, clocking in Rs 410 crore revenue, and is
on track to register Rs 700 crore in annual revenue.

All Wakefit products are manufactured in-house across nine factories in
Bengaluru, Jodhpur, and Delhi. It mostly sells its products online via
Amazon and its own website, and also has more than 22 experience
centres.

failures and successes, and starting up Wakefit.

Has the appetite for plant-based meat already peaked?

Neil Rankin is an unlikely plant-based food entrepreneur. The
45-year-old Scot made his name spearheading London’s barbecue restaurant
boom a decade ago, serving up steaks, ribs and whole carcasses cooked on
open fires.

After deciding that serving even sustainably reared meat would do little
to reverse the environmental impact of the industry, he pivoted to vegan
burgers and sausages, developing his product in his home kitchen. “I’ve
cooked millions of steaks over the past 10 years or so. I think I’ve
come to the end of [cooking meat] and plant-based is just so uncharted,”
he says.

Eschewing the use of protein processed from legumes such as soya or
peas, favoured by many makers of plant-based meat, his quest for a
sustainable alternative using vegetables led him to a vegan “meat” using
fermented onions, beets and mushrooms.

Rankin’s company Symplicity Foods is now supplying premium burger chains
and restaurants in the UK, including Gordon Ramsay’s Street Burger
outlets, Soho House, the private members club, and Indian eatery
Dishoom. After completing a £2m fundraising round it has just opened a
bigger production facility in north London.

Bean patties and tofu burgers have been around for decades, but consumer
interest in the new generation of plant-based meats, mimicking the
taste, texture and smell of animal meat, surged around the flotation of
US start-up Beyond Meat in 2019.

But the push by Rankin coincides with a faltering in sales growth in the
sector. After a 46 per cent rise in 2020 on the back of soaring demand
at the start of the pandemic, sales in plant-based meat in the US in
2021 fell 0.5 per cent, according to data provider SPINS. In the UK,
Kantar numbers show that sales tailed off in the second half of last
year, although in December they experienced a rebound.

“We have probably had a bit of a hype cycle, with an awful lot of people
trying things once or twice,” says Will Hayllar, global managing partner
of OC&C Strategy Consultants. “That has driven very rapid growth.”

The slowdown in growth has taken some executives by surprise. Many had
anticipated that the continuing anxiety over climate change and the
environmental cost of the meat industry — which accounts for 15 per cent
of global carbon emissions — would act as a major spur for plant-based
faux meat. Created with the help of biochemists and molecular
scientists, it offers a way of cutting meat intake without sacrificing
something that many consumers crave and love.

“This category has decelerated across the board,” Michael McCain, chief
executive of Maple Leaf Foods, told analysts in November as he announced
a review of the Canadian group’s plant-based meat business. Investors
have also been unnerved by Beyond Meat’s performance and its relatively
subdued US revenue outlook, blamed on a range of issues from
Covid-related labour shortages to outages at its facilities. Its shares
now trade at about a quarter of its 2019 peak and the lossmaking group’s
market capitalisation, once above $15bn, has slipped below $4bn.

Rankin believes the ebbing of the sales surge is down to products which
fail to meet taste expectations. “There are a lot of people that have
moved to plant-based because of sustainability issues, but yet they
aren’t really satisfied with what’s out there,” he says. Price has also
been an issue as plant-based meat makers have struggled to get repeat
purchases from customers once the initial excitement has died down.

Primetime audition

During the pandemic, plant-based meat had its “big audition” which
triggered the large jump in sales in 2020, says Arlin Wasserman, founder
of food strategy consultancy Changing Tastes. But long term that seems
to have actually worked against the category, especially in the US.

Buying in large quantities during the lockdowns highlighted “the
shortcomings of next-generation plant-based meats”, Wasserman adds. He
blames the long list of ingredients with unfamiliar names for making the
product look like highly processed food and acting as a barrier to
repeat purchases.

“Consumers may buy it once, but after reading the label, slow down their
purchases,” he says.

In a Changing Tastes survey of 3,000 adults in the US in December, about
40 per cent said they did not eat plant-based meats or would not eat
them in the future despite 39 per cent saying they wanted to reduce
their red meat consumption. “It’s an extremely high negative for such a
new idea,” says Wasserman.

Clues as to whether plant-based meat is just another fad might be found
in the “Gartner hype cycle” of emerging technologies, say agritech
consultants and investment experts. Developed by the US research and
consultancy group, the curve illustrates what it says are the five
phases in the lifecycle of a new technology — the initial surge in
expectations and then disappointment when it does not deliver, leading
to consolidation or company failures, improved product, and finally
mainstream adoption.

Many innovations, including mobile phones, artificial intelligence and
electric vehicles follow the cycle. Plant-based meat along with other
agri-technologies, such as insects for food and vertical farming, can be
plotted against the same curve, says Henry Gordon-Smith, founder of
consultancy Agritecture. For plant-based meat, “we are over the peak and
already into the ‘trough of disillusionment’.” Gordon-Smith
characterises this as a period where start-up failures and industry
consolidation lead to improved efficiencies, stronger players and better
products, fuelling renewed growth.

The sustainability reasons for reducing consumption of meat — the
production of which also contributes to land degradation and water
pollution — remain compelling, with the global population predicted to
rise by another 2bn before 2050. Continuing investment is being made
into alternative proteins, with $3bn raised globally by plant-based
start-ups in 2021, up 74 per cent from a year earlier, according to data
group PitchBook.

Massimo Zucchero, head of plant-based meal solutions at Nestlé, the
world’s largest food group, blames slower US sales growth on reduced
media interest and retailers rethinking their strategies and
reorganising shelf space. In Europe there is high double-digit growth
across most countries, he says. “Yes, there has been a slowdown. [But]
the market is going to start growing again.”  

Nestlé estimates the value of the plant-based meat category to be around
$8bn in terms of sales, with potential growth of around 20 per cent per
annum across the next five years.

Hanneke Faber, president of Unilever’s foods division, echoes Zucchero.
She too believes that the US phenomenon is temporary and predicts that
“going forward this market will continue to grow in the 20 per cent
range” every year.

Whether such projections are more than wishful thinking remains unclear.
It is easy to eat a plant-based burger at a restaurant, but breaking a
shopping habit and wondering if other family members will join in is
more difficult, says Hayllar.

“Changing people’s meal consumption habits, changing the way they cook,
that tends to be a slower thing to happen.”

The fight for the ‘centre of the plate’

For large food companies, plant-based proteins have widened the
opportunity to compete for what they call the “centre of the plate” in
western markets, which have for decades been dominated by meat
processors and farmers. Now, multinationals are racing to build a
business in plant-based protein alternatives, as well as investing for
the future in lab-grown meat.

At a tasting event on a floating hotel in London last year, Nestle’s
chief executive Mark Schneider predicted that every animal protein would
over time have a plant-based alternative as he introduced the company’s
latest faux shrimp and egg products, as well as plant-based sausages,
mince and chicken alternatives. Fake ham and smoked salmon are also
under development.

Hayllar says plant-based protein appeals to consumer goods makers such
as Nestlé and Unilever because it is branded, not commodified, enabling
them to tap into their marketing strengths and create price
differentiation between premium and everyday versions of the product.
“One of the interesting things about the [worldwide] shift to
plant-based is that it’s been a brand-led move, whereas in a market like
the UK the meat is almost all private label [or unbranded] . . . one of
the appeals for businesses . . . is that they can market [these
products] to shift consumer behaviour,” he adds.

Investing in alternative proteins, including plant-based meats, also
offers larger companies the opportunity to burnish their environmental
credentials for investors. “It’s one thing they can add to their annual
report helping reputational gains. Some see it as a social cost to
operate,” says JP Frossard, consumer foods analyst at Rabobank in New
York.

Investor advisory and research network Fairr — Farm Animal Investment
Risk and Return — backed by institutional investors managing about
$47tn, has called on food and meat companies as well as restaurants and
retailers to increase their alternative protein offerings to enhance
returns and mitigate future supply risk.

Continuous spending on research and development into areas from taste
and texture to health and nutrition is needed to make meaningful inroads
into plant-based foods and maintain consumer interest, say executives.
Unilever, for example, spent €85m on a food innovation research centre
at the Wageningen University campus in the Netherlands, with a focus on
plant-based ingredients and meat alternatives and other products such as
ice cream and mayonnaise, according to Faber.

Frossard says: “You’re not going to survive unless you continue research
for a better product — focus needs to be on affordability and taste.”

At a tasting event at a restaurant in London’s Leicester Square, more
than 100 of the city’s chefs last November marked the arrival of the
latest innovation from Israeli start-up Redefine Meat. The company
became the first to commercially launch a “structured” plant-based meat,
and the chefs tucked into dishes including “beef cut au poivre” and
“lamb cut la Dijonnaise” made from meat produced via a 3D printer.

For the large part, faux meat products have been those made from
ingredients pushed through an extruder to resemble mince. Apart from
cracking the “holy grail” of cuts of meat, Redefine co-founder Eshchar
Ben-Shitrit believes the start-up has worked out how to reproduce the
juiciness of real meat.

The next big thing in alternative proteins will be the eventual
commercial launch of meats made from cow, pig and chicken cells grown in
vats. Although not vegetarian, they are expected to generate lower
emissions than live animals. Having gained the world’s first regulatory
approval in Singapore in 2020, entrepreneurs behind lab-grown meat are
hoping that sometime this year, US food authorities will give it the
nod.

Despite the dystopian images of scientists creating meat in
laboratories, many consumers in the west seem oblivious to the rise of
technology in food, say analysts. R&D has long been a feature in the
food industry, with tastes, smells and textures carefully analysed and
developed.     

“I don’t think many consumers will be put off by the food being invented
in a laboratory with some exceptions,” says Wasserman. “So it’s more
about how it is produced after it’s invented.”

Seaweed and fermented tomatoes

Executives and analysts believe that the opportunities are too big for
plant-based meat to be a flash in the pan. Indeed, the Good Food
Institute, a lobbying and consultancy group for alternative proteins,
believes that the industry will need five to 10 times more production
capacity by 2030 to satisfy demand.

Nestlé sees various opportunities in the category, including emerging
markets, especially in Asia where vegan protein-rich products such as
tofu have been around for centuries and where consumers are discovering
new plant-based foods.

Another area is a whole different plant-based segment that does not try
to mimic meat. This is about “putting vegetables at the heart of, the
centre of the plate, in a delicious way,” says Zucchero. His colleague
Wayne England, head of food strategy at Nestlé, says demand for meat
will need to be satisfied by alternative sources because current levels
of consumption are not environmentally sustainable. “There is so much
more to come to the category,” he says, “the world cannot feed itself
with so much meat.”

It is not just the multinationals pushing R&D efforts. On the other end
of the spectrum, Rankin says he is busy with development of his own.

He is working on a healthy fat using seaweed and fermented tomatoes and
is also looking at the byproducts from his manufacturing process,
including the liquid that comes off the fermentation of vegetables which
might be turned into products such as gravy. Turning leftover sourdough
bread into miso instead of importing the soyabean-based condiment from
Japan is another project.

“There’s so much that I don’t think I’m going to get it done in the next
year, so I think I’m going to be at this for a fair while,” he says.

Consumers will return to plant-based meats once the products evolve,
says Rankin. “The interest [in plant-based meat] isn’t waning,” he adds.
“I [just] think the product has not quite caught up with the interest
yet.”

about the inspiration that led him to set up CoinnDCX.

"I was born in a small village in Madhya Pradesh and always thought
about how to do bigger things in life. My approach was always to accept
challenges and this philosophy is now reflected in the vision of
CoinDCX, which is about doing something valuable for the country and
then taking it to the global stage" said Gupta.

"My biggest learning happened during my IIT days where I met my
co-founder Neeraj too. When you start your business it may not work the
way you want it to work, this happened with my first venture. The
failure of my first start-up taught me some crucial lessons", he added.

Speaking about the vision of his new venture CoinDCX, Gupta says that
the idea was to enter a niche space where there was the possibility of
bigger returns and a larger impact.

"We all believe in the power of decentralised finance and how blockchain
can help in achieving that. We know the internet in India has deeper
penetration and we realised India has a higher potential in terms of
innovations, especially in fintech and crypto has a lot to offer in this
space. We went about thinking about how to build India as a base to lead
global blockchain and crypto. We solved problems like making investments
in crypto simpler, and then we started educating people about crypto
free of cost."

According to Gupta, when you are in a space, which is new, you tend to
face multiple challenges not just in terms of tech products, but also in
terms of legal, regulatory compliance, hiring etc.

"We are in the process of making crypto mainstream. I think your job as
a company is not to just sell your services but also to make sure your
end-users understand it and get educated in the process. I am very
excited about what the future holds for crypto entrepreneurs and the
crypto enthusiasts in the country. Though there are still uncertainties,
as people say "when nothing is sure, everything is possible", he
explained.

When asked to demystify crypto for a layperson and share the overview of
the crypto ecosystem, Gupta said that it was crucial for people to start
getting exposure in this space.

"Crypto is a largely unregulated space. We are right now in the
infrastructure phase of this technology. Right now if you see globally,
the infrastructure is being built up. I think people need to link it
with the real world, make a small investment, and start reading about
it. Though the interfaces in crypto are not very simple and the space is
new, it's often tough for people to understand the way it works and that
is the reason we have started the DCXLearn platform", he shared.

"In future, you will see decentralised applications being built around
blockchain. I think in the next one or two years, when governments will
start regulating crypto, you will see an inflection point and that is
when you will see more competition and innovation too", he further
added.

Speaking about the best ways of building brands in a new environment,
Gupta said, "I believe two things are very important----you have look
beyond your personal benefits and you have to grow the category. It also
means you have to solve multiple problems and that is the way to build
strong brands in a new environment."

Gig workforce witness 5X demand growth after mass layoffs: Report

MINT

February 25, 2023 Saturday

Length: 657 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Feb. 25 -- Due to its short-term contracts or temporary
labour with flexibility and freedom of workculture but no job security,
India's gig economy is the sector of the workforce that is expanding at
the fastest rate. Due to the agility, skill set, and lower cost of
freelancers, organizations in today's digital age are altering their
business models to draw in an increasing number of them. The Taskmo Gig
Index (TGI) demonstrates that the post-layoff employment market is
seeing tremendous growth in hiring demand for the Indian gig economy.

According to a Taskmo study, the platform's user base grew by 21% last
month, while demand from recruiters saw a 5X spike in January 2023.
While metro cities continue to retain the growing momentum for gig
workers, it is encouraging to observe that prominent recruiters have
established their roots throughout Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities like Indore,
Bhopal, Ranchi, Lucknow, and Vadodara, which are picking up their route
to gig jobs. Since that companies are extending their geographic reach
outside metro areas by establishing additional offices in smaller towns,
Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities have noticed an uptick in the demand for gigs.
Using a tech-driven strategy, recruiters are going above and beyond to
entice applicants from smaller cities, offering multilingual assistance,
job tracking and monitoring tools, as well as payment simplicity.
Furthermore, since many occupations may now be performed remotely,
location is no longer a deciding factor.

The majority of gig workers are professionals who have had to develop
new routines and methods of working since they are unable to secure jobs
with long-term hiring commitments. They are no longer young individuals
searching for seasonal labour. Gig workers are self-employed individuals
who do not have an employer and do jobs independently or through third
parties. The main benefit for companies hiring these workers is that it
costs less than hiring permanent employees due to lower salaries, taxes,
benefits, etc, the study report of Taskmo says.

Indian companies are rapidly searching for gig partners to cover
responsibilities in tech gigs, content moderators, business development,
telecallers, brand promotion, and micro-influencers as the digital
upheaval sparked by the global pandemic continuously overhauls the
marketing landscape. Another segment of laid-off employees decided to
try their success in the gig economy, a new employment trend that has
emerged as a result of the failure of start-ups. Almost 15 million gig
workers are employed in India, and the gig economy is expanding quickly
to meet the demands of millennials, Gen Z, and Y employees.

"As India moves toward becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025, the gig
economy serves as a building block that helps the economy achieve the
final goal of eradicating the gap between unemployment and income.
Freelancers, cleaners, delivery executives, bloggers, consultants, etc
are a part of the gig economy. In recent times, most gig jobs are
platform enabled, which also gives gig workers the flexibility to work
for more than one contractor," Taskmo study report says.

The rapidly growing gig economy has made significant progress and given
the Indian economy advantages in terms of productivity and employment.
Most gig tech platforms have seen a rise in demand for gig workers
throughout Quick commerce, Healthtech, Fintech, and E-commerce sectors
amid concerns over startup layoffs, funding shortages, and shutdowns.

As per a report by NITI Aayog titled 'India's Booming Gig and Platform
Economy' for 2020-21, in 2020- 21, 77 lakh (7.7 million) workers were
engaged in the gig economy and gig workforce is expected to expand to
2.35 crore (23.5 million) workers by 2029-30.

What's the least glamorous 'P' of product marketing?

The Afaqs Reporter

January 09 -- Product distribution requires physical efforts and
effective distribution is the only tactic which helps you win the moment
of truth. The biggest dissonance a brand can face is non-availability
within arm's reach of its target group / consumer (TG / TC). Every other
dissonance is secondary and / or subsequent to this dissonance.

This is also the same aspect that differentiates product marketing from
service marketing - at its most basic level. The advent of technology
has benefited service distribution the most. However, it has not yet
fully solved the hardships of physical product distribution. Owing to
this, we have seen multiple start-ups which have achieved Unicorn
status, have largely been offering Services. There are very few in the
product marketing start-up space and even fewer or zilch that have
achieved Unicorn status. Of course, I am not labelling any of these
start-ups as failures. In fact, many of them are successful and have a
profitable business model (already!) - unlike their services
counterparts who are busy inflating just three KPIs - valuations, GMVs
and losses!

 

 

Specifically, in the Indian context, the dominant mix of general trade
channel to most product categories has been an aspect that makes things
extremely challenging (for organisations) on multiple fronts...

1. Upfront investments and expenses to establish pan-India footprint.

- This gets further complicated when organisations also aspire to
establish omni-channel presence

2. Reasonably high and recurring fixed costs.

3. Manpower intensive.

4. Dependency on third party partnerships (CFAs, distributors, etc.) for
last-mile execution.

5. Average square feet space available per retail outlet - this is too
low, already over-flowing and expands at a snail's pace. Thus, product /
category / brand / line expansions and / or extensions are challenging
to Launch → Establish → Sustain → Generate absolute and / or desired
incremental top-line.

- Cannibalisation effect seeps in (not with consumer, but with
shelf-space, retailer / distributor stocking, etc.), within no time of
launch.

6. Low RPO - Revenue Per Outlet (drop-size) - Average top-line per
retail delivery is very low for India (amongst comparable size of
economies).

7. Lack of scan data (consumer off-take) from a dominant channel
(general trade).

8. Market research data collection is complex and challenging and is
based on a certain sample size.

a. This makes it prone to error owing to human interference, design bias
and / or inadequate representation.

b. Sample sets are changed at a pre-defined frequency. Thus, macro
change might take time to seep into the data.

c. However, this is one area where technology has also evolved -
especially for capturing data, for quicker analysis, throwing up
anomalies (faster than ever) and for overall decision making.

d. The time has come for this piece to be automated to the next level -
that is, retail outlets, who are part of the sample, have simple
technological solutions that capture data on a daily basis (rather than
once a month visits from the data collector).

9. Revenue Management / Pack-Price Play (by sales channels) are not a
fully evolved science. That is, they are not "way of life" for most
organisations.

a. Largely, same set of SKU(s) are launched across all the channels.

b. Over a period of time, consumer off-take decides the dominant channel
for that set of SKU(s).

c. However, recently, we are seeing increasing trend towards
channel-specific launches.

i. This is happening more in the premium space where modern retail and
e-comm channels act as rightful vent. The reason is that these channels
provide ease of product placement (fewer number of customers for deal
making, fewer locations for physical delivery) and quick data collation
towards actual off-takes.

ii. This also solves the P&L pressures that many brands / marketers
might be facing from their regular business (provided the planned
volumes are achieved).

10. "Rural" - the buzzword that everyone wants to crack. However, this
requires clear answers to a few pertinent questions...

a. Which set of current and future SKUs are relevant for rural markets?

b. What is the distribution set-up / design for catering to rural
markets? Is it physical (direct) or through activating wholesale
(indirect) or both?

c. How will the organisation maintain sanctity of pricing (across its
entire offering for rural) so that there is no channel conflict?

d. What capability interventions are being planned for sales teams -
internal team as well as external team?

e. Is the organisation going to have a dedicated rural sales vertical?
If yes, what is the minimum horizon for which the organisation is
committing the added costs for this structure?

f. What are the POS solutions designed for deployment in rural markets?

g. What BTL activations are designed specifically for the rural markets?
In fact, what is the BTL calendar for the rural markets?

h. At each level in the organisation, what are the KPIs to be tracked
and reviewed? How will the performance scorecard reflect the "Rural"
delivery?

Unlike any media vehicle, distribution can't be bought (especially, the
one we expect to stick around for a while). It must be built -
painstakingly, day in and day out - with perseverance, rigour,
passionate reviews and dispassionate feedback / course correction. Any
and every spend on the brand is futile, if distribution is not in place.

Retrophin Announces Expansion of Intellectual Property Estate for
Sparsentan with Newly Issued U.S. Patent

Contify Life Science News

June 14 -- Retrophin, Inc. (NASDAQ:RTRX) today announced that the United
States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued a new patent
covering the Company's product candidate sparsentan which, in addition
to being in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), is advancing to Phase 3 clinical
development for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). U.S. Patent No.
9,993,461 expands the Company's current intellectual property by
providing coverage for the use of sparsentan in the treatment of IgAN
and broadening the existing coverage to include all doses of sparsentan
between 200 and 800 mg/day. The patent has a stated expiration date of
March 30, 2030.

"We are very pleased to broaden the intellectual property coverage for
sparsentan with this newly issued patent in the United States," said
Stephen Aselage, chief executive officer of Retrophin. "As we advance
our development efforts, this patent will help us position sparsentan as
a first-in-class therapy for people living with FSGS, as well as those
living with IgA nephropathy, and further support our efforts to deliver
a novel treatment option for these rare disorders with significant unmet
needs."

About Sparsentan

Sparsentan's dual mechanism of action combines angiotensin receptor
blockade with endothelin receptor type A blockade. In several forms of
chronic kidney disease, endothelin receptor blockade has been shown to
have an additive beneficial effect on proteinuria in combination with
renin-angiotensin blockade via angiotensin receptor blockade or
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

In April 2018, Retrophin initiated the pivotal Phase 3 DUPLEX Study of
sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS, a disease with no U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacological therapies. The study
includes an interim efficacy endpoint based on proteinuria to serve as
the basis for a New Drug Application (NDA) filing for Subpart H
accelerated approval of sparsentan in FSGS. Sparsentan has been granted
orphan drug designation for the treatment of FSGS by the FDA and
European Commission.

The Company is also advancing the development of sparsentan in IgA
nephropathy, a rare immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis
characterized by proteinuria and variable rates of progressive renal
failure. Study start-up activities are underway in anticipation of
initiating a pivotal study in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Mapping, preparing, and bouncing back from failure - how founders can
gear up for the bumpy journey of entrepreneurship

The emotional, social, and economic costs of startup failure can be
severe. This must-read book shows founders how to map the failure
landscape - and gear up for success.

Launched in 2012, YourStory's Book Review section features over 320
titles on creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and digital
transformation. See also our related columns The Turning Point, Techie
Tuesdays, and Storybites.

While much can be learned from startup success stories, there is a lot
to learn from failures, mistakes, misfortune, lapses, and bad judgment.
Forewarned is forearmed, and the lessons of hindsight and research can
help founders avoid failures on their part as well.

Frameworks, stories, and lessons from startup failures are brilliantly
captured in the book Fail-Safe Startup by Tom Eisenmann, professor at
Harvard Business School. He has taught courses on launching and scaling
tech ventures, entrepreneurial sales and marketing, and entrepreneurial
failure.

Here are my key takeaways from this must-read 350-page book, summarised,
as well in the tables below. See also my reviews of the related books
The Other 'F' Word, The Messy Middle, Who Blunders and How, Adapt, The
Up Side of Down, The Wisdom of Failure, Fail Better, Fail Fast, and
Failing to Succeed.

News of mistakes rarely makes it to the press, but fortunately, there
are conferences like FailCon that help entrepreneurs analyse failure.
See also my articles on Eight lessons in failure from Amani Institute's
Fail Faire and Exit Plan B: Where is your parachute? 15 tips for winding
down your startup.

The book shares in-depth examples of failures of seven startups for
reasons like the false promise (misplaced confidence from early
success), false start (premature launch), and audacious goals
(unsuccessful moonshots).

The material is thoroughly referenced (with 22 pages of notes and
citations), and a 20-page appendix describes the systematic survey to
which 470 startups responded. In many cases, the founders themselves
participated in the professor's classroom discussions, providing a
wealth of first-hand insights.

Foundations

Tom uses the HBS definition of entrepreneurship: pursuing novel
opportunity while lacking resources. "A venture has failed if its early
investors did not - or never will - get back more money than they put
in," he adds.

In the bigger scheme of things, a startup can be struck by misfortune or
circumstances beyond its control (e.g. competitor product, pandemic). A
"good failure" is one that yields valuable spillover insights for
society and the founders' future journey, even if the startup shuts down
(as seen in the social robot startup Jibo).

Entrepreneurial risk comes from lack of customer demand, inadequate tech
systems, poor execution, and finance shortages. Failures are generally
attributed to the "horse" (company, competition) or "jockey" (founder,
team), Tom observes, while cautioning that there are multiple
inter-related factors at play.

I. Early-stage failures

Tom uses an opportunity-resource framework to describe the startup
landscape. The opportunity is akin to the horse, and the resources are
the jockeys and other stakeholders. These issues and tradeoffs need to
be weighed carefully and often in the startup's journey.

1. Catch-22

The customer value proposition of the startup's offering must be
compelling enough to overcome switching costs and build network effects.
Single segments are quicker and easier to target but may yield less
revenue than multiple segments.

"Customers are drawn to products that balance novelty with familiarity,"
Tom explains.

High-touch solutions offer differentiation but entail higher operating
costs and difficulties in scaling. "Big bang" marketing launches can
drive growth but are expensive.

Founder teams should have diversity ("hacker and hustler"). Confidence
fuels resilience and attracts resources, but overconfidence can lead to
too much risk and inability to pivot, Tom cautions.

He cites the work of Eric Ries in The Lean Startup, which defines a
startup's runway in terms of the number of pivots that can be completed
before cash runs out.

On the talent front, skilled specialists boost performance, but may not
fit into the startup culture. Those hired for attitude can ensure
loyalty and enforce culture, but may not work well as the company scales
and needs more standardisation, Tom observes.

On the investor front, there are challenges in raising too soon or too
late. Investors should be chosen if they have a good track record and
can provide a bridge round under duress, Tom suggests.

Having corporate partners helps, but there are risks in the power
imbalance. Large firms may merely extract learnings at the startup's
expense, and founders may not know how to negotiate effectively or deal
with corporate politics, Tom describes. These principles are illustrated
via the case studies of a series of failed startups.

2. False starts

In a "false start," the startup rushes to launch the product without
adequate research and testing.

For example, the startup Triangulate launched by offering matching
algorithms to dating sites but had a couple of false starts by not
testing customer assumptions. Even after completing major pivots, it
never found a large enough market, and was beaten out by competitors.

D2C apparel startup Quincy ran into tough times when it switched to an
inventory-led model. The co-founders did not have industry experience
and were unable to bring the right talent on board; the investors could
not help much here either.

Tom suggests that the founders could probably have given new candidates
a "tryout" for skills and attitudinal fit before hiring them full-time.
Willingness to have tough conversations could have reduced co-founder
friction, and the business partner could have been given equity as well.

Tom cautions that sometimes engineers have too much of a bias for
action, and should instead launch products only after conducting tests
via mechanisms like landing pages (see my book review of The Startup
Owner's Manual by Steve Blank). Other errors can arise from their
introverted nature, or having too much arrogance without sufficient
industry experience.

Models like Double-Diamond Design are useful here, with problem and
solution tests via customer discovery interviews, focus groups,
positioning statements, and MVP testing.

Convenience sampling, overlooking interviews with decision-makers,
premature pitching, and relying only on early adopters ("category
enthusiasts") are other mistakes to avoid. Tom suggests corrective
measures like competitor mapping and using skilled facilitators in
customer discussions.

3. False positives

Pet care provider Baroo fell prey to the failure pattern of a false
positive - its initial encouraging test happened to be with residents in
a new neighbourhood. But later users from old neighbourhoods already had
pet care providers, and switching costs were high.

Premature scaling to other cities became unsustainable, and some
apartment concierge partners did not do adequate promotion. Without a
well-developed playbook, the startup eventually shut shop.

Tom cautions that unexpected early success can be very seductive. Risk
is heightened when founders believe their own hype, without adequate
market tests. Some founders may also be unaware of their own growth
goals.

II. Late-stage failures

Building on the opportunity-resource framework, Tom identifies four
scale opportunities - geography, product lines, breakthrough
innovations, and vertical integration.

1. Speed and scope

The '6 S' success factors in the scale stage are of two types: internal
(staff, structure, shared values) and external (speed, scope, series of
founding rounds). Scaling can also be achieved via acquisitions, though
there are cultural integration challenges as well.

Scale offers advantages (brand recognition, network effects, scale
economies) but also comes with challenges (saturation, competitors,
quality, morale, investor pressures).

The early team of jack-of-all-trades generalists needs to be
supplemented with specialists and managers. Such roles include product
managers, tech experts, HR heads, and a COO.

Formal organisational processes, structures and culture need to be built
up. But conflicts between the "old guard and new guard" can lead to
executive churn, Tom cautions (see my book review of What You Do Is Who
You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture by Ben Horowitz).

Founders "who don't want to grow up" should rely on guidance from
mentors and board members. Habits of working in isolation or preferring
only loyalists can be a challenge as well. Effective IT-based management
systems need to be added too.

2. The speed trap

In the "speed trap" failure pattern, demand from enthusiastic early
adopters ("the golden cohort") fuels explosive early growth that cannot
be profitably sustained in the mainstream market, Tom describes.

Competition can arise from fast followers, clones, or "sleeping dragons"
who eventually wake up. In some cases, growth pressure can lead to
unethical and even illegal behaviours by startups.

Tom outlines the RAWI framework to test scalability: ready, able,
willing and impelled. Without a proven business model, resources, and
willingness to grow, founders may fail.

Flash sales startup Fab.com was cloned by the "infamous Samwer brothers'
Rocket Internet incubator" in Europe. The startup burned cash to expand
from the US into Europe via local offices and acquisitions, and spent
prematurely on marketing.

Global players like Amazon also entered the fray, and Fab.com could not
compete effectively in the inventory game. It failed the RAWI test, and
later had to shut shop.

Tom suggests corrective measures at scale stage such as cohort analysis,
tracking NPS, enforcing patents, managing board debates, and learning
how to handle personal pressure during breakneck growth.

"Entrepreneurs must interpret trends correctly and act on them," Tom
emphasises. Otherwise, founders may end up digging a grave rather than a
gold mine.

2. Resource challenges

Human and financial resource challenges can also plague scale-stage
startups. First-time founders often do not have deep industry networks
or savviness in dealing with investors.

For example, Dot & Bo, an e-commerce startup in home furnishing, faced
severe supply chain strain while growing. Unreliable delivery times led
to an alarming gap between post-purchase and post-delivery NPS. Poor
tech infrastructure, bad hiring choices, and investor sentiment collapse
eventually led to shutdown.

"Deciding whether to raise a cash cushion can be tricky because it
forces an entrepreneur to choose between fear and greed," Tom cautions.

As some corrective measures, he advises checking on investors' current
funds, choosing the right specialists at the right time, and
strengthening company culture. "The challenge is finding the right
balance between bureaucracy and chaos," Tom observes.

3. Moonshots and miracles

Better Place founder Shai Agassi is an exemplar of a "monomaniacal
founder" who fell victim to the failure pattern of "cascading miracles,"
Tom explains.

The company bet simultaneously on strong demand for electric cars and
swappable batteries, effective manufacturer partnerships, international
markets, and effective execution. But it was plagued by rising costs,
poor quality, regulatory challenges, and wrong demand forecasts.

A founder's obsessive enthusiasm can lead to overconfidence about
customer interest and blindness to barriers, Tom cautions. Other
examples include Iridium, Segway and Theranos, though there have been
successful moonshots such as Federal Express and Tesla.

"A moonshot, once launched, has a lot of momentum and can be difficult
to steer in a new direction," Tom cautions. Challenges arise via sunken
costs and escalation of commitment to a flawed strategy.

Zeal and charisma can lead to a "reality distortion field" and move
mountains. But narcissists have an inflated sense of self-worth and need
for control and entitlement; they find it hard to reconsider strategy
and recalibrate.

Tom suggests corrective measures like executive coaches, independent
directors, and periodic founder/CEO assessments.

III. Closure and beyond

The concluding section of the book addresses what happens when the final
decision is made to shut down the company, and how entrepreneurs can
bounce back after failure.

1. The Last Lap

Typical last-ditch measures for a struggling startup include pivots,
bridge rounds from existing investors, bringing in new investors,
reducing headcount, or selling the company.

"Late pivots take longer to execute," Tom cautions. It also takes time
to complete due diligence for an acquisition and negotiate favourable
terms. "Typically, failure is a slow-motion affair," he adds.

Many founders desperately hope for an "eleventh-hour rescue," and
believe that entrepreneurs should not be quitters. At this troubled
stage of loneliness and misery, many founders also lack a sounding board
for good advice, Tom observes.

The founder's ego can take a big hit, along with a sense of loss of face
among employees for letting them down. There is worry about future
finances, and recovery of careers.

The final stages of winding down entail tax and vendor payments, paying
employee wages and benefits and helping them find other jobs, customer
communications, and carrying out bankruptcy proceedings. Experienced
lawyers and accountants will be needed at this stage.

After the last struggles and pulling the plug, the next phase of the
endgame is emotional catharsis followed by recovery.

2. Bouncing back

Elisabeth Kubler-Ross describes the five stages of grief as denial,
anger (who is to blame?), bargaining (what if? narratives), depression,
and acceptance.

Failure can unleash a host of emotions and reactions: guilt, shame,
regret, disappointment, embarrassment, confusion, and insecurity about
the future, Tom cautions.

At the same time, many founders have expressed no regret about starting
up despite eventual failure, and take pride in their experiences and
learnings. They would rather have been participants in the game of
change and opportunity than just observers.

As for coping measures, Tom advises therapy, journaling, physical
fitness routines, and hobbies. After recovery comes reflection on
lessons learnt about internal and external shortcomings, and testing the
story and post-mortem analysis with trusted circles.

"Just find one thing about your failure that reminds you that you are
still very good at something valuable," suggests Fab.com CEO Jason
Goldberg. He shared his personal failure story and lessons with friends,
family, colleagues, investors, and coach - and eventually bounced back
to start fitness instructor platform Moxie.

Steve Chambers (Jibo) became CMO at a green-tech startup, Christina
Wallace (Quincy Apparel) moved into consultancy and education,
co-founder Alexandra Nelson became venture effort leader at an MNC,
Sunil Nagaraj (Triangulate) became a venture capitalist, Lindsey Hyde
(Baroo) joined an educational foundation, Anthony Soohoo (Dot & Bo)
became EVP at an MNC, and Shai Agassi (Better Place) founded a startup
in public transportation.

The book ends with cautionary advice to aspiring founders to not blindly
follow the conventional wisdom of just do it (but don't truncate
research), be persistent (but be willing to pivot), be passionate (but
not overconfident), grow (but sustainably), focus (but also explore some
other options and segments), and be scrappy (but don't compromise on
skills, quality, ethics).

Analysis for decisions should be written up and shared, and emotional
discipline is called for. Tom advises entrepreneurs to think fast and
think slow, and assures that moonshots will still be needed to tackle
challenges like climate change.

"You're likely aware that while failure may be painful, the
entrepreneurial path is, for many people, an irresistible draw - a
career calling. You may well be one of them," Tom signs off.

In sum, this is a must-read book for all current and aspiring
entrepreneurs, as well as investors and entrepreneurship educators. It
offers a wealth of insights and tips into the world of startup
struggles, and the mix of storytelling with business principles makes
for an inspiring yet practical read.

Organic Acids Market Size to Reach $29,197 Billion by 2030 | CAGR: 8.3%

PORTLAND, OREGON, UNITED STATES, September 5, 2022 /EINPresswire.com /
-- Organic Acids Market Report, published by Allied Market Research,
projects that the global market was valued $16,837 million in 2016, and
is projected to reach $29,197 million by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 8.3%
from 2017 to 2023. The acetic acid segment held approximately one-third
of the total market share in 2016.

Access Full Summary at:

Organic acids are compounds that possess a carbon atom in its structure
and have a molecular formula RCOOH. Citric acid, acetic acid, lactic
acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, propionic acid, and
fumaric acid are some of the organic acids used widely in end-use
applications such as during formation of drugs, textiles, and adhesives.
These acids are produced commercially either by chemical synthesis or
from agro-industrial residues. However, fermentation processes are the
most commonly used methods. Furthermore, organic acids of tricarboxylic
acid cycle can be produced in high yields in microbiological processes.

Presently, the global organic acids market witnesses numerous
opportunities, owing to rapid increase in development of food & beverage
industry in Asia-Pacific and LAMEA. The decline in oil prices and
failure of start-up bio-fuel process have stimulated the production of
multiple organic acids from biomass as coproducts. This drives the
market growth as biomass acts as a renewable source for organic acids
production, thereby leveraging the cost of fuels for the production of
organic acids. Moreover, increase in demand for bio-based organic acids
has led to a surge in investment for R&D activities in the market.

Acetic acid accounted for almost two-third share, in terms of volume, in
2016, owing to increase in demand for acetic acids for preservation of
food items. In addition, acetic acids are being increasingly employed in
meat and poultry production in the form of sodium lactate to extend
shelf life, control pathogenic bacteria in food, improve water binding
capacity, and reduce sodium content.

Key Findings of the Organic Acids Market Study:

In terms of value, the succinic acid segment is anticipated to show the
highest growth rate of 29% during the analysis period.

Asia-Pacific is projected to maintain its lead throughout 2023, growing
at a CAGR of 7.1%, in terms of value.

Agro & industrial waste segment occupied approximately one-fifth of the
total market in 2016.

Germany occupied nearly one-fourth of the total Europe organic acids
market in 2016.

In terms of value, China is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2017
to 2023.

In 2016, Asia-Pacific accounted for nearly half of the total organic
acids market, and is expected to continue this trend, due to increase in
demand for organic acids in the manufacture of drugs and oil & gas
industries for corrosion resistance, specifically in China, India,
Japan, Brazil, and other developing countries.

The major companies profiled in the report include BASF SE, Cargill,
Inc., The Dow Chemical Company, Eastman Chemical Company, Myriant
Corporation, Calanese Corporation, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Henan
Jindan Lactic Acid Technology Co. Ltd., Tate & Lyle Plc., and E. I. Du
Pont De Nemours and Company.

India has a great opportunity to emerge as one of the major global
economic power fulfilling the aspiration of millions. India has close to
18% of world's population with the median age of 27.0 years.

India's Business is currently faced with a deficit of social skills
among its youth population. This can have serious implications on
business and national economy. According to a HBR-Ascend survey-'Skills
and Challenges faced by Millennials Today', when it comes to soft
skills, Indians fail miserably in the survey. Less than 5% of the youth
say they have the persuasion skills needed to be successful at the
workplace. Prime Minister Modi's has great hope from Indian youth, the
survey highlights the challenges in the path. Our teenagers and
millennials who are our future leaders, need help. This social skill
deficit is also endemic across our workforce as pointed by the Gallup
survey and impacting our Business.

We need to address the issue with a new Human Resource Development
paradigm to transform India's Human Capital across Business and Academic
institutions. Research in the field of behavioural science has time and
again pointed out that Sports not only creates a healthier population,
it also plays a vital role in building social and emotional skills. It
enables people to bond and build a collaborative environment. Sports
enable people to bond and work together. Social skills and Emotional
Intelligence help people in collaborating and leading, making it as one
of the most powerful leadership tool. Sports help people applying
thinking and analytical ability under stress. A sport is all about an
active body and calm mind essential for success in any field. It enables
people to bond and respect diversity - a critical component in building
the new India. A country that plays together grows together.

CEO's needs to encourage their team to take part in sports It can help
us learn a lot about Discipline, Consistency, Perseverance, Quality and
Innovation, Sports enables us to be better leaders, cope with failure
and be happy and healthy. A happy and healthy organization is more
productive.

Our youth in schools, colleges and universities must be encouraged to
take part in sports. Our current education system is too
bookish-knowledge oriented and stuck to the old school notion. We are
yet to realize and utilize the power of sports for developing our next
generation leaders. Sports can be a great leveller as it has the ability
to unite diverse people. Sports can play a vital role in National
Integration.

Israel and Singapore have been able to build great economy by building
people capability through a people development approach based on
developing both mind and body and addressing the issue of mediocrity
through building synergy of ability, attitude and passion. Talent alone
is not enough; we need to have attitude and passion among our youth. It
will help our start-up leaders look at failure as a teacher and part of
our growth journey instead of regarding it as irreversible. Sports can
help inculcate discipline and work ethics across Business and Academics.
Sports can help us transform the mind of our future leaders, enabling
the emergence of India as a world economic power. Sports, with little
resource, can make country's Human Resource more resourceful.

Just a large population of humans is of no value if it does not have
quality. Quality of our population is the key to growth.

To encourage entrepreneurial ecosystem in campus, Savitribai Phule Pune
University (SPPU) decided to launch an online PG Diploma in
Entrepreneurship in association with Entrepreneurship Development
Institute of India (EDII).Currently, the university is promoting
entrepreneurship in electric mobility, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
agriculture, water and health under Rashtriya Uchatar Shikshan Abhiyan
(RUSA)."In addition to strengthening the current entrepreneurship
ecosystem on the campus, the course will also help to create a pool of
job creators. Just producing graduates will lead to job seekers that
will not be beneficial for the development of the economy," says Nitin R
Karmalkar, vice chancellor, SPPU.The newly launched programme which is
open to all graduates, says Karmalkar is aimed to offer required
eco-system, guidance needed to nurture the budding entrepreneurs and
start-ups in India."In view of the economic slowdown due to the COVID-19
pandemic, entrepreneurship is vital for job creation and economic
growth. The time has come to promote the entrepreneurial talents and
offer them a roadmap to implement their ideas into reality," he adds.Why
startups fail Responding to question on failures of start-ups in India,
Karmalkar says that it is not because of the dearth of talent but
absence of mentoring and the regular analysis leads to collapse.Under
the newly launched programme, candidates will be taught about how to get
funding, patenting, marketing techniques etc. "To develop
entrepreneurial spirit in India, we need to bring a change in mindset.

Everything has its own hiccups and entrepreneurship is not prone to it.
It should start in a structured manner to minimise the failure," he
adds.How did the idea come Inspired by the IIT Madras incubation cell
which offers help to budding entrepreneurs, Karmalkar decided to start
the entrepreneurship education on the campus. "Several industries are
functional in and around Pune so hands-on training, internship and other
industry assistance will not be a problem for candidates enrolled with
the programme. The university will help students getting all kind of
support needed for them," he adds.Admission process and fee structure
The university is likely to start the admission process PG Diploma in
Entrepreneurship the by the end of this month. The fee structure is yet
to be decided. However, he assures that it would be reasonable. For

Accelerate your start-up game

India, Oct. 27 -- Startups can only achieve success and reach a unique
position when they move in the right direction. To provide them support
with a growth mindset, business/startups incubators are gaining huge
popularity across the globe. According to a US-based International
Business Association - there are around 7000 business incubators
worldwide.

Usually, early-stage startups have limited resources and expertise to
execute a billion-dollar business idea. That's where incubators play an
integral role to provide the direction and supportive framework to
innovate and take the business idea to the market.

From nurturing young entrepreneurs and their startups to providing
useful resources including office space, R&D Labs, hands-on management
training, marketing support and access to investors, business incubators
help founders in many ways to bootstrap a startup.

Idea validation

Every startup founder tries his/her best to come up with a revolutionary
business idea. They often consider the idea that can disrupt the market
and aim for becoming one of a kind in the industry. However, every
founder needs to be careful before launching and validating the idea.
They must follow an approach that can minimize risks and costs in
setting up the business with a maximized success rate.

A business incubator helps the founder in finding a problem that is
worth solving through a revolutionary concept or product. Additionally,
they focus on selling and the core market landscape to help founders
create a market fit product.

Mentorship

In order to build a sustainable and financially viable business, startup
entrepreneurs need mentoring. Incubators that mentor startups often
report a higher rate of success and attain a huge wealth of knowledge.
They are provided with the benefits of increased productivity,
problem-solving abilities and improved business performance.

A good business mentor having experience in building up a successful
business from the scratch is a great sounding board. With their
experience, founders can iron out several issues in finances, business
operations, expansion, product development and marketing.

Networking opportunities

Networking is the ability to find new customers, partners and investors
to grow the business. Business incubators can gear the business growth
for early-stage startups by fostering networks. Their potential to link
with people or lab space to provide valuable support and connections to
set up a sustainable business.

Furthermore, a business incubator identifies the most relevant practices
of networking that help startups acquire new business leads. In
addition, it focuses on updating the founders with new trends in
attracting influential people for their startup that play a crucial role
in making strong business connections.

Workspace & pool of shared resources

Unlike large enterprises or corporates, early-stage startups do not have
deep pockets. They face challenges in renting out an office space or
utilizing important resources. Entrepreneurs with the support of a
business incubator can get access to a decent workspace where they can
brainstorm and craft impactful business ideas.

Apart from office space, few business incubators also provide R&D and
lab support that help founders in the faster realization of their
business idea. Moreover, the founders get the opportunity to network
with like-minded innovators and take advantage of utilities and
cost-efficiency.

Support with fundraising strategies

Early-stage startups after developing a viable business idea require
funds. They are necessary for further expansion and scalability. Without
a business incubator, it becomes difficult for startup founders to reach
potential investors and pitch their idea. On the other hand, business
incubators have strong links with angel investors and venture
capitalists and can help the founders in crafting a winning pitch and
reaching out into investor meetings.

In a competitive market landscape like the present economy, the rate of
failure for early startups is high. Market estimates suggest - around
90% of Indian startups fail within the first five years of their
inception. Thus, support from business incubators can turn innovative
business ideas into reality and increase the startup success rate.

Space: the new frontier for investment trusts

The first UK-listed investment trust dedicated to space ventures hopes
support from retail investors will help fuel a smooth lift-off for the
company’s initial public offering next week. 

Seraphim Space Investment Trust aims to raise £180m to invest in
early-stage companies working to profit from the rush into space. Its
London listing offers retail investors access to companies that have
been difficult for them to invest in. 

“We wanted to make access to space affordable to the man on the street.
You don’t need to be a billionaire to invest in space,” said Mark
Boggett, Seraphim’s chief executive.

The launch comes amid growing interest in space companies from investors
as enterprises such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin
push forward the commercialisation of space. However, investment experts
caution that retail investors should not overload on space-related
vehicles. 

Boggett said the rapid decline in the cost of satellites will soon bring
a surge in the number of orbiters collecting data about the Earth. That
data can be used in businesses from predicting the weather to
facilitating insurance claims. 

“Space is not about rockets and satellites. It’s actually about a
digital play,” said Boggett. “The companies that we are investing in
don’t see themselves as space infrastructure companies. They see
themselves as data companies.”

Space is among the latest thematic investment opportunities to court
retail investors. Funds focused on niches such as renewable energy or
healthcare have drawn record inflows. 

Worldwide, venture capital investment in space companies jumped 95 per
cent to $8.7bn in the year to March, according to Seraphim, including
the combined $4.2bn raised by SpaceX and OneWeb. But access to invest in
these early-stage companies has largely been limited to private
investors in the past. Seraphim’s IPO will allow retail investors to get
a piece of the action, with a minimum investment of just £1,000. 

Scottish Mortgage fund manager Baillie Gifford, which favours investment
trusts as a way to offer retail investors access to private companies,
has also seen the attraction of space. Its small-cap trust, Edinburgh
Worldwide, took new stakes in two space companies in recent months. 

“Through our existing private investments in SpaceX and Spire we have
witnessed first-hand how the economics of accessing space and the
associated satellite and data opportunity are radically changing,”
Edinburgh Worldwide’s managers said. “The opportunity for new approaches
and capabilities in such a dynamic area is very real.”

But small space start-ups risk failure before they can become profitable
businesses. OneWeb, a satellite internet company, dealt a blow to
Britain’s space ambitions when it collapsed into bankruptcy last March,
before being rescued by the UK government and Indian billionaire Sunil
Bharti Mittal.

“The nature of the industry means the businesses [Seraphim] will invest
in are small cap companies with less mature businesses so the risk
profile will be higher than more established companies,” said Susannah
Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown,
which is facilitating retail access to the listing. 

Seraphim’s investment trust will take over the portfolio of its current
venture capital fund. The trust is aiming for net assets of £250m after
the IPO, including substantial fresh cash to deploy into new
investments. 

Kyle Caldwell, collectives editor at Interactive Investor, said the
space trust should be seen alongside other “innovative investment ideas”
within the alternatives asset class, such as music royalties. He said
these new ideas will face stiff competition for capital from more
traditional alternatives such as commodities, private equity and
infrastructure. Investment experts caution that alternatives should
typically only make up a small share of retail investors portfolios. 

The Seraphim Space launch will come during a busy year for new
investment trust IPOs, particularly in the alternatives category. Five
new trusts launched in the first half of 2021 — including four
infrastructure funds — raising a total of £1.2bn, the highest amount
since 2017, according to the Association of Investment Companies.

Has the appetite for plant-based meat already peaked?; Dramatic sales
growth at the start of the pandemic has faltered in the US and UK, but
the companies that invested an extra $3bn into the sector in 2021 are
gambling that meat alternatives are more than a fad.

Neil Rankin is an unlikely plant-based food entrepreneur. The
45-year-old Scot made his name spearheading London's barbecue restaurant
boom a decade ago, serving up steaks, ribs and whole carcasses cooked on
open fires.

After deciding that serving even sustainably reared meat would do little
to reverse the environmental impact of the industry, he pivoted to vegan
burgers and sausages, developing his product in his home kitchen. "I've
cooked millions of steaks over the past 10 years or so. I think I've
come to the end of [cooking meat] and plant-based is just so uncharted,"
he says.

Eschewing the use of protein processed from legumes such as soya or
peas, favoured by many makers of plant-based meat, his quest for a
sustainable alternative using vegetables led him to a vegan "meat" using
fermented onions, beets and mushrooms.

Rankin's company Symplicity Foods is now supplying premium burger chains
and restaurants in the UK, including Gordon Ramsay's Street Burger
outlets, Soho House, the private members club, and Indian eatery
Dishoom. After completing a £2m fundraising round it has just opened a
bigger production facility in north London.

Bean patties and tofu burgers have been around for decades, but consumer
interest in the new generation of plantbased meats, mimicking the taste,
texture and smell of animal meat, surged around the flotation of US
start-up Beyond Meat in 2019.

But the push by Rankin coincides with a faltering in sales growth in the
sector. After a 46 per cent rise in 2020 on the back of soaring demand
at the start of the pandemic, sales of plantbased meat in the US in 2021
fell 0.5 per cent, according to data provider SPINS. In the UK, Kantar
numbers show that sales tailed off in the second half of last year,
although in December they experienced a rebound.

"We have probably had a bit of a hype cycle, with an awful lot of people
trying things once or twice," says Will Hayllar, global managing partner
of OC&C Strategy Consultants. "That has driven very rapid growth."

The slowdown in growth has taken some executives by surprise. Many had
anticipated that the continuing anxiety over climate change and the
environmental cost of the meat industry ? which accounts for 15 per cent
of global carbon emissions ? would act as a major spur for plant-based
meat. Created with the help of biochemists and molecular scientists, it
offers a way of cutting meat intake without sacrificing something that
many consumers crave and love.

"This category has decelerated across the board," Michael McCain, chief
executive of Maple Leaf Foods, told analysts in November as he announced
a review of the Canadian group's plant-based meat business. Investors
have also been unnerved by Beyond Meat's performance and its relatively
subdued US revenue outlook, blamed on a range of issues from
Covid-related labour shortages to outages at its facilities. Its shares
now trade at about a quarter of its 2019 peak and the lossmaking group's
market capitalisation, once above $15bn, has slipped below $4bn.

Rankin believes the ebbing of the sales surge is down to products that
fail to meet taste expectations. "There are a lot of people that have
moved to plantbased because of sustainability issues, but yet they
aren't really satisfied with what's out there," he says. Price has also
been an issue as plant-based meat makers have struggled to get repeat
purchases from customers once the initial excitement has died down.

Primetime audition During the pandemic, plant-based meat had its "big
audition", which triggered the large jump in sales in 2020, says Arlin
Wasserman, founder of food strategy consultancy Changing Tastes. But
long term that seems to have actually worked against the category.

Buying in large quantities during the lockdowns highlighted "the
shortcomings of next-generation plant-based meats", Wasserman says. He
blames the long list of ingredients with unfamiliar names for making the
product look like highly processed food and acting as a barrier to
repeat purchases. "Consumers may buy it once, but after reading the
label, slow down their purchases."

In a Changing Tastes survey of 3,000 adults in the US in December, about
40 per cent said they did not eat plantbased meats or would not eat them
in the future despite 39 per cent saying they wanted to reduce their red
meat consumption. "It's an extremely high negative for such a new idea,"
says Wasserman.

Clues as to whether plant-based meat is just another fad might be found
in the "Gartner hype cycle" of emerging techgrowth nologies, say
agritech consultants and investment experts. Developed by the US
research and consultancy group, the curve illustrates what it says are
the five phases in the lifecycle of a new technology ? the initial surge
in expectations and then disappointment when it does not deliver,
leading to consolidation or company failures, improved product, and
finally mainstream adoption.

Many innovations, including mobile phones, artificial intelligence and
electric vehicles follow the cycle. Plantbased meat along with other
agri-technologies, such as insects for food and vertical farming, can be
plotted against the same curve, says Henry Gordon- Smith, founder of
consultancy Agritecture. For plant-based meat, "we are over the peak and
already into the 'trough of disillusionment'," says Gordon-Smith. He
characterises this as a period where start-up failures and industry
consolidation lead to improved efficiencies, stronger players and better
products, fuelling renewed growth.

The sustainability reasons for reducing consumption of meat ? the
production of which also contributes to land degradation and water
pollution ? remain compelling, with the global population predicted to
rise by another 2bn before 2050. Continuing investment is being made
into alternative proteins, with $3bn raised globally by plant-based
start-ups in 2021, up 74 per cent from a year earlier, according to data
group PitchBook.

Massimo Zucchero, head of plantbased meal solutions at Nestlé, the
world's largest food group, blames slower US sales growth on reduced
media interest and retailers rethinking their strategies. In Europe
there is high double-digit growth across most countries, he says. "Yes,
there has been a slowdown. [But] the market is going to start growing
again."

Nestlé estimates the value of the plant-based meat category to be around
$8bn in terms of sales, with potential of around 20 per cent per annum
across the next five years.

Hanneke Faber, president of Unilever's foods division, echoes Zucchero.
She too believes that the US phenomenon is temporary and predicts that
"going forward this market will continue to grow in the 20 per cent
range" every year.

Whether such projections are more than wishful thinking remains unclear.

It is easy to eat a plant-based burger at a restaurant, but breaking a
shopping habit and wondering if other family members will join in is
more difficult, says Hayllar. "Changing people's meal consumption
habits, changing the way they cook, that tends to be a slower thing to
happen."

The fight for the 'centre of the plate' For large food companies,
plant-based proteins have widened the opportunity to compete for what
they call the "centre of the plate" in western markets, which have for
decades been dominated by meat processors and farmers. Now,
multinationals are racing to build a business in plant-based protein
alternatives, as well as investing for the future in lab-grown meat.

At a tasting event on a floating hotel in London last year, Nestle's
chief executive Mark Schneider predicted that every animal protein would
over time have a plant-based alternative as he introduced the company's
latest faux shrimp and egg products, as well as plant-based sausages,
mince and chicken. Fake ham and smoked salmon are also under
development.

Hayllar says plant-based protein appeals to consumer goods makers such
as Nestlé and Unilever because it is branded, not commodified, enabling
them to tap into their marketing strengths and create price
differentiation between premium and everyday versions of the product.
"One of the interesting things about the [worldwide] shift to
plant-based is that it's been a brand-led move, whereas in a market like
the UK the meat is almost all private label [or unbranded] ... one of
the appeals for businesses ... is that they can market [these products]
to shift consumer behaviour," he adds.

Investing in alternative proteins, including plant-based meats, also
offers companies the opportunity to burnish their environmental
credentials for investors. "It's one thing they can add to their annual
report helping reputational gains. Some see it as a social cost to
operate," says JP Frossard, consumer foods analyst at Rabobank in New
York.

Investor advisory and research network Fairr ? Farm Animal Investment
Risk and Return ? backed by institutional investors managing about
$47tn, has called on food and meat companies as well as restaurants and
retailers to increase their alternative protein offerings to enhance
returns and mitigate future supply risk.

Continuous spending on research and development into areas from taste
and texture to health and nutrition is needed to make meaningful inroads
into plant-based foods and maintain consumer interest, say executives.
Unilever, for example, spent (EURO)85m on a food innovation research
centre at the Wageningen University campus in the Netherlands, with a
focus on plantbased ingredients and meat alternatives and other products
such as ice cream and mayonnaise, according to Faber.

Frossard says: "You're not going to survive unless you continue research
for a better product ? focus needs to be on affordability and taste."

At a tasting event at a restaurant in London's Leicester Square, more
than 100 of the city's chefs last November marked the arrival of the
latest innovation from Israeli start-up Redefine Meat. The company
became the first to commercially launch a "structured" plant-based meat,
and the chefs tucked into "beef cut au poivre" and "lamb cut la
Dijonnaise" made from meat produced via a 3D printer.

For the large part, faux meat products have been those made from
ingredients pushed through an extruder to resemble mince. Apart from
cracking the "holy grail" of cuts of meat, Redefine cofounder Eshchar
Ben-Shitrit believes the start-up has worked out how to reproduce the
juiciness of real meat.

The next big thing in alternative proteins will be the eventual
commercial launch of meats made from cow, pig and chicken cells grown in
vats. Although not vegetarian, they are expected to generate lower
emissions than live animals. Having gained the world's first regulatory
approval in Singapore in 2020, entrepreneurs behind lab-grown meat are
hoping that US food authorities will give it the nod this year.

Despite the dystopian images of scientists creating meat in
laboratories, many consumers in the west seem oblivious to the rise of
technology in food, say analysts. R&D has long been a feature in the
industry, with tastes, smells and textures carefully analysed. "I don't
think many consumers will be put off by the food being invented in a
laboratory, with some exceptions," says Wasserman. "So it's more about
how it is produced after it's invented."

Seaweed and fermented tomatoes Executives and analysts believe that the
opportunities are too big for plantbased meat to be a flash in the pan.
Indeed, the Good Food Institute, a lobbying and consultancy group for
alternative proteins, believes that the industry will need five to 10
times more production capacity by 2030 to satisfy demand.

Nestlé sees various opportunities in the category, including emerging
markets, especially in Asia where vegan protein-rich products such as
tofu have been around for centuries.

Another area is a whole different plant-based segment that does not try
to mimic meat. This is about "putting vegetables at the heart of, the
centre of the plate, in a delicious way," says Zucchero. His colleague
Wayne England, head of food strategy at Nestlé, says demand for meat
will need to be satisfied by alternative sources because current levels
of consumption are not sustainable. "There is so much more to come to
the category," he says, "the world cannot feed itself with so much
meat."

It is not just the multinationals pushing R&D efforts. On the other end
of the spectrum, Rankin says he is busy with development of his own. He
is working on a healthy fat using seaweed and fermented tomatoes and is
also looking at the byproducts from his manufacturing process, including
the liquid that comes off the fermentation of vegetables which might be
turned into products such as gravy. Turning leftover sourdough bread
into miso instead of importing the soyabean-based condiment from Japan
is another project.

"There's so much that I don't think I'm going to get it done in the next
year, so I think I'm going to be at this for a fair while," he says.
Consumers will return to plant-based meats once the products evolve,
says Rankin. "The interest [in plant-based meat] isn't waning," he adds.
"I [just] think the product has not quite caught up with the interest
yet."

N eil Rankin is an unlikely plant-based food entrepreneur. The
45-year-old Scot made his name spearheading London's barbecue restaurant
boom a decade ago, serving up steaks, ribs and whole carcasses cooked on
open fires.

After deciding that serving even sustainably reared meat would do little
to reverse the environmental impact of the industry, he pivoted to vegan
burgers and sausages, developing his product in his home kitchen. "I've
cooked millions of steaks over the past 10 years or so. I think I've
come to the end of [cooking meat] and plant-based is just so uncharted,"
he says.

Eschewing the use of protein processed from legumes such as soya or
peas, favoured by many makers of plant-based meat, his quest for a
sustainable alternative using vegetables led him to a vegan "meat" using
fermented onions, beets and mushrooms.

Rankin's company Symplicity Foods is now supplying premium burger chains
and restaurants in the UK, including Gordon Ramsay's Street Burger
outlets, Soho House, the private members club, and Indian eatery
Dishoom. After completing a £2m fundraising round it has just opened a
bigger production facility in north London.

Bean patties and tofu burgers have been around for decades, but consumer
interest in the new generation of plantbased meats, mimicking the taste,
texture and smell of animal meat, surged around the flotation of US
start-up Beyond Meat in 2019.

But the push by Rankin coincides with a faltering in sales growth in the
sector. After a 46 per cent rise in 2020 on the back of soaring demand
at the start of the pandemic, sales of plantbased meat in the US in 2021
fell 0.5 per cent, according to data provider SPINS. In the UK, Kantar
numbers show that sales tailed off in the second half of last year,
although in December they experienced a rebound.

"We have probably had a bit of a hype cycle, with an awful lot of people
trying things once or twice," says Will Hayllar, global managing partner
of OC&C Strategy Consultants. "That has driven very rapid growth."

The slowdown in growth has taken some executives by surprise. Many had
anticipated that the continuing anxiety over climate change and the
environmental cost of the meat industry - which accounts for 15 per cent
of global carbon emissions - would act as a major spur for plant-based
meat. Created with the help of biochemists and molecular scientists, it
offers a way of cutting meat intake without sacrificing something that
many consumers crave and love.

"This category has decelerated across the board," Michael McCain, chief
executive of Maple Leaf Foods, told analysts in November as he announced
a review of the Canadian group's plant-based meat business. Investors
have also been unnerved by Beyond Meat's performance and its relatively
subdued US revenue outlook, blamed on a range of issues from
Covid-related labour shortages to outages at its facilities. Its shares
now trade at about a quarter of its 2019 peak and the lossmaking group's
market capitalisation, once above $15bn, has slipped below $4bn.

Rankin believes the ebbing of the sales surge is down to products that
fail to meet taste expectations. "There are a lot of people that have
moved to plantbased because of sustainability issues, but yet they
aren't really satisfied with what's out there," he says. Price has also
been an issue as plant-based meat makers have struggled to get repeat
purchases from customers once the initial excitement has died down.

Primetime audition During the pandemic, plant-based meat had its "big
audition", which triggered the large jump in sales in 2020, says Arlin
Wasserman, founder of food strategy consultancy Changing Tastes. But
long term that seems to have actually worked against the category.

Buying in large quantities during the lockdowns highlighted "the
shortcomings of next-generation plant-based meats", Wasserman says. He
blames the long list of ingredients with unfamiliar names for making the
product look like highly processed food and acting as a barrier to
repeat purchases. "Consumers may buy it once, but after reading the
label, slow down their purchases."

In a Changing Tastes survey of 3,000 adults in the US in December, about
40 per cent said they did not eat plantbased meats or would not eat them
in the future despite 39 per cent saying they wanted to reduce their red
meat consumption. "It's an extremely high negative for such a new idea,"
says Wasserman.

Clues as to whether plant-based meat is just another fad might be found
in the "Gartner hype cycle" of emerging techgrowth nologies, say
agritech consultants and investment experts. Developed by the US
research and consultancy group, the curve illustrates what it says are
the five phases in the lifecycle of a new technology - the initial surge
in expectations and then disappointment when it does not deliver,
leading to consolidation or company failures, improved product, and
finally mainstream adoption.

Many innovations, including mobile phones, artificial intelligence and
electric vehicles follow the cycle. Plantbased meat along with other
agri-technologies, such as insects for food and vertical farming, can be
plotted against the same curve, says Henry Gordon- Smith, founder of
consultancy Agritecture. For plant-based meat, "we are over the peak and
already into the 'trough of disillusionment'," says Gordon-Smith. He
characterises this as a period where start-up failures and industry
consolidation lead to improved efficiencies, stronger players and better
products, fuelling renewed growth.

The sustainability reasons for reducing consumption of meat - the
production of which also contributes to land degradation and water
pollution - remain compelling, with the global population predicted to
rise by another 2bn before 2050. Continuing investment is being made
into alternative proteins, with $3bn raised globally by plant-based
start-ups in 2021, up 74 per cent from a year earlier, according to data
group PitchBook.

Massimo Zucchero, head of plantbased meal solutions at Nestlé, the
world's largest food group, blames slower US sales growth on reduced
media interest and retailers rethinking their strategies. In Europe
there is high double-digit growth across most countries, he says. "Yes,
there has been a slowdown. [But] the market is going to start growing
again."

Nestlé estimates the value of the plant-based meat category to be around
$8bn in terms of sales, with potential of around 20 per cent per annum
across the next five years.

Hanneke Faber, president of Unilever's foods division, echoes Zucchero.
She too believes that the US phenomenon is temporary and predicts that
"going forward this market will continue to grow in the 20 per cent
range" every year.

Whether such projections are more than wishful thinking remains unclear.

It is easy to eat a plant-based burger at a restaurant, but breaking a
shopping habit and wondering if other family members will join in is
more difficult, says Hayllar. "Changing people's meal consumption
habits, changing the way they cook, that tends to be a slower thing to
happen."

The fight for the 'centre of the plate' For large food companies,
plant-based proteins have widened the opportunity to compete for what
they call the "centre of the plate" in western markets, which have for
decades been dominated by meat processors and farmers. Now,
multinationals are racing to build a business in plant-based protein
alternatives, as well as investing for the future in lab-grown meat.

At a tasting event on a floating hotel in London last year, Nestle's
chief executive Mark Schneider predicted that every animal protein would
over time have a plant-based alternative as he introduced the company's
latest faux shrimp and egg products, as well as plant-based sausages,
mince and chicken. Fake ham and smoked salmon are also under
development.

Hayllar says plant-based protein appeals to consumer goods makers such
as Nestlé and Unilever because it is branded, not commodified, enabling
them to tap into their marketing strengths and create price
differentiation between premium and everyday versions of the product.
"One of the interesting things about the [worldwide] shift to
plant-based is that it's been a brand-led move, whereas in a market like
the UK the meat is almost all private label [or unbranded] ... one of
the appeals for businesses ... is that they can market [these products]
to shift consumer behaviour," he adds.

Investing in alternative proteins, including plant-based meats, also
offers companies the opportunity to burnish their environmental
credentials for investors. "It's one thing they can add to their annual
report helping reputational gains. Some see it as a social cost to
operate," says JP Frossard, consumer foods analyst at Rabobank in New
York.

Investor advisory and research network Fairr - Farm Animal Investment
Risk and Return - backed by institutional investors managing about
$47tn, has called on food and meat companies as well as restaurants and
retailers to increase their alternative protein offerings to enhance
returns and mitigate future supply risk.

Continuous spending on research and development into areas from taste
and texture to health and nutrition is needed to make meaningful inroads
into plant-based foods and maintain consumer interest, say executives.
Unilever, for example, spent (EURO)85m on a food innovation research
centre at the Wageningen University campus in the Netherlands, with a
focus on plantbased ingredients and meat alternatives and other products
such as ice cream and mayonnaise, according to Faber.

Frossard says: "You're not going to survive unless you continue research
for a better product - focus needs to be on affordability and taste."

At a tasting event at a restaurant in London's Leicester Square, more
than 100 of the city's chefs last November marked the arrival of the
latest innovation from Israeli start-up Redefine Meat. The company
became the first to commercially launch a "structured" plant-based meat,
and the chefs tucked into "beef cut au poivre" and "lamb cut la
Dijonnaise" made from meat produced via a 3D printer.

For the large part, faux meat products have been those made from
ingredients pushed through an extruder to resemble mince. Apart from
cracking the "holy grail" of cuts of meat, Redefine cofounder Eshchar
Ben-Shitrit believes the start-up has worked out how to reproduce the
juiciness of real meat.

The next big thing in alternative proteins will be the eventual
commercial launch of meats made from cow, pig and chicken cells grown in
vats. Although not vegetarian, they are expected to generate lower
emissions than live animals. Having gained the world's first regulatory
approval in Singapore in 2020, entrepreneurs behind lab-grown meat are
hoping that US food authorities will give it the nod this year.

Despite the dystopian images of scientists creating meat in
laboratories, many consumers in the west seem oblivious to the rise of
technology in food, say analysts. R&D has long been a feature in the
industry, with tastes, smells and textures carefully analysed. "I don't
think many consumers will be put off by the food being invented in a
laboratory, with some exceptions," says Wasserman. "So it's more about
how it is produced after it's invented."

Seaweed and fermented tomatoes Executives and analysts believe that the
opportunities are too big for plantbased meat to be a flash in the pan.
Indeed, the Good Food Institute, a lobbying and consultancy group for
alternative proteins, believes that the industry will need five to 10
times more production capacity by 2030 to satisfy demand.

Nestlé sees various opportunities in the category, including emerging
markets, especially in Asia where vegan protein-rich products such as
tofu have been around for centuries.

Another area is a whole different plant-based segment that does not try
to mimic meat. This is about "putting vegetables at the heart of, the
centre of the plate, in a delicious way," says Zucchero. His colleague
Wayne England, head of food strategy at Nestlé, says demand for meat
will need to be satisfied by alternative sources because current levels
of consumption are not sustainable. "There is so much more to come to
the category," he says, "the world cannot feed itself with so much
meat."

It is not just the multinationals pushing R&D efforts. On the other end
of the spectrum, Rankin says he is busy with development of his own. He
is working on a healthy fat using seaweed and fermented tomatoes and is
also looking at the byproducts from his manufacturing process, including
the liquid that comes off the fermentation of vegetables which might be
turned into products such as gravy. Turning leftover sourdough bread
into miso instead of importing the soyabean-based condiment from Japan
is another project.

"There's so much that I don't think I'm going to get it done in the next
year, so I think I'm going to be at this for a fair while," he says.
Consumers will return to plant-based meats once the products evolve,
says Rankin. "The interest [in plant-based meat] isn't waning," he adds.
"I [just] think the product has not quite caught up with the interest
yet."

Has the appetite for plant-based meat already peaked?; Dramatic sales
growth at the start of the pandemic has faltered in the US and UK, but

What's the least glamorous 'P' of product marketing?

The least glamorous, and the most challenging 'P' of product marketing
is Distribution! It still gets labelled as a "Leaky Bucket" in most
business reviews

Product distribution requires physical efforts and effective
distribution is the only tactic which helps you win the moment of truth.
The biggest dissonance a brand can face is non-availability within arm's
reach of its target group / consumer (TG / TC). Every other dissonance
is secondary and / or subsequent to this dissonance.

This is also the same aspect that differentiates product marketing from
service marketing - at its most basic level. The advent of technology
has benefited service distribution the most. However, it has not yet
fully solved the hardships of physical product distribution. Owing to
this, we have seen multiple start-ups which have achieved Unicorn
status, have largely been offering Services. There are very few in the
product marketing start-up space and even fewer or zilch that have
achieved Unicorn status. Of course, I am not labelling any of these
start-ups as failures. In fact, many of them are successful and have a
profitable business model (already!) - unlike their services
counterparts who are busy inflating just three KPIs - valuations, GMVs
and losses!

Specifically, in the Indian context, the dominant mix of general trade
channel to most product categories has been an aspect that makes things
extremely challenging (for organisations) on multiple fronts

1. Upfront investments and expenses to establish pan-India footprint.

- This gets further complicated when organisations also aspire to
establish omni-channel presence

2. Reasonably high and recurring fixed costs.

3. Manpower intensive.

4. Dependency on third party partnerships (CFAs, distributors, etc.) for
last-mile execution.

5. Average square feet space available per retail outlet - this is too
low, already over-flowing and expands at a snail's pace. Thus, product /
category / brand / line expansions and / or extensions are challenging
to Launch Establish Sustain Generate absolute and / or desired
incremental top-line.

- Cannibalisation effect seeps in (not with consumer, but with
shelf-space, retailer / distributor stocking, etc.), within no time of
launch.

6. Low RPO - Revenue Per Outlet (drop-size) - Average top-line per
retail delivery is very low for India (amongst comparable size of
economies).

7. Lack of scan data (consumer off-take) from a dominant channel
(general trade).

8. Market research data collection is complex and challenging and is
based on a certain sample size.

a. This makes it prone to error owing to human interference, design bias
and / or inadequate representation.

b. Sample sets are changed at a pre-defined frequency. Thus, macro
change might take time to seep into the data.

c. However, this is one area where technology has also evolved -
especially for capturing data, for quicker analysis, throwing up
anomalies (faster than ever) and for overall decision making.

d. The time has come for this piece to be automated to the next level -
that is, retail outlets, who are part of the sample, have simple
technological solutions that capture data on a daily basis (rather than
once a month visits from the data collector).

9. Revenue Management / Pack-Price Play (by sales channels) are not a
fully evolved science. That is, they are not "way of life" for most
organisations.

a. Largely, same set of SKU(s) are launched across all the channels.

b. Over a period of time, consumer off-take decides the dominant channel
for that set of SKU(s).

c. However, recently, we are seeing increasing trend towards
channel-specific launches.

i. This is happening more in the premium space where modern retail and
e-comm channels act as rightful vent. The reason is that these channels
provide ease of product placement (fewer number of customers for deal
making, fewer locations for physical delivery) and quick data collation
towards actual off-takes.

ii. This also solves the P&L pressures that many brands / marketers
might be facing from their regular business (provided the planned
volumes are achieved).

10. "Rural" - the buzzword that everyone wants to crack. However, this
requires clear answers to a few pertinent questions

a. Which set of current and future SKUs are relevant for rural markets?

b. What is the distribution set-up / design for catering to rural
markets? Is it physical (direct) or through activating wholesale
(indirect) or both?

c. How will the organisation maintain sanctity of pricing (across its
entire offering for rural) so that there is no channel conflict?

d. What capability interventions are being planned for sales teams -
internal team as well as external team?

e. Is the organisation going to have a dedicated rural sales vertical?
If yes, what is the minimum horizon for which the organisation is
committing the added costs for this structure?

f. What are the POS solutions designed for deployment in rural markets?

g. What BTL activations are designed specifically for the rural markets?
In fact, what is the BTL calendar for the rural markets?

h. At each level in the organisation, what are the KPIs to be tracked
and reviewed? How will the performance scorecard reflect the "Rural"
delivery?

Unlike any media vehicle, distribution can't be bought (especially, the
one we expect to stick around for a while). It must be built -
painstakingly, day in and day out - with perseverance, rigour,
passionate reviews and dispassionate feedback / course correction. Any
and every spend on the brand is futile, if distribution is not in place.

Has the appetite for plant-based meat already peaked?; Dramatic sales
growth at the start of the pandemic has faltered in the US and UK, but
the companies that invested an extra $3bn into the sector in 2021 are
gambling that meat alternatives are more than a fad.

N eil Rankin is an unlikely plant-based food entrepreneur. The
45-year-old Scot made his name spearheading London's barbecue restaurant
boom a decade ago, serving up steaks, ribs and whole carcasses cooked on
open fires.

After deciding that serving even sustainably reared meat would do little
to reverse the environmental impact of the industry, he pivoted to vegan
burgers and sausages, developing his product in his home kitchen. "I've
cooked millions of steaks over the past 10 years or so. I think I've
come to the end of [cooking meat] and plant-based is just so uncharted,"
he says.

Eschewing the use of protein processed from legumes such as soya or
peas, favoured by many makers of plant-based meat, his quest for a
sustainable alternative using vegetables led him to a vegan "meat" using
fermented onions, beets and mushrooms.

Rankin's company Symplicity Foods is now supplying premium burger chains
and restaurants in the UK, including Gordon Ramsay's Street Burger
outlets, Soho House, the private members club, and Indian eatery
Dishoom. After completing a £2m fundraising round it has just opened a
bigger production facility in north London.

Bean patties and tofu burgers have been around for decades, but consumer
interest in the new generation of plantbased meats, mimicking the taste,
texture and smell of animal meat, surged around the flotation of US
start-up Beyond Meat in 2019.

But the push by Rankin coincides with a faltering in sales growth in the
sector. After a 46 per cent rise in 2020 on the back of soaring demand
at the start of the pandemic, sales of plantbased meat in the US in 2021
fell 0.5 per cent, according to data provider SPINS. In the UK, Kantar
numbers show that sales tailed off in the second half of last year,
although in December they experienced a rebound.

"We have probably had a bit of a hype cycle, with an awful lot of people
trying things once or twice," says Will Hayllar, global managing partner
of OC&C Strategy Consultants. "That has driven very rapid growth."

The slowdown in growth has taken some executives by surprise. Many had
anticipated that the continuing anxiety over climate change and the
environmental cost of the meat industry - which accounts for 15 per cent
of global carbon emissions - would act as a major spur for plant-based
meat. Created with the help of biochemists and molecular scientists, it
offers a way of cutting meat intake without sacrificing something that
many consumers crave and love.

"This category has decelerated across the board," Michael McCain, chief
executive of Maple Leaf Foods, told analysts in November as he announced
a review of the Canadian group's plant-based meat business. Investors
have also been unnerved by Beyond Meat's performance and its relatively
subdued US revenue outlook, blamed on a range of issues from
Covid-related labour shortages to outages at its facilities. Its shares
now trade at about a quarter of its 2019 peak and the lossmaking group's
market capitalisation, once above $15bn, has slipped below $4bn.

Rankin believes the ebbing of the sales surge is down to products that
fail to meet taste expectations. "There are a lot of people that have
moved to plantbased because of sustainability issues, but yet they
aren't really satisfied with what's out there," he says. Price has also
been an issue as plant-based meat makers have struggled to get repeat
purchases from customers once the initial excitement has died down.

Primetime audition During the pandemic, plant-based meat had its "big
audition", which triggered the large jump in sales in 2020, says Arlin
Wasserman, founder of food strategy consultancy Changing Tastes. But
long term that seems to have actually worked against the category.

Buying in large quantities during the lockdowns highlighted "the
shortcomings of next-generation plant-based meats", Wasserman says. He
blames the long list of ingredients with unfamiliar names for making the
product look like highly processed food and acting as a barrier to
repeat purchases. "Consumers may buy it once, but after reading the
label, slow down their purchases."

In a Changing Tastes survey of 3,000 adults in the US in December, about
40 per cent said they did not eat plantbased meats or would not eat them
in the future despite 39 per cent saying they wanted to reduce their red
meat consumption. "It's an extremely high negative for such a new idea,"
says Wasserman.

Clues as to whether plant-based meat is just another fad might be found
in the "Gartner hype cycle" of emerging techgrowth nologies, say
agritech consultants and investment experts. Developed by the US
research and consultancy group, the curve illustrates what it says are
the five phases in the lifecycle of a new technology - the initial surge
in expectations and then disappointment when it does not deliver,
leading to consolidation or company failures, improved product, and
finally mainstream adoption.

Many innovations, including mobile phones, artificial intelligence and
electric vehicles follow the cycle. Plantbased meat along with other
agri-technologies, such as insects for food and vertical farming, can be
plotted against the same curve, says Henry Gordon- Smith, founder of
consultancy Agritecture. For plant-based meat, "we are over the peak and
already into the 'trough of disillusionment'," says Gordon-Smith. He
characterises this as a period where start-up failures and industry
consolidation lead to improved efficiencies, stronger players and better
products, fuelling renewed growth.

The sustainability reasons for reducing consumption of meat - the
production of which also contributes to land degradation and water
pollution - remain compelling, with the global population predicted to
rise by another 2bn before 2050. Continuing investment is being made
into alternative proteins, with $3bn raised globally by plant-based
start-ups in 2021, up 74 per cent from a year earlier, according to data
group PitchBook.

Massimo Zucchero, head of plantbased meal solutions at Nestlé, the
world's largest food group, blames slower US sales growth on reduced
media interest and retailers rethinking their strategies. In Europe
there is high double-digit growth across most countries, he says. "Yes,
there has been a slowdown. [But] the market is going to start growing
again."

Nestlé estimates the value of the plant-based meat category to be around
$8bn in terms of sales, with potential of around 20 per cent per annum
across the next five years.

Hanneke Faber, president of Unilever's foods division, echoes Zucchero.
She too believes that the US phenomenon is temporary and predicts that
"going forward this market will continue to grow in the 20 per cent
range" every year.

Whether such projections are more than wishful thinking remains unclear.

It is easy to eat a plant-based burger at a restaurant, but breaking a
shopping habit and wondering if other family members will join in is
more difficult, says Hayllar. "Changing people's meal consumption
habits, changing the way they cook, that tends to be a slower thing to
happen."

The fight for the 'centre of the plate' For large food companies,
plant-based proteins have widened the opportunity to compete for what
they call the "centre of the plate" in western markets, which have for
decades been dominated by meat processors and farmers. Now,
multinationals are racing to build a business in plant-based protein
alternatives, as well as investing for the future in lab-grown meat.

At a tasting event on a floating hotel in London last year, Nestle's
chief executive Mark Schneider predicted that every animal protein would
over time have a plant-based alternative as he introduced the company's
latest faux shrimp and egg products, as well as plant-based sausages,
mince and chicken. Fake ham and smoked salmon are also under
development.

Hayllar says plant-based protein appeals to consumer goods makers such
as Nestlé and Unilever because it is branded, not commodified, enabling
them to tap into their marketing strengths and create price
differentiation between premium and everyday versions of the product.
"One of the interesting things about the [worldwide] shift to
plant-based is that it's been a brand-led move, whereas in a market like
the UK the meat is almost all private label [or unbranded] ... one of
the appeals for businesses ... is that they can market [these products]
to shift consumer behaviour," he adds.

Investing in alternative proteins, including plant-based meats, also
offers companies the opportunity to burnish their environmental
credentials for investors. "It's one thing they can add to their annual
report helping reputational gains. Some see it as a social cost to
operate," says JP Frossard, consumer foods analyst at Rabobank in New
York.

Investor advisory and research network Fairr - Farm Animal Investment
Risk and Return - backed by institutional investors managing about
$47tn, has called on food and meat companies as well as restaurants and
retailers to increase their alternative protein offerings to enhance
returns and mitigate future supply risk.

Continuous spending on research and development into areas from taste
and texture to health and nutrition is needed to make meaningful inroads
into plant-based foods and maintain consumer interest, say executives.
Unilever, for example, spent (EURO)85m on a food innovation research
centre at the Wageningen University campus in the Netherlands, with a
focus on plantbased ingredients and meat alternatives and other products
such as ice cream and mayonnaise, according to Faber.

Frossard says: "You're not going to survive unless you continue research
for a better product - focus needs to be on affordability and taste."

At a tasting event at a restaurant in London's Leicester Square, more
than 100 of the city's chefs last November marked the arrival of the
latest innovation from Israeli start-up Redefine Meat. The company
became the first to commercially launch a "structured" plant-based meat,
and the chefs tucked into "beef cut au poivre" and "lamb cut la
Dijonnaise" made from meat produced via a 3D printer.

For the large part, faux meat products have been those made from
ingredients pushed through an extruder to resemble mince. Apart from
cracking the "holy grail" of cuts of meat, Redefine cofounder Eshchar
Ben-Shitrit believes the start-up has worked out how to reproduce the
juiciness of real meat.

The next big thing in alternative proteins will be the eventual
commercial launch of meats made from cow, pig and chicken cells grown in
vats. Although not vegetarian, they are expected to generate lower
emissions than live animals. Having gained the world's first regulatory
approval in Singapore in 2020, entrepreneurs behind lab-grown meat are
hoping that US food authorities will give it the nod this year.

Despite the dystopian images of scientists creating meat in
laboratories, many consumers in the west seem oblivious to the rise of
technology in food, say analysts. R&D has long been a feature in the
industry, with tastes, smells and textures carefully analysed. "I don't
think many consumers will be put off by the food being invented in a
laboratory, with some exceptions," says Wasserman. "So it's more about
how it is produced after it's invented."

Seaweed and fermented tomatoes Executives and analysts believe that the
opportunities are too big for plantbased meat to be a flash in the pan.
Indeed, the Good Food Institute, a lobbying and consultancy group for
alternative proteins, believes that the industry will need five to 10
times more production capacity by 2030 to satisfy demand.

Nestlé sees various opportunities in the category, including emerging
markets, especially in Asia where vegan protein-rich products such as
tofu have been around for centuries.

Another area is a whole different plant-based segment that does not try
to mimic meat. This is about "putting vegetables at the heart of, the
centre of the plate, in a delicious way," says Zucchero. His colleague
Wayne England, head of food strategy at Nestlé, says demand for meat
will need to be satisfied by alternative sources because current levels
of consumption are not sustainable. "There is so much more to come to
the category," he says, "the world cannot feed itself with so much
meat."

It is not just the multinationals pushing R&D efforts. On the other end
of the spectrum, Rankin says he is busy with development of his own. He
is working on a healthy fat using seaweed and fermented tomatoes and is
also looking at the byproducts from his manufacturing process, including
the liquid that comes off the fermentation of vegetables which might be
turned into products such as gravy. Turning leftover sourdough bread
into miso instead of importing the soyabean-based condiment from Japan
is another project.

"There's so much that I don't think I'm going to get it done in the next
year, so I think I'm going to be at this for a fair while," he says.
Consumers will return to plant-based meats once the products evolve,
says Rankin. "The interest [in plant-based meat] isn't waning," he adds.
"I [just] think the product has not quite caught up with the interest
yet."

Currently, there has been a mad rush to establish new startups in India.
There are more than 6.2 crore registered enterprises in the country. Out
of which, more than 90 per cent do not survive for more than 3 years and
97 per cent do not exist after a decade. One of the major reasons for
startup failure is that they do not provide solutions to unresolved
problems in society.

"Start-ups providing solution to problems in society tend to create
business opportunities. Apart from this, it ensures sustenance in
business operations. This aspect is greatly missing in many enterprises
and eventually, they land up creating competition at a market place. As
a rule in business, one who is new and weak financially dies first,"
said Aslam Charania, CEO of M/s Change India, Ahmedabad while speaking
on the topic 'Entrepreneurship: Charms and Challenges' recently. He was
the guest speaker at an event organised by Indian Institute of
Foundrymen (IIF) Nagpur Chapter in association with Laxmi Narayan
Institute of Technology (LIT) at LIT auditorium.

Charania said, "The objective of starting a new enterprise should be
providing solutions to problems faced by society. The motive should not
be to make quick money. The real creativity comes into the picture by
focusing on unsolved issues. Such business models last longer."

Charania explained to students that there exists a huge potential if
they start something which will be beneficial to the community. It will
provide an opportunity to get established in the market. To make his
point, he provided data on various elements covering country wise age,
GDP of various countries and a list of unresolved problems in society.
"The data could be used by students to understand the quantum of
opportunities that exist in India," he added.

The chief guest of the programme was Prof Dr Bhotmange, LIT Nagpur.
While the guest of honour was Prof Dr Ugwekar, LIT Nagpur. Also present
were Anuja Sharma, Treasurer of IIF Western Region, Sushil Sharma, Past
Chairman of IIF Western Region who is an alumnus of LIT, Saurabh Mehta,
Vice Chairman IIF Nagpur and Gautam Roy, Secretary IIF Nagpur.

R G Paranjpe, Chairman of IIF Nagpur Chapter spoke about the importance
of this topic and why IIF Nagpur has planned this programme at LIT. He
appealed all the students and faculties to take membership of IIF Nagpur
Chapter. On entrepreneurship, he said, "One must dream and dreams can
come true if one has the courage to pursue them. By passionately
following the path the dream can turn into reality. The hundred-mile
journey eventually starts with the first step." Apart from this, he
said.

"The path of entrepreneurship is not easy, it is full of thorny bushes
throwing challenges but when you successfully overcome them, you will
start feeling charmed of accomplishment that you achieved."

He also added, "Starting a new business requires passion and a clear
vision backed with policies and strategies. One has to constantly face
the odds. Learn through the things and capitalise on experience. And
finally what matters most is your hard work to pursue your path and move
towards the goal."

The objective of the programme was to motivate the young generation to
become 'Job providers and not job seeker'. At the start of the
programme, Student Council member from LIT welcomed all the office
bearers of IIF Nagpur Chapter. More than 200 students from third and
fourth year attended the event. Saurabh Mehta proposed the vote of
thanks, informs a press release.

I use these 5 hacks as a start-up CEO

Here are 5 most important hacks / tools I have learnt in my 7.5 years of
entrepreneurial experience that you can learn too to manage time, effort
better

Life of a start-up founder / CEO is definitely not easy - this everyone
knows. But do you also know that it does not need to be so hard. All you
need to do is plan, manage and communicate better. Over my
entrepreneurial stint of over 7.5 years, here are the 5 most important
hacks / tools I have learnt to use to manage my time and effort in a
much better manner.

Delegate COMPLETELY!

One of the biggest failure of early stage startup CEOs is the tendency
to be doing, knowing and taking care of everything. STOP. You will never
grow a company this way. It too me ages to really learn this as well but
I have learnt my lesson. And, I work everyday towards making myself a
little more redundant so that the startup does not always need me all
the time. It also allows for a lot of process based work that saves
time, effort and money for the startup. Try it!

Do the most BORING work every morning first

Who wants to do the boring work? I know the first word that would come
to your mind is nobody and that is very true. But, you know what?
Startup founders have to do a lot of really boring (can be
administrative, financial, product review, documentation, documentation
review, etc.) work on a daily basis. But, I have found over time that
doing the most boring work first every day without procrastinating makes
the day way more productive as well as the gets the boring work done.

USE Asana + Slack (or, another alternate set of tools)

Managing tasks and communications are a huge chunk of time of any
startup founder's day. Luckily, in the world we live in, there are a lot
of amazing tools that can help you manage tasks and communications way
better than the ways it was done in the past. However, most startups
with small teams (upto 20 folks) are huddled together. This means that a
lot of founders are always talking in person - delegating tasks and
communicating their thoughts. There is a couple of massive downsides of
doing this - one, as your team grows, you are forced to use these tools
but they have not become a part of your startup's DNA and it becomes
much, much harder to implement, and two, you have got a bunch of people
in your team who themselves have never adopted using tools and many
tasks that are verbally set are lost in the chaos of verbal
communications. So, save yourself from this! I use Asana + Slack. You
can use any other that might feel more comfortable for you.

Say NO

This no is for everything that might end up making you spend time less
efficiently than you like. As a startup founder, you always have a heap
load of work to do. Hanging out with friends or getting a coffee for a
casual chat or going to a party or attending startup events or meetings
could be things you end up saying yes to out of courtesy despite knowing
well within you that some of it would be a sheer waste of your time.
Instead of trying to look polite, think how to maximise your
efficiency - learn to say no.

SPEND 70% time planning - looking ahead

If you have understood the first point and have executed on it, you will
know what this one means. Founders don't need to micromanage daily
operations. Time is the only constant commodity for everyone. Effort and
money can vary for each one of us. Even Elon Musk has 24 hours a day.
So, use your time wisely. Any entrepreneur who grew their company will
tell you that most of their time was spend on planning ahead. You as an
entrepreneur must do this because you are the guiding force for the
organization and your team. Entrepreneurs who don't spend a bulk of
their time planning ahead are never able to build the right growth
foundation for their startups.

These 5 hacks have been my friends for over 5 years now and have been
extremely helpful throughout this time. Let me know your thoughts on
these hacks. What other hacks do you use?

Have a great week ahead, folks! Ciao...

No Progress in StartUp India Initiative As DIPP Utilized Only 0.4% of
Allocated ?10 Crore for Promotion

Digit Fast Track

Body

New Delhi, Apr. 05 -- PM Modi's ambitious 'StartUp India' initiative
once again got a question mark when a report by the department-related
Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce said that the Department of
Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) could utilize only Rs 4 lakh (as
on December 31, 2017) out of Rs 10 crore that were allocated to it for
the promotion of StartUp India scheme in 2017-18. The committee
presented its report on March 14.

The Committee expressed concerns about the "huge gap" that exists
between the number of startups receiving funding, tax exemptions and the
number of such entities that have been recognized. Additionally, the
panel observed in its report that, as on February 6, 2018, 6,981
startups have been recognized by the DIPP. Of these startups, only 99
have been funded and 82 have been certified for claiming tax exemptions
under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Asking the DIPP to furnish reasons for the lag in funding recognized
startups, the Committee suggested DIPP to "take concerted measures to
ensure genuine entrepreneurs are provided all the support to flourish
and create jobs."

The panel report further said that the proposed Rs 2,000 crore Credit
Guarantee Fund for startups, announced in January 2016, is still in the
formulation stage and there has been no progress made as the fund has
been again allocated a token amount (of Rs 1 lakh) in Budget Estimate of
2018-19,"

The report also said the panel fears that the functioning of the Startup
India Hub and call centre was hampered due to low utilization of funds.

The above news was first reported in Indian Express.

Notably, this is not the first time when inefficacy of StartUp India
scheme has been revealed, where it was again observed that the much
hyped initiative is not yielding the desired outcome as promised three
years back when it was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in
August 2015 to develop an ecosystem to galvanize entrepreneurship across
the country, through income tax benefits, easy bank financing and lesser
compliance burden.

Last month, a report by Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India
(EDII) also revealed that only 5% of the country's people went on to
establish their own business or startups, which is among the lowest
rates in the world. Moreover, business discontinuation in India is among
the highest in the world at 26.4%, said the EDII report.

Also, an another report revealed that in this year's Asia's
startup-friendly countries list, India stands at 8th rank behind China
and even Malaysia because of the very fact that it is still the poorest
country in Asia with GDP per capita of $1,710, in 2017 and a high
unemployment rate.

Is A Complete Failure!

The Start-Up India campaign has recently completed 2 years of its launch
on January 16, 2018. According to the latest report, (till 28 February
2018) some 5,350 startups have been recognized in the country with over
40,000 employees working in these startups. Surprisingly, the report
said that th worst is that the agency that was designated by the Centre
to disburse funds to startups has released only Rs 337 crore out of Rs
600 crore to only 75 start-ups in 2 years.

All this despite of the fact that exactly a year back industry body
FICCI, in its report, suggested that startups in India need government
support to lesson the number of failures and revealed that startups
success rate is not up to the mark in the country. Perhaps, the
government didn't take FICCI seriously.

The market valuation of Indian startups has grown significantly but
innovation remains the biggest missing piece of the Indian startup
puzzle. Last year, a study - "Entrepreneurial India" - by the IBM
Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics found that 90% of
Indian startups fail within the first five years due to lack of
innovation.

To recall, in 2016's G20 digital entrepreneurship survey too India was
ranked in bottom 10 in group of 20.

Few days back, industry veteran and former Infosys director TV Mohandas
Pai has made a crucial statement concerning Indian startup ecosystem, as
he said that 60% of startups in India may fail owing to lack of market
and other factors. He, however, also added that all startups have bright
future.

There are common mistakes made by young startups, and in this story,
I'll tell you how to solve them and create really successful online
business!

I have recently found a very interesting discussion on Quora.com. It
sounds like: 'What do startup founders typically get wrong when starting
a business?'

And in my opinion, it is one of the hottest topics in the startup era.
So, below I added my list of the most common mistakes made by young
entrepreneurs.

1. Lack of a clear development plan.

2. Incorrect identification of the target audience or just ignoring this
step.

3. Using wrongheaded strategy copying of all steps of the competitor.

4. Too large investments which in the future don't pay off (This results
from 1 and 2 points).

5. Choosing too complex a business model for implementation. It's
strange, but for some reason, many young businesses do not follow the
proven rule "the simplicity of genius".

6. Saving money on promotion.

7. Choosing the wrong developers.

8. Choosing the wrong promotion specialists.

9. Involving too many employees for an easy task or charging a large
number of tasks to one person.

Unfortunately, this list can be even longer in some cases.

A lot of beginning entrepreneurs fail because they are simply not ready
to implement the conceived concept. But it is good that in 2018, there
are many opportunities for growing and developing startups. Remember, do
not make this harder than it has to be.

The next list contains simple but working solutions that lead to a
really profitable business. It's about the online marketplace business.

* Drawing on your knowledge, skills or hobbies, determine a niche for
creating your future marketplace.

* Analyze in this area (the competitor analysis is very useful) and
determine your target audience (make a detailed portrait for your
sellers and buyers).

* Choose the most suitable platform based on your financial
possibilities and type of the trading platform.

* On the basis of the chosen platform, determine the payment tool that
is right for you.

* Use all free methods at the first stage of promoting your marketplace
(SMM, SEO, YouTube, blogging, guest posting, etc.).

* Do not leave without attention and paid methods of promotion (target
ads, contextual ads, influencer marketing, YouTube, etc.). If you do not
have experience in marketing, the best option is to hire professionals
specializing in the promotion in this field.

* Read and study a lot about the marketplace business.

[YS Learn] Lessons Indian companies can emulate from the Israeli startup

With over $10 billion in exits, Israel has built a global startup
ecosystem to reckon with. Here's what Indian companies can learn from
this success.

The Israeli startup ecosystem has given birth to several unicorns,
produced successful exits, and built several deep-tech products. The
young nation, founded in 1948, is approximately 20,000 sq km - possibly
as big as a district in India. But, the country, with a population of
over eight million, delivered over 100 exits in 2017.

In 2019, this number doubled nearly, and while there is dip this year
due to the pandemic, the Israeli startup ecosystem and its ability to
build great tech products is still strong. The total value of exits for
Israel's startups actually stands at $10 billion.

Recently, Redis Labs, co-founded by Israeli techie Yiftach Shoolman,
entered the unicorn club with a $100 million funding.

According to a World Economic Forum Report, Israel ranked sixth in the
world according to the Startup Genome's Startup-Ecosystem Ranking in
2019.

In Start-Up Nation - The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle, authors Dan
Senor and Saul Singer explain how the small nation's adversity driven
culture actually fosters a combination of innovative and entrepreneurial
intensity.

"Israel has more companies on the NASDAQ than Korea, Japan, Singapore,
and all of Europe - combined" added the book.

"While Americans emphasise decorum and exhaustive preparation, Israelis
put chutzpah (meaning 'extreme confidence')first," it said.

So, what are the factors that make Israel a great ecosystem and its
entrepreneurs different? And can Indian startups learn anything from
them?

Finding solution in diversity

Yiftach says, "It is the DNA in the people of Israel to find a solution
for any problem and improvise. Israel has so many enemies that you need
to survive right and find other ways of finding a solution."

The people of the country simply aren't trained to accept failure.

According to Yiftach, "The intelligence service in itself is a great
faculty for computer science, where young people learn to code and
write. We win not because we are bigger or stronger it is because we
find ways in diversity and use technology. Today everyone learns to find
solutions."

The World Economic Forum talks of SpaceIL, a startup that was looking at
the first Israeliunmanned moon landing but after nine years of work and
millions of dollars of investment later, the attempt failed.

Immediately, the team announced a second attempt; saying that one
failure didn't mean there was no reason to try again.

Strong support system

Incidentally, SpaceIL was able to announce a second attempt because it
had strong support from the government and investors.

WEF wrote, "The Amazon Web Services headquarters in Tel Aviv has an
entire floor available to the public for organising community events,
while Intel-the largest employer in Israel-actively supports diversity
programmes."

Apart from this, almost every Israeli startup has an immediate global
expansion. This is primarily also because they are a small nation and
the teams automatically look for a global market.

Also, with close to 45 percent of the population under 24, schools have
a stronger push towards entrepreneurial learning.

"There is a strong push towards responsibility towards their actions.
The army also plays a strong role in Israel. Each is pushed to have
higher and deeper aspirations," says Yiftach.

Wolfgang Grundinger, adviser to the German Association of the Digital
Economy said to WEF, "Just as in the Israeli military, where talented
individuals in their twenties have the opportunity to be responsible for
their own budget and lead teams and projects, other countries should
push young leaders to take on responsibility earlier and empower them to
lead their countries into a digital future."

Different view on failure

As Dan Senor and Saul Singer say, "It isn't that Israeli's are immune
from the universally high failure rate of startups, but Israeli culture
and regulations reflect a unique attitude to failure, one that has
managed to repeatedly bring failed entrepreneurs back into the system to
constructively use their experience to try again, rather than leave them
permanently stigmatised and marginalised."

They add that in a world seeking the key to innovation, Israel is a
natural place to look. "Israeli attitude and informality flow also from
a cultural tolerance for what some Israelis call - 'constructive
failures' or 'intelligent failures'."

The authors write, "Most local investors believe that without tolerating
a large number of these failures, it is impossible to achieve true
innovation. For example, in the Israeli military, there is a tendency to
treat all performance - both successful and unsuccessful - in training
and simulations, and sometimes even in battle as value-neutral.

So long as the risk was taken intelligently, and not recklessly, there
is something to be learnt.

The Israeli military says, "We don't cheerlead you excessively for a
good performance, and we don't finish you off permanently for a bad
performance."

Startups urged to overcome challenges for success

Assam Tribune (India)

December 8, 2019 Sunday

Dateline: GUWAHATI

Body

GUWAHATI, Dec. 8 -- Startups, with their objective of innovating
breakthrough solutions to crucial problems, have emerged as a
developmental necessity of the 21st century. Nevertheless, the fact that
they have to scale up faster with limited resources compared to the
traditional businesses also pose critical challenges on the way. The
startups often struggle to balance the emphasis between the greater goal
of implementing a solution, building a competent team, mobilising
resources, urgency of profit making and finding investors.

Keeping this in mind, a fireside chat on 'Surviving the Startup Valley
of Death' was organised recently at Assam Startup ' The Nest, in
association with IIM, Calcutta Innovation Park.

According to a report, around 90 per cent of the startups get stuck at
various stages in the initial phases of starting up and fail to become
sustainable and scalable businesses. The entrepreneurs need to overcome
the challenges of a new venture and learn to navigate the valley of
death, which typically spans from ideation to breakeven stage. The
objective of the fireside chat was to delve into the various challenges
and try to identify strategies to survive the startup valley of death.

The expert panel for the session included Srikant Sastri, Chairman, IIM
Calcutta Innovation Park; Dr Subhrangshu Sanyal, CEO, IIM Calcutta
Innovation Park; Vikram Duggal, Managing Partner, Ekcle Ventures &#38;
Ekcle Advisory Services; Devasis Gupta, Director, Binary Fusion
International Pvt Ltd; and Bajrang Lohia, Managing Director, Lohia Group
of Industries.

Addressing the 30 startups who had gathered at The Nest for the session,
Srikant Sastri encouraged the startups to put their names down in
history by innovating solutions for ushering in developmental changes in
society.

'On an average, for every crore of capital deployed, a startup creates
10 to 15 jobs, which stands higher than the 0.68 jobs created against
per crore by large companies. So, if India has to use its capital wealth
in a sensible manner, money should be put into startups and small
businesses,' he added.

Talking about startup failures, Dr Sanyal underlined the regularity of
failure while implementing a solution. 'When you are trying to implement
a new solution, failure becomes more common than success. So, be
prepared for failure. But remember that the people who have persevered
after failure, because they are truly passionate about solving a
problem, have shown higher rates of success,' he said.

Some of the key points emphasised during the session to overcome the
possibilities of failure were the need for identifying crucial areas for
best professional hiring, importance of working on customer feedback,
making key decisions on selecting the right types of investment, among
others.

Sustainablility is what business models of young companies need to boost
employability, skill building; The contribution of sustainable business
models is not limited to employment opportunities. It impacts the
quality of lives, opening of global markets, and most importantly can
nurture the talent and augment skills building.

With 1,300 new tech start-ups added in 2019 India's count of tech
start-ups stood at about 9300 according to the latest NASSCOM report on
the Indian Tech Start-up Ecosystem. The Indian startup ecosystem is
thriving and in fact, disrupting conventional business models. Last
year, NASSCOM reported a 108 per cent growth in funding for Indian
startups as compared to 2017. This news holds within its fine print the
promise of better economic growth, bolder innovation and value creation
with the report citing 60,0000 direct jobs created by Start-ups in 2019.
A welcome relief for a nation currently grappling with the effects that
the economic slowdown has brought on.

Employability and Impact

Giving rise to allied and related business which directly and indirectly
create employment and lead to economic prosperity, startups can reshape
and redefine cities and towns. As the fastest startup to become a
unicorn, touching the $1-billion mark, Swiggy is a fine example of the
impact that is possible. Recently the startup announced its plan to hire
3 lakh people in the next 18 months, taking its total strength to 5 Lakh
and becoming the third-largest employer preceded just by the Indian Army
and Railways. Swiggy's success is directly linked to a successful and
sustainable hyperlocal business model.

Their focus on building an extensive logistics network was accompanied
by massive direct and indirect employment generation. That is one of
many instances of the impact that startups have through direct
employment opportunities. Additionally, it is well known, that startups
possess the great capability to not only provide options of direct
employment but also give rise to many ancillary and boutique services in
their wake, making markets more accessible and creating
micro-entrepreneurs along the way.

Another example of this transformative impact can be seen through the
story of the industrial city of Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, from the
archives to see how impact creation can truly stand the test of time. An
otherwise challenged city was alchemized with the entry of Tata Steel
and rechristened through that influence 'Tata Nagar' or 'Steel City'.
Today despite the fact that it is not on the official list of cities
under the government's Smart Cities Mission, it is trooping ahead to
become one, nonetheless. Tata Steel carved out Jamshedpur Utilities and
Services Co. Ltd (JUSCO) from its Town Services Division in 2004, which
is a unique utility company in the country providing different utility
services like water, power and waste management in the city. Now JUSCO
is working on IoT projects with Tata Communications to improve utility
services in Jamshedpur in order to further enhance the lives of its over
one million residents.

Caution and Support

Such success stories, however, in the Indian startup system can seem
like lucky strokes, if you look at the number of organizations that fall
to the wayside while on the mountain climb that is entrepreneurship.
With a high failure rate, most startups appear on the scene with a bang,
holding much promise and creating many jobs, but only a few survive the
challenges of continued innovation, adequate funding and efficient
business models.

If we want more examples of success as a nation, it would be foolhardy
to then rely only on an individual's ingenuity in order to duplicate the
success few have been able to achieve. What these examples show us, is
an urgent need for all stakeholders in the startup ecosystem to pull
together to home in on creating support structures that allow for
businesses to learn as they grow and build robust business models,
sustainable employment roadmaps and ensure skill-building opportunities
along the entire way. In short, we need structured and continuous
knowledge sharing even in the entrepreneurial sphere, now more than
ever, in order to ensure there are more hits than misses in the startup
space in India.

Beyond Employment

Evidently, the contribution of sustainable startup business models is
not limited to the employment opportunities they create. It impacts the
quality of lives, opening of global markets and most importantly can
nurture the talent and augment skills building. More often than not, in
conventional businesses, individuals work in silos, merely on their
niche, without acquiring newer and more relevant skills. Startups are
increasingly turning the table. Small teams, flat hierarchies, multiple
roles and direct responsibilities positions startups uniquely to add to
the skill development of their employees.

As most startups believe in the efficiency of a lean time, it is not
surprising that employees have to multitask and dabble into tasks that
go beyond their area of expertise. While some may view this as an added
burden, others view it as a way to pick up new skills that will last.
Additionally, employment opportunities in a startup come with a need to
work on adaptability and self-learning skills. By the virtue of being a
new entity, startups seldom have well-defined roles and responsibilities
and all members learn on the job, harbouring new skills every day.

In the same light, startup success also depends a lot on its ability to
understand and react to the changing market conditions. This may mean
ensuring continuous skills development to remain relevant in a
competitive market. A business can only be sustainable if it is focused
on creating an environment where learning is encouraged, and
forward-thinking is staunchly supported. Not only does this outlook
encourage better retention rates as employee motivation is managed
better but it also acts as a fuel for business growth with new ideas
ensuring a right to win in the market. Funding, people and business
value become natural outcomes for a flourishing startup that has spent
sufficient time on building a foundation of strong values, placing
greater emphasis on building and growing a sound business that delivers
value and is scalable.

12 business leaders and entrepreneurs talk about the books that moved,
inspired and entertained them - from Nadella on Microsoft to Manjerkar's
autobiography.Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, CMD, Biocon BOOK: Bad Blood: Secret
and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou "The book reveals
the darker side of a biotech start-up, Theranos, founded by a highly
networked young woman, Elizabeth Holmes, who was often referred to as
the female Steve Jobs! What was chilling was the way the VC community
lapped up an un-validated technology based on a galaxy of High Networth
Investors and board members and gave it a staggering $9-billion
valuation! As a biotech entrepreneur, it led me to believe that we
function in a sinister ecosystem where fortunes are built and destroyed
at the whims of influential VCs and investors who hardly do any due
diligence. It therefore begs the question of their integrity and
fiduciary responsibilities. Theranos will be remembered as a biotech
fraud that was either a premeditated mega scam or a massive start-up
failure.

"Bharat Puri, MD, Pidilite IndustriesBOOK: Imperfect by Sanjay
Manjrekar"As a cricket aficionado, I've seen that a lot of biographies
tend to be like PR tomes -- always soft-stepping controversial issues.
After long, one read a cricket book that is unvarnished. Manjrekar has
exposed his vulnerabilities, talked about his failures, and given an
inside view of how cricket was back then: whether it was the rivalry
between players from the west and the north, or the seniors expecting
deification."Manish Sabharwal, chairman & co-founder, Teamlease
ServicesBOOK: Gandhi: The years That Changed the World by Ramachandra
Guha"I knew Gandhiji was at war with the British but he was also at war
with India with his three other goals: religious tolerance, ending
untouchability and economic self-reliance. He sought out a debate with

a consistency in his inconsistency. He was an advocate of patience - he
believed violence was a form of impatience - but he ran out of patience

Our Final Invention by James Barrat"Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a
subject is riveting. The possibilities of applying it to my work of

thinking of the possibility of combining Ayurvedic inheritance with AI.
I felt it would be ideal for our treatments and therapeutic products,
which can be even more personalised. It can take an individual skin or
hair profile into account and then manufacture products accordingly. The
possibilities are limitless, but the fact remains that it is human
intelligence that helps to prepare the systems of AI. The book also
warns us of the dangers of the pendulum swinging the other way, where AI
will rule human intelligence."Niranjan Hiranandani, MD, Hiranandani
GroupBOOK: My Vision: Challenges in the Race for Excellence by Mohammed

history of Dubai -- how from being a poor country with most of the oil
resources in Abu Dhabi, Dubai took to pearl trading to sustain itself.
But with the Japanese learning the art of artificial pearl-making,
Dubai's pearl industry was destroyed. It was something they turned into
an opportunity. Dubai invested big time into building ports, airports
and other infrastructure --something possible under strong leadership
and good use of technology. The author talks about the efforts they are
still making towards 'excellence in development'. The key takeaway from
the book is: do not worry over deficiency. Have a vision. And take
action to execute that vision."Vinita Jain, founder-chairman,

I identified with many aspects of the story. Though the plot is serious,
I liked the humour and lightness of not giving two fudges to most of

repeatedly and reflect. A funny book doesn't win a Pulitzer for
nothing."Deep Kalra, cofounder, MakemytripBOOK: Prisoners of Geography

WHILE dealing with big companies, startups in India often fail to meet
the expectations of their established counterparts and many times they
loose businesses. This is one of the major causes of failure of
startups, said Co-founder of Z Nation Lab Neha Jain while speaking at
the Startup Accelerator workshop organised here by the Nagpur Chapter of
TiE on Sunday. The workshop was organised in association with Nagpur
Startup and E-Cell of the Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology
(VNIT).

The other speakers were Cofounder of Dreamkats Indranil Datta, Founder
of Nodd Shuham Rai, CEO of Darwyn Rahul Gonsalves, Adesh Gundecha of
Anmol Trunkey Solutions and others. Elaborating Jain said that startups
must keep themselves upgrading so as to survive in the highly
competitive markets. She observed that needs and challenges of each
startup are very different depending on the nature of sector they are
operating in. Thus, Jain who is holding degree in Architecture and a
startup accelerator, felt that the all the startups need to the dealt
differently. She advised the startups to focus on technology and upgrade
them selves at regular interval of time. "Most of the businesses in
today's world are technology driven and thus it need constant
upgradation," she said.

Jain said that startups should not shay away from discussing their
issues with mentors. "They must ask questions and try to resolve them.
Besides, they should also build a strong network," she said. At present
Jain is dealing with 25 different portfolios of startups out of which 10
are in USA. Emphasizing on market strategies, another speaker Indranil
Datta, pointed out that startups should clearly identify their customers
before hand. "One must have a clear understanding of his customers and
must be firm on his core business values," he said adding that one
should elaborately plan his sales strategies. He then classified overall
customers in different categories based on their buying capabilities and
nature.

"There are 'risk takers' who do not hesitate to try new products. Then
there are 'early doctors' who try and test the products for quite long.
Apart from this, there are 'misleading guys' who oppose the buyers and
try to cretae negative openion in the market," he explaned. Datta also
said that a startup should possess the qualities of risk taker.

Rahul Gonsalves, a first year engineering drop out, said that startups
should learn the art of understanding the core problem before trying to
fix it. "You need to look at the problem from all possible angles. It
will help you find out solution on it," he said. "For a service provider
start up, it is necessary for him to understand that his services are of
top quality provided at a very competitive pricing," he said. Further,
he elaborated on how customers differentiate on cost, quality and time,
which according to him are main parameters for any buyer.

Shubham Rai, also expressed his view and gave tips to the participants.
He urged the participants to understand the needs of customers.

Milind Chatterwar, President of TiE Nagpur, introduced the speakers.
Nidhi Bawashe, Executive Director, TiE Nagpur proposed the vote of
thanks.

19 State Govts Implemented Startup Policies, Flaunts Govt Conveniently
Hiding Stats That Count

Digit Fast Track

New Delhi, Apr. 10 -- After over two years of launch of 'Start-Up India'
initiative, 19 state governments - out of 29 states total - have
implemented startup policies with a view to promote budding
entrepreneurs in the country, reported many publication including TOI,
Indian Express, citing commerce and industry ministry official
statement.

Notably, at the time of launch of StartUp India initiative in January
2016, only four states had started startup policy, whereas 19 states
have implemented startup policies now, said the commerce ministry in an
official statement. In April 2016, there were only 7 states who had
implemented startup policy.

At the launch of the initiative Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a
slew of incentives to boost startup businesses, offering them a tax
holiday, inspector raj-free regime and capital gains tax exemption as
part of the startup action plan.

Later in February this year, state/UT startup ranking framework has been
launched in order to encourage states to take proactive steps towards
strengthening the startup ecosystems within their jurisdictions.

Further, to promote innovation among startups, the ministry provides 80%
rebate in patent filing fees and 50% on trade mark filing fees. However,
the monster of so called Angel Tax still haunts the startups.

Initiative, Till Date

The ministry also revealed that 423 patent facilitators and 596
trademark facilitators have been nominated to promote innovation among
startups. The initiative has benefited 671 patent applicants, 941
trademark applicants along with 144 expedited examinations.

The ministry also said that international bilateral cooperation with
countries having strong startup ecosystems - Israel, Singapore, Portugal
and Sweden - have been entered into by Startup India Hub to facilitate
market access and promote investments.

Time to time, the government is keep giving the report, facts and
figures of its ambitious start-up India initiative but at the same time
also hiding the bad figures & statistics when it comes to the ground
results shown by the much hyped startup initiative. The commerce
ministry is conveniently keeping ignorant when it comes to feedback and
suggestion for startup ecosystem in India, be it from veteran industry
bodies within the country or startup-related organizations outside
India. Read our January 2017 story on the success Of 'Startup India'
programme.

Few days back, a report a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce
said that the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) could
utilize only Rs 4 lakh (as on December 31, 2017) out of Rs 10 crore that
were allocated to it for the promotion of StartUp India scheme in
2017-18.

The Committee expressed concerns about the "huge gap" that exists
between the number of startups receiving funding, tax exemptions and the
number of such entities that have been recognized and further said that
the proposed Rs 2,000 crore Credit Guarantee Fund for startups,
announced in January 2016, is still in the formulation stage and there
has been no progress made.

Last year, a 91-year-old industry body FICCI, in its report, suggested
that startups in India need government support to minimize the number of
failures and revealed that startups success rate is not up to the mark
in the country. The government, apparently busy in its religious
obligations, didn't take FICCI seriously.

In the same month, a report by Entrepreneurship Development Institute of
India (EDII) also revealed that only 5% of the country's people went on
to establish their own business or startups, which is among the lowest
rates in the world. Moreover, business discontinuation in India is among
the highest in the world at 26.4%, said the EDII report.

Also, an another report revealed that in this year's Asia's
startup-friendly countries list, India stands at 8th rank behind China
and even Malaysia because of the very fact that it is still the poorest
country in Asia with GDP per capita of $1,710, in 2017 and a high
unemployment rate.

Founders' Biggest Mistakes Are About People

Business Barons

July 2022

July 19 -- The founders of start-up companies today are doing a lot
that's right. But they're also doing much that's wrong, and the
consequences of their actions for the global economy in the decades
ahead are likely to be considerable. 

Entrepreneurship is booming. Entrepreneurs applied for federal
tax-identification numbers to register 4.54 million new businesses from
January through October last year, up 56% from the same period of 2019
and the largest number since 2004, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. 

On the plus side of the ledger, these entrepreneurs are still taking
risks and making tough decisions. They're still pursuing innovation and
seeking solid sources of financing. They still take on the
responsibilities of creating products, services and organizations where
none existed before.  

 

As a result, founders are performing well when it comes to developing
products and securing financing. For example, crowdfunding and
special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have emerged as viable
alternatives, giving founders more leverage and flexibility for raising
capital.  

That said, the most common mistakes in launching a new enterprise have
nothing to do with products or financing, but, rather, with the
decisions that founders make early on about people.

Yes, people. That's what my research has found. I analyzed data on
10,000 founders for a book published a decade ago, The Founder's
Dilemmas, and have found that these mistakes still persist today. In
fact, the biggest reason for the famed high rate of failure in startups
is the early decisions about people that go awry.  

Indeed, 65% of the failures of high-potential startups are due to
"people problems," including frictions between co-founders or tensions
between the founders and other team members, a study by Bill Sahlman of
Harvard Business School and Michael Gorman of McKinsey revealed 40 years
ago. Almost the same exact result came out in another study 20 years
later, this time by Steven Kaplan and Per Stromberg in the Journal of
Finance. My own long-time studies of entrepreneurship suggest that such
a study conducted now would likely show the same pattern. 

 

Here, then, are the three main mistakes founders keep making about
people:  

They partner with co-founders like themselves. Sociologists have a word
for it: homophily. Humans like to associate with people similar to
themselves. Two techies or two business people are far more likely to
found a tech startup than a "one and one" team that includes a business
person and technologist.  But if the partners have the same backgrounds
or skills, they seek similar roles. Such overlap can cause tensions,
leave unfilled gaps, and weaken the team. Founding teams need
different-and complementary-abilities and mindsets in order to overcome
the inclination toward homophily.  

If one partner is good at "inside" skills, such as operations and
product development, they're better off if the other is stronger at
"outside" skills, such as sales, marketing and business development.
Otherwise key functions are neglected. Few founders are talented enough
to do everything well. Even those who are and try to do everything
themselves will slow down the startup. Finding co-founders who are
different from each other is difficult but essential. 

They split ownership equally. Founders often split equity equally, even
though they often contribute to an enterprise unequally. Such splits are
ill-conceived, because they usually mean the founders avoided or delayed
tackling, early on, the typically difficult conversation about ownership
and contributions. That conversation should delve into the differences
in how much value each partner brings to the startup. It's rarely a
50-50 proposition. One member of the team is invariably doing more than
another, but with an equal split, that most central member of the team
will be receiving less equity than earned and feeling short-changed.
Robin Chase, a co-founder of Zipcar, split equally with her co-founder
and came to regret it. When she visited my class to discuss her
co-founder dynamics, she talked about her "stupid handshake agreement"
that had caused her "years of angst." 

 

The arrangement that results from this difficult conversation should
also take into account how the division of labor between partners could
change over time-as it all but inevitably will-and how the equity split
should acknowledge the existence of uncertainty and thus include dynamic
elements. Facebook is a classic case in point. Mark Zuckerberg
negotiated a bad early split with co-founder Eduardo Saverin that
resisted a belated fix. When Zuckerberg later sought to reclaim
Saverin's 30% of the business and shrink Saverin's role, he ran into
significant legal problems. Calling this situation, in which Zuckerberg
gave up billions of dollars of equity value, a cautionary tale is an
understatement of the first order. 

They want to be king (or queen) as well as rich. The precedents set by
the likes of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates mislead first-time founders into
assuming that they, too, can be both king of their company and rich. Not
only do the data show that those founders are outliers, but even they
failed to be both rich and king in their first startups. For Gates,
Microsoft was his third attempt at founding, and Jobs was never "king"
or CEO of Apple for its first twenty years. 

Even when they are able to remain kings in control of their ventures,
founders do not realize what they have to give up as a result. Among the
founders of 6,130 startups I studied, the ones who remained as CEO and
controlled the board of directors held equity stakes only 52% as
valuable-approximately half!-as founders who gave the reins. And they
have to beware that a founder-CEO's success at leading a fast-growing
startup can actually accelerate his or her own obsolescence and
replacement-the paradox of entrepreneurial success.

Usually the rich-versus-king dilemma rears its head even before the
actual founding. Founders should remember that passion and confidence
are great early strengths, but can also become great weaknesses. They're
well-advised to weigh the recurring tradeoffs involved in keeping
control of a company versus bringing onboard people with the savvy to
grow its value: Should they go it alone or find a co-founder who will
also want to call the shots? Self-fund a company or accept funding from
outside investors who may want to share key decisions?   

The people conundrums that founders confronted decades ago still exist
today because human nature, with all its attendant biases, has remained
largely the same. Counteracting those biases can pay big dividends for
founders and for society alike. The smartest founders will understand
that business is business, but it's personal, too.

Why Some Startups Succeed And Others Fail?

Dataquest

A perinial question every wannabe hustler to entrapruner to VCs ask. The
answer is not that simple, a combination of factors make a start up or
break it

An old adage might serve as an inspiration for all the startups. It
says, Rise and rise again until lambs become lions. As always, feel good
quotes are like sugar quoted pills - once the motivational sugar
dissolves, the realities kick in. The last couple of years, the
entrepreneurial bug has hit the Indian shores big time. Buoyed by the
eCom boom the air is riddled with startups, but a good deal of start-ups
just creates a buzz and goes into oblivion.

While we see enthusiastic debates and conversations from both the
Government and the VC community, time is now for us to ask the critical
question- why some startups fail and some succeed?

At the fundamental level, a broader answer would border on perspectives
like a failed startup tracing its etiology to the founders' inability to
draw up a short term and long-term sustenance road map or a lack of
vision and mission statement. For instance, we have heard stories of
many startups fizzling out in just 12 months, either losing the initial
capital pooled in by founders or losing the investor confidence.

A Deal Street Asia observation sometime back said, There is hardly any
systemic data on startups in terms of how well they are doing and how do
they compare. What it leads to is the lack of success benchmarks or one
is constrained when it comes to appraisal of the startups for lack of
key measurement parameters.

A LetsVenture- Axilor survey (a survey done with 532 early stage
startups - between 18 to 24 months old) revealed that, 75% of startups
that are still in ideation or beta, believe that funding is a primary
challenge when they should actually be spending time on customer
validation. About 80% said a funding round would be a major milestone,
again showing an oversized focus on funds before they're ready for it.

More perplexing is that the survey pointed out: About 70% of founders
said they founded a startup because they thought it was an interesting
idea or they had a problem or knew someone who had a problem that needed
to be solved, without prior experience of startup operations. Just 18%
of founders said they had worked on a similar problem before.

WHEN THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD

A lot of factors contribute to a startups success. An interesting IBM
titled Entrepreneurial India' last year revealed some interesting
insights. This entrepreneurial study conducted by the IBM Institute for
Business Value (IBV) based on a survey done in collaboration with Oxford
Economics, to understand the rapidly evolving India startup ecosystem
and its effects on the wider economy. The results reveal that startups
can exploit a range of attributes and advantages unique to India. More
than 76% of Indian executives pointed to India's economic openness as a
major business advantage, while 60% identified India's skilled workforce
and 57% of the executives said that India's large domestic market
provides significant advantages.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Key findings of the survey revealed that more than 90% startups in
  India fail in their first 5 years. Lack of pioneering innovation (77%)
  is the topmost reason for the failure of most Indian startups. India's
  economic openness (76%), skilled workforce (60%) and large domestic
  market (57%) seen as major business advantages for startups. Around 73%
  of Indian business leaders surveyed believe that ecosystems can help
  accelerate innovation.Almost 80% of executives from established
  companies say collaboration with startups accelerates new ideas
  Stakeholders' (established businesses, startups, VCs, Government,
  Higher education) involvement and contribution is key to creating a
  conducive environment for the success of startup economy
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The IBM study is based on interviews with more than 1,300 Indian
executives, including 600 startup entrepreneurs, 100 venture
capitalists, 100 government leaders, 500 leaders of established
companies and 22 educational institution leaders to analyze the macro
impact of startups on the economic growth of the country. The study
further focuses on how more proactive engagement between startup and
established organizations can help startups harden their business
models, accelerate growth and leapfrog into the big leagues, while
enabling established companies to share in the entrepreneurial spirit of
innovation and agility. Their mutual success will drive India toward an
ever-more dynamic future.

The study also said that the Startup activity is driving India's
emerging business ecosystems India's startup community is expanding
rapidly with a strong entrepreneurial culture, especially among
millennials. Strong government promotion of entrepreneurship has
strengthened a rapidly evolving startup culture - a proposed reduction
in corporate tax from 30% to 25% is expected to further boost startup
activity. The study further stated that market valuation of Indian
startups has grown significantly over the past four years, with three
times increase in startup investment recorded in 2015. According to the
study, approximately 35% of startups are being set up in tier two and
tier three cities, thereby promoting accelerated development and
industrialization of rural and other less developed areas.

TAKEAWAYS

Clearly, the Indian start up ecosystem is at an intersection, the
much-needed coming of age has to happen- the boys to men transition. The
oft-repeated cliched success stories like Flipkart or OLA or Snapdeal or
handful of such example no longer hold good. They cashed in on the first
round of opportunity and leveraged in on the early mover advantage and
rock solid investor confidence.

So as we gather the random pieces of failed and success stories, we can
say that the vision and the mission is lacking in many startup ventures
that are bound to fail in time. And moreover, if the founders lack the
multi-domain expertise and depend on hires to jumpstart their startups,
they are asking for trouble. For instance, if you are an app startup,
founders must have hands on expertise in coding, sales and marketing.
The founders are the visionaries, who need to build the foundation brick
by brick and create a solid structure that seamlessly meshes on one
great idea into a well-knit business model that monetizes the whole
idea.

Who is an Entrepreneur?

An entrepreneur could be any or combination of: inventor, first to
attempt to bring an idea to reality, source of ideas / concepts,
innovator, provider of goods or services; an individual who starts a new
business and risks the seed capital towards growth of the business.

Entrepreneurs play an essential role for economic and social development
of any country. Apart from the financial impact of their ventures, they
also generate jobs and create a sense of optimism in the society. With
their ability to raise funds with risk-discounted equity and to serve
customers with constantly evolving competition, they do set benchmark
for true industry standards, even for an existing one or a new sector.
For every successful entrepreneur who is celebrated in the market, there
are probably over 1,00,000 entrepreneurs who attempted and failed, and
are unsung. An entrepreneur can be a wonderful growth-catalyst for an
economy. Every new venture provides for capital formation, making a
positive impact on societal acceptance of newer idea and more
importantly the utilisation of human capital.

Encouraging entrepreneurship is a good way to engage with large sets of
population, especially the youth. Every successful new venture that
scales up well, has a direct positive impact in encouraging new
entrepreneurs in believing in that concept. For every successful
concept, an entire value chain of products and service companies
start-up and hence create a networked-entrepreneurship model.

Existing businesses may remain confined to their markets and eventually
hit a revenue ceiling. New products / services and new innovations
generate additional headroom of public spending and this induces
economic growth. For instance, consider the online gaming companies -
the lack of avenues for entertainment encourages consumers to adopt
pocket- sized entertainment measures like casual gaming and fantasy
gaming which is bite-sized in cost but with large volumes is driving a
rapid growth in this industry.

The Indian startup ecosystem in this century

Indian startup ecosystem has come of age. While India has always been an
entrepreneurial ecosystem (even Infosys, Wipro were startups at some
point), the first wave of venture funded startups started in 1999-2000.
Since then, there has been a sea change in the opportunity set, capital
availability, talent, regulatory support, exit environment and
everything related to the ecosystem.

After a failed start in the 90s, the real start of the startup ecosystem
happened around 2004-05 with the booming markets. Since a humble
beginning of around a few hundred million US dollars invested a year in
the early stages, today India witnesses over $35 b in investments in the
PE/VC space. Within this, early stage startups account for over $2
billion annually. The underlying opportunity set is growing by nearly
200-300 companies being registered every day. Even assuming hardly 10%
of these are truly entrepreneurial ventures (and not subsidiaries of
other firms), we are looking at over 500 companies opening up each
month. There are roughly 800 - 1000 Indian companies getting venture
investment each year. Yet, this is hardly 10% of the investments seen in
the US - showing enormous headroom for growth.

From a nascent market with limited exits in the past, the last few years
have shown the strength of the Indian startup ecosystem with exits for
investors - be it VCs or angel investors. Exits are a crucial link to a
sustained startup ecosystem as angel investors and institutional
investors are able to plough back the proceeds into new investments
thereby nurturing the ecosystem further.

The average age of founders has fallen drastically from around 40s in
the first decade of this century, to around early 20s now. This is
significant to note - there is no more a stigma attached to a high
failure rate option like starting up. The market today sees serial
entrepreneurs in their 30s startup up their 2nd or 3rd venture.

With India now having the second highest number of internet users in the
world, there are numerous India-specific business opportunities that are
opening up. Gaming and pocket-sized entertainment is one of the fast
growing opportunities which needs localization to make it monetizable.
The growth of fantasy games around cricket is a telling example of this.

Similarly, consumer apps that improve the lives of SMEs are going to be
big. Digital finance is another area where many young as well as
experienced professionals are creating newer sachet-products for India,
not limiting it to only urban pockets.

Making of an entrepreneur & their lemmas :

An entrepreneur, apart from many of their qualities and personality
types have these capabilities that set them apart. This allows them to
compete even when their ideas are seen as audacious or being ridiculed.

* Staunch conviction about their idea; that they can be mistaken for
being adamant and arrogant

* Innate ability to multi-task almost 24x7 with signs of frenzied
energy; that it can be mistaken for helicopter-leadership

* Emotional strength to deal with rejections or disappointments and
criticisms repeatedly; that people mistake the personality to be "thick
skinned"

A trilemma is described as "a situation in which a difficult choice has
to be made among three alternatives, especially when these three are
equally favourable or equally undesirable."

The famous science fiction writer Arthur Clarke cited a management
trilemma encountered when trying to achieve production quickly and
cheaply while maintaining high quality. A service industry typically has
the challenge of wanting to be the quickest-to-the-market, with
highest-quality-parameters and at lowest-cost or highest-margins. The
management strategies of firms differ in the way they see the above
variables. Some of them see it as dilemma to resolve and some of them
choose it as a trilemma. The outcomes determine their market choice.

Entrepreneurs are constantly encountered with three key priority aspects
to choose from:

* the staunch conviction which keeps them going with no regard to what
anyone thinks,

* the constant feedback / opinion that dissuades them from pursuing the
path for the risk of failure.

* keeping an eye out for that alternative path to decide when to take
that right turn, away from the push and pull!

Irrational optimism is a very important element to visualize the big
picture which nobody else is able to see and drive towards that
direction. In their quest to accelerate towards this grand vision,
entrepreneurs cannot ignore the market feedback coming in every moment
of the journey - however succumbing to the feedback (which more often
than not focuses on why its a bad idea) and stopping short is not an
option. However if the feedback is indeed valid, it is better off to
stop, re-check and re-start. This internal push and external pull is a
constant dichotomy faced by entrepreneurs. The most interesting of the
lot is the ability of the entrepreneur to constantly watch out for
adjacencies and completely disconnected ideas which sometimes throws
open new possibilities, which were never thought before. One could see
these as distractions or opportunities. A smart entrepreneur always
educating her/himself on the innumerous possibilities disconnected from
their own day to day business and taking the right call on which
distraction to turn into an opportunity.

This trilemma of accelerate forward, apply brakes or take a right turn
is a very important framework to bear in mind as one navigates the
interesting journey of starting up. As the saying goes, entrepreneurship
is at its best when experienced as a journey, than chasing the end-goal
alone!

SINGAPORE - It was not too long ago that detractors were pouring cold
water on Singapore's efforts to nurture entrepreneurs and startups. For
example, a 2012 Reuters' article headlined "Failure to launch: Singapore
start-ups struggle to woo investors", talked about how the Republic's
push "to become a hotbed for entrepreneurs is stuck at stage one" and
only 2 per cent of the total venture capital investment in Asia were
flowing into Singapore. A 2015 report by technology media Tech in Asia
noted that in 2012, only 104 funding deals were made in Singapore,
amounting to US$233.85 million (S$329 million). It may have been a slow
start for Singapore but within a decade, what had seemed like an
innovation desert is now looking like a flourishing oasis - so much so
that Singapore is being dubbed the "Silicon Valley of Asia". Just last
year alone, 11 Singapore-based startups achieved unicorn status - or
reached US$1 billion valuation - bringing the total number to 22,
according to written reply by Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong
in February. In terms of funding, Singapore recorded 517 deals in the
first nine months of this year, amounting to S$11.35 billion in total,
based on figures from Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG), the
government agency championing enterprise development. The Singapore
ecosystem has not only done better now compared to its past self, but
also when stacked up against global competitors: Singapore came in
seventh in the Global Innovation Index 2022. It was also ranked first in
Asia and seventh globally in Startup Blink's Global Startup Ecosystem
Index 2022. Speaking to TODAY, analysts, venture capitalists and
entrepreneurs acknowledged the role that the Government and its agencies
play in making Singapore more conducive for startups.

But there were bigger factors at play, including the growing affluence
and digitalisation of services in Southeast Asia. "Of course,
Singapore's strategic location at the heart of Southeast Asia cannot be
understated," said Mr Edwin Chow, assistant chief executive officer for
innovation and enterprise at EnterpriseSG, in response to TODAY's
queries. "We are situated in one of the fastest-growing regions - with a
growing middle-class demographic that is increasingly tech-savvy - and
are well-positioned to serve as a launchpad for overseas startups."
Going forward, experts said that Singapore cannot rely on the same
playbook in order to continue growing its startup ecosystem, which
comprises a gamut of different players such as entrepreneurs,
incubators, co-working spaces, investors, government agencies and
universities. This is because rivals are fast catching up and closing
the gap on Singapore, in terms of infrastructure and talent pool, to
name a few factors. To raise its game, Singapore has to produce startups
that can go toe-to-toe with global enterprises, the experts said. LAYING
THE FOUNDATIONS In a report published in June, the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) studied Singapore's tech startup ecosystem. Noting that the
Republic's reputation for nurturing startups "developed only over the
last decade", the report outlined broad factors commonly cited by
stakeholders that make Singapore conducive for such enterprises. "While
some factors such as tax rates, infrastructure, and ease of doing
business help all companies, other factors such as government grants and
the volume of venture capital, are specific to startups," the report
said. Speaking to TODAY, Dr Wong Poh Kam, emeritus professor at the
National University of Singapore (NUS), traced the Republic's efforts to
boost the availability of capital back to April 1999, when the
Government unveiled a US$1 billion Technopreneurship Investment Fund
(TIF) to jumpstart the venture capital industry. Dr Wong, who is a
serial entrepreneur and angel investor himself, noted that in recent
years, Singapore has also attracted many high net worth individuals and
family offices. And this, in turn, draws enterprises here. "For example,
many Vietnamese and Indian startups prefer to set up in Singapore, even
though their markets are in Vietnam or India, because it is easier to
secure investment that way," said Dr Wong, adding that there is also
greater trust in Singapore's legal framework for investment. However,
access to funding is but one part of the equation in creating a vibrant
startup ecosystem. "Alongside this, an educated workforce and a strong
intellectual property protection regime have positioned Singapore as a
hub for entrepreneurs," said Mr Chiu Wu Hong, partner and head of
enterprise and tax at KPMG in Singapore. "The education system is also
another factor that has contributed to the rise, with local universities
ranked among the top in the world and providing entrepreneurship courses
or promoting entrepreneurship," he added. On its part, EnterpriseSG has
adopted a multi-prong approach to support startups based here: Deepening
global connections In 2017, EnterpriseSG launched the Global Innovation
Alliance network to strengthen Singapore's connections to major
innovation hubs around the world. This has paved the way for students,
entrepreneurs and businesses to gain overseas experience and collaborate
with international counterparts. Providing platforms for co-innovation
EnterpriseSG also supports co-innovation programmes, where local
start-ups and small and medium enterprises partner with overseas
companies to work on innovative projects. Strengthening human capital On
the human capital front, EnterpriseSG makes an effort to develop local
talents while at the same time attracting global ones. For example, it
exposes Singaporeans to internships and overseas work opportunities
through its Global Ready Talent programme. At the same time, it
incentivises entrepreneurs and investors to come to Singapore via the
EntrePass, so that they can set up shop here and create businesses and
jobs. EntrePass is granted for one to two years, with passholders
required to create more jobs for locals and increase their business
spending in order to get the pass renewed. Providing financing
opportunities Under EnterpriseSG's Startup SG Equity scheme, it
co-invests in eligible startups with independent, qualified third-party
investors. EnterpriseSG had co-invested over S$51 million into 58
startups in 2021, which in turn attracted S$400m in private sector
investments. Creating infrastructure to support start-ups Under
EnterpriseSG's Startup SG network, startups are also provided spaces to
grow, experiment and flourish, such as the "LaunchPads" in Jurong
Innovation District and one-north. HAS S'PORE'S EFFORTS PAID OFF? Over
time, the government schemes have "resulted in the vibrant startup
ecosystem that we see today, attracting participation from local,
regional as well as global players", said Mr Joongshik Wang, leader for
Asean at EY-Parthenon, the global strategy consulting arm of EY.
Nevertheless, experts interviewed by TODAY offered differing views on
what they felt were the most important benchmarks of success for a
startup ecosystem, and how Singapore has fared based on these factors.
Mr Ku Kay Mok, senior partner of venture capital firm Gobi Partners,
said that the "clearest" and "most objective" indicator of success for a
startup ecosystem is the amount of investment that it can attract.
"Because people are voting with their money. So whether you (really)
have the most top talent, best infrastructure, whatever it is - they'll
vote with their dollars," he said. And while huge economies such as the
United States and China naturally would pull in the big bulk of global
funding, he said Singapore has "captured the lion's share of venture
capital funding in the Southeast Asian region". For Dr Wong of NUS, an
indicator of the vibrancy of a start-up ecosystem is the
"self-sustaining, virtuous (circle) of flow of entrepreneurial talents
and capital in the system". This refers to successful entrepreneurs
becoming investors or mentors to groom the next generation of startups,
or key employees in one generation of successful "scale-ups" leaving to
become entrepreneurs themselves or help grow new early stage startups,
he said. "Scale-ups" refer to startups that have a stable business model
and have proven their viability. Based on this measure, Dr Wong said
that Singapore is "making good progress", though he also pointed out
that the virtuous circle is not yet at the scale of what can be observed
in Silicon Valley in the US. THE SUCCESS STORIES In early October,
Forbes reported that FinAccel had become Singapore's latest unicorn
after raising almost US$140 million in a Series D funding round that
valued the company at US$1.66 billion. FinAccel is the parent company of
Indonesia's buy now, pay later platform Kredivo. While it may not be a
household name among Singaporeans, many would be familiar with other
startups that have achieved unicorn status. These include delivery
company Ninja Van, super-app Grab and Sea, which owns e-commerce site
Shopee. A unicorn status, however, should not be mistaken for financial
stability or viability. For example, Grab is still seeking profitability
while Shopee has reduced its headcount as its parent company seeks to
reduce operational costs. TODAY previously reported that the gloomy
economic climate has brought forward the time of reckoning for disruptor
companies, which are facing pressure to show profitability. Citing the
macroeconomic environment, the experts told TODAY that these
developments do not, in any way, reflect negatively on Singapore's
startup ecosystem. Mr Gerard Lim, partner at Singapore-based accelerator
XS APAC, referred to the prospect of a potential looming recession and
the rise in interest rates around the world. And while it is unfortunate
that some employees had to be retrenched, Dr Wong said it was a small
silver lining for the startup ecosystem. "When some of the bigger tech
companies cut back on (staff strength), it may be good in the sense that
they are releasing some of these technical talents (into the market),"
Dr Wong said. The experiences and know-how of these ex-employees may
then benefit the smaller startups where they are subsequently hired.
Apart from startups that have succeeded in penetrating regional markets,
Singapore is also home to those with a strong global reach such as
PatSnap, a unicorn company which has over 10,000 customers in more than
40 countries. PatSnap - a portmanteau of "patent" and "snap" - uses
artificial intelligence-powered and machine learning technology to comb
through billions of datasets to produce what it calls "innovation
intelligence" to its business clients. According to its website, its
clients include the likes of Walt Disney, Tesla and Dyson. ATTRACTING
ENTREPRENEURS FROM ABROAD Over the years, Singapore has managed to
attract foreign entrepreneurs to set up shop here, including those from
different countries who decided to work together in the Republic to
build their startups - with EnterpriseSG playing the role of matchmaker.
Fairmart Technologies, for example, was set up slightly less than two
years ago by two men from Ukraine and Slovenia. "The EntrePass visa
programme allowed my co-founder and I to both move here during the
pandemic and start a company with minimal fuss," said the firm's CEO Jan
Gasparic, who is Slovenian. He said that he and his business partner
Daniil Moskovtsov, who is Ukrainian, met in Singapore through the
EnterpriseSG-supported incubation programme Entrepreneur First. "We
chose Singapore as it has a more vibrant community, better
infrastructure, and a supportive government," said Mr Gasparic, who came
to Singapore from Hong Kong while Mr Moskovtsov had been in New Zealand
for three years before coming to Singapore. GO REGIONAL OR GLOBAL? At a
media event earlier this month, EnterpriseSG noted that Asia's economic
potential continues to grow, with the region on track to account for 50
per cent of global gross domestic product and drive 40 per cent of
global consumption by 2040. As of last year, there were 277 unicorns in
the Asia-Pacific region, making up more than half of the world's total
unicorns. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia continues to provide a fertile
ground for businesses looking to serve its young and digitally savvy
population. With so much business potential in the region, it is only
natural that some entrepreneurs set up shop in Singapore with the
deliberate intention of tapping this market. "(Daniil) and I found a
common challenge for physical retailers across the region and we were
super excited to solve this in a scalable way," said Mr Gasparic of
Fairmart. "We've grown to 150 stores in Singapore and are now running
pilots in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Philippines to assess our expansion
markets. That's been our plan from the start and we're continuing on
this path." Ms Grace Sai, co-founder of sustainability-focused startup,
Unravel Carbon, said that some startups choose not to scale globally.
"The market size of Southeast Asia or Asia alone is big enough to create
category winning companies. So for some companies, it's never their
strategy to be global," she said. "They want to dominate and serve Asia
very well because of all the knowledge around local nuances." Mr Chiu of
KPMG said that start-ups that operate regionally may be playing to their
strengths, "such as having expert knowledge of local markets and
customer behaviours - thus allowing their businesses to be
hyper-localised - and the ability to successfully adapt their business
model based on a correct identification of market gaps." Lucrative as
the regional market may be, other experts cautioned against riding
solely on the region's growing affluence and digitalisation for the long
haul. Mr Ku said that future growth opportunities, such as Web 3.0 and
deep tech fields such as medtech and healthtech, tend to be "borderless
in nature" and would provide a better opportunity for startups to serve
a bigger, global market. And as regional startup ecosystems develop,
they may possibly chip away at some advantages that Singapore's
ecosystem and its startups have. Citing the likes of Vietnam and
Indonesia, a World Bank report last year noted that Singapore's
neighbouring countries "have created their own startup ecosystems",
thereby increasing the regional competition. "A startup attempting to
scale from Singapore into a neighbouring market will now find more
difficulty than it may have faced in years past," the report added. Dr
Wong reiterated that as neighbouring startup ecosystems mature, more
funds may start to flow there instead of Singapore. "Then why do I, as a
founder, need to come to Singapore to tap the venture capital funds? I
can go directly to the target market," he said. 'MATTER OF TIME' BEFORE
MORE S'PORE STARTUPS MAKE A MARK INTERNATIONALLY Despite the relative
success of Singapore's startup scene, questions have been raised about
the small number of homegrown startups that are able to go toe-to-toe
with international brands. Some experts said that it may just be a
matter of time. "The growth phenomenon within the local startup scene
took place only in recent years and more time may be required for those
with global ambitions to start venturing beyond, especially into
less-known markets," said Mr Chiu of KPMG. Mr Lim of XS APAC added: "A
company like (homegrown startup) Razer has been around for almost 20
years, and we could maybe now call it a global brand." Mr Lim believes
that given more time, many more Singapore startups can go global. People
also need time to gain the necessary experience to scale their
businesses, the experts pointed out. "We have not had (that many)
experienced executives who have built and scaled global teams, global
programmes, global services," said Ms Sai of Unravel Carbon, who
attributed this to the relative nascency of Singapore's startup
ecosystem. "So there's that lack of depth of experience to help these
new generations of companies to do the same - to scale globally and to
serve tens of millions of users." Having said that, some companies go
global from the get-go. "We started venturing out to Europe, the US and
China markets in the very early days," said PatSnap founder and CEO
Jeffrey Tiong. "We serve customers who invest a lot in R and D (research
and development), and the US, Europe and China are the few countries
that have huge R and D expenditure." Mr Tiong added that to go global,
startups need to offer innovative solutions that stand out from the
pack. "If the solution we offer is not especially differentiated, then
it is hard to compete with other players... in the US, Europe, Japan and
China," he said. However, Mr Ku said sometimes, going global might not
require a company to offer cutting-edge solutions. Citing the examples
of Razer and Secretlab, which are both gaming peripheral companies, he
noted that startups can use good marketing to penetrate a niche market
across the globe."For Singapore, it's hard for us to create a mainstream
global success, for example, cell phones. We just don't have a big home
market," he said. CHALLENGES IN TAKING THE NEXT STEP Indeed, the size of
Singapore's market - both in terms of consumers and talent pool - has
often been cited as an intrinsic limitation for growing the startup
ecosystem. The experts reiterated that the small talent pool here may
not be enough to meet the needs of the growing ecosystem. Associate
Professor Marilyn Ang Uy from Nanyang Technological University's Nanyang
Business School, said that compounding this issue is the "relatively
higher salaries in Singapore compared to neighbouring countries", which
would make labour even more costly. Mr Chiu of KPMG added: "Given the
rising inflationary pressure, startups in Singapore may be seeing a
sharp increase in their business costs." Agreeing, EnterpriseSG's Mr
Chow nevertheless noted that such challenges are global in nature,
making investors more prudent when deploying capital. "Startups must
tread carefully to plan their finances and runway, and properly
demonstrate the economics and profitability of their business," he said.
"Only then can they remain competitive and win over today's cautious
investors." Notwithstanding the global economic headwinds, Dr Wong of
NUS noted that most start-ups that have grown rapidly in recent years in
Singapore are those in the internet, mobile, fintech or digital sectors.
"In contrast, Singapore has yet to be able to grow a critical mass of
deep tech startups, and this is to me the biggest challenge that
Singapore will face in further deepening our startup ecosystem," he
said. He cited how PatSnap was able to penetrate the China and US
markets, "because it's not like when they came out, there were many
similar start-ups like them around the world". "Until we are able to
really pioneer our own solution, then we are able to go global," Dr Wong
said. To overcome Singapore's market size limitation, both Mr Ku of Gobi
Partners and Dr Wong stressed the need to tap overseas networks and
collaborations, as well as attract global talents with relevant
experiences to the Republic. Indeed, the Government have been ramping up
efforts on both fronts. The Global Innovation Alliance network that
began with fewer than five "nodes" in 2019, has now expanded to 17
across major innovation centres, including two new ones in Abu Dhabi and
Seoul announced by Mr Gan at the Singapore Week of Innovation and
Technology 2022 Appreciation Dinner earlier this week. Mr Chow said:
"Our international co-innovation programmes also afford local companies
to team up with foreign partners to secure funding for the joint
development and test-bedding of new solutions, before scaling into the
region." He urged entrepreneurs to "have the confidence and be daring to
address global markets and challenges". They should also "take full
advantage of the programmes that we have in place to scale outside of
Singapore, and do so quickly", he added. The bottom line? Entrepreneurs
need to think big - in order to make it big. After all, there was plenty
of scepticism all round when Singapore took the first steps to build a
flourishing startup scene a decade ago.

New Delhi [India], April 5 (ANI): The government has recognised 92,683
entities as startups as on February 28, 2023, since the launch of
Startup India initiative in 2016.

As per eligibility conditions prescribed under notification dated
February 19, 2019, entities were recognised as 'startups' under Startup
India initiative by the Department for Promotion of Industry and
Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the government of India.

The government with an intent to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing
innovation, startups and encouraging private investments in startup
ecosystem of the country launched Startup India initiative on January
16, 2016, according to a statement from the ministry of commerce and
Industry released on Wednesday.

According to the statement, the regular businesses are often measured by
success or failure in a specific number of years of operation, whereas,
the startups and scale-ups (established startups) are more accurately
measured by failure or success in a particular phase making it difficult
to put together a statistic covering all types of new businesses and
their failure rate with any level of accuracy. Therefore, the
information with respect to the success or failure of startups is not
centrally-maintained by the Government, it added.

Startup India initiative was launched on January 16, 2016, with an
objective to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and
startups in the country that would drive sustainable economic growth and
generate large scale employment opportunities.

According to the statement, DPIIT recognised 8,635 startups in 2018, as
many as 11,279 in 2019, as many as 14,498 in 2020, as many as 20,046 in
2021 and 26,542 in 2022. (ANI)

The Passion Economy: Sound advice for start-ups on how the passion
economy works

The Financial Express

In 1850, the best any thinker could contemplate about the nature of work
and society was a person's enslavement to her needs and the machine.
Karl Marx developed a theory of capital on the context how the
capitalist used machines to subdue the labour. The situation was no
different when John Keynes took a similar view of the nature of work and
the rise of machines to replace labour. The jobs of today, he said,
would be a lot different from the jobs of tomorrow. While both were
right in that context, none could ever fathom that passion and work
could ever be the same. The idea still seems absurd to many.

It was a thing of arts and literature and only a few talented could
follow their passions as a profession. This was true of both the 1800s
and the early 1900s. But Joseph Schumpeter provided some romanticism to
the idea of being an entrepreneur, with an indomitable spirit to
succeed. He called entrepreneurs undertaking the task of creative
destruction as passionate people. Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were a
select few who would fall in the category-driven by their passion to
create new worlds.

The passion economy that follows in Adam Davidson's work is no
different. Just that more passionate people are finding work and
following what they wish to do. The Passion Economy is not about
philosophy or about nature of work, but what works in making businesses
work. The author, a journalist, and co-founder of NPR's Planet Money
programme, details the life and history of a few successful start-ups.
But these people are not geniuses, who dropped out of Harvard or had
their family's money; these people belong to working class households.
There are no rags-to-riches tales either.

What Davidson does is carefully analyse each of these enterprises and
the role of passion in the capitalist world. Divided into 12 chapters
and four case studies, it relies heavily on the research of Scott Stern.
Then there are the general rules of how businesses should operate.
Pricing should be as per certain norms, create value that cannot be
copied, never be in the commodity business even if you are selling a
commodity. Passion should be a story. Then there is advice for employees
and the famous theory of nudge.

Sadly, there is nothing new that The Passion Economy offers. It has the
same advice that every entrepreneur or podcast will offer. It is just
that Davidson has rebranded it as the social economy. Plus, Davidson
doesn't offer much in terms of case studies also. The research is,
indeed, well done, and Davidson does present important insights. But
that is a limited domain. The ideas are more repackaged than anything
else.

Passion goes missing from the book and why that passion exists and how
it develops are nowhere to be found. What Davidson also misses is the
fact that commodification has been the truth for the capitalist world,
whether it was then or now. Consumerism is something that a company can
rarely avoid. And, all entrepreneurs are passionate about making money.
The only thing that has changed over the years is that passion has
become a commodity itself. And, as passion is a story, you are doing
nothing but selling passion to get funding, whether that is for yourself
or for a social cause. The book ends up not deliberating on passion, but
how passion has worked in certain situations. There is no talk of
failures. For every passionate start-up that works there are many that
fail. If only passion was enough. Not every passionate worker can get
remuneration in the market. Capitalist forces decide on market dynamics.
In a recession, passion may not even get you a job, but in a boom even
the non-passionate may get rewarded.

The book is for anyone who wants to learn about start-ups and wants
advice not from their uncle but an established author. Davidson does
give a glimpse of his idea of a passion economy; only that it gets
missed in the humdrum.

The impact of overseas human capital and social ties on Chinese returnee
entrepreneurs’ venture performance

ABSTRACT

Purpose

Entrepreneurship research clearly documents the importance of human and
social capital and stresses the way in which entrepreneurs take
advantage of their own social affiliations and network strategies in
pursuit of their entrepreneurial goals, yet the research on returnee
entrepreneurs’ human and social capital is not sufficiently studied in
the international context, in particular when returnees’ overseas human
capital and social capital may be a misfit with local business
environment. Using the data from Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ venture
activities in China, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact
of returnee entrepreneurs’ overseas capital (human and social) and
domestic capital (human and social) on their venture performance in
China, and further explore the interaction effect of different social
and human capital with China’s entrepreneurial environment.

Design/methodology/approach

This study surveyed 500 start-up businesses created by returnee
entrepreneurs in China to collect data. Self-administered questionnaires
were used to collect data on their demographic information, the
information about the human and social capital of these returnee
entrepreneurs, including domestic and overseas capital, various
performance measures, and other control variables ending up with 226
usable questionnaires.

Findings

The results show that Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ overseas human
capital and social capital, as well as their domestic social capital,
but not domestic human capital, have a significant impact on their
venture performance. In addition, while domestic entrepreneurial
environment does not affect the impact of overseas human and social
capital on venture performance, it does provide an important contextual
setting for domestic capital to improve returnee entrepreneurs’ venture
performance.

Originality/value

The findings help enrich the understanding of the dynamic interplays
among Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ domestic human capital and social
capital, overseas human capital, and social capital, as well as the
entrepreneurial environment for returnee entrepreneurs’ success, which
makes an important contribution to the international entrepreneurship
theory by showing that overseas human capital and social capital are not
a misfit with local markets. It also provides empirical support for the
mediating effect of entrepreneurial opportunity identification. The
important role of entrepreneurial opportunity is empirically supported
in an international context: entrepreneurship is all about the discovery
of entrepreneurial opportunities and exploitation of this opportunity to
create viable business entities for new products and services, even in
the Chinese context, a culture which is very different from the ones
where the entrepreneurship theory was developed.

Introduction

The past decades have seen an increased research interest in
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial activities (Davidsson and Honig, 2003;
Gartner, 1985; Kenney et al., 2013), focusing on topics such as economic
benefits of entrepreneurship (Decker et al., 2014), institutional
environment or cultural influences on entrepreneurship (Gupta et al.,
2014; Liu and Almor, 2016; Tolciu, 2011; Zhou et al., 2016), opportunity
identification for entrepreneurial activities (Lindsay and Craig, 2002),
entrepreneurial financing (Fraser et al., 2015; Wu and Ma, 2018), and
international entrepreneurship (Coviello et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012;
Oviatt and McDougall, 1994; Wang et al., 2014; Zahra et al., 2014; Zhou
et al., 2016). While this line of research on entrepreneurship has
generated a large array of literature on entrepreneurs and
entrepreneurship, the knowledge about entrepreneurs who navigate various
obstacles in their entrepreneurial activities remains limited (Amezcua
et al., 2013; Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Li et al., 2012). It is not
very clear why many people who create their own start-ups fail to
achieve their objectives, while others are quite successful (Davidsson
and Honig, 2003), in particular in an international context (Li et al.,
2012).

Contemporary research on entrepreneurship has shown that human capital
and social capital play an important role in entrepreneurial activities
and argue that these endowments affect the rate of entrepreneurial
success (Batjargal, 2007; Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Kwon and Arenius,
2010; Li et al., 2012), yet research on returnee entrepreneurs’ human
capital and social capital and, in particular, how their overseas human
capital and social capital affect returnee entrepreneurs and their
activities in their home countries is relatively scant (Zhou et al.,
2016, 2017). Returnee entrepreneurs usually face disadvantages in social
ties after they spend years working overseas and thus often the lack of
sufficient knowledge about local markets, comparing with those who have
been working locally. Spending years studying or working abroad thus may
put returnee entrepreneurs at a disadvantage in local markets once they
return. Culturally, returnee entrepreneurs may also find it hard to
reintegrate into their home societies, and thus their overseas
experiences might be a misfit with local markets (Wu and Ma, 2018).
Research on returnee entrepreneurs has gradually become an important
issue in the new century because the global market is increasingly
integrated and international entrepreneurial activities are making
important contribution to financial wealth creation (Coviello et al.,
2011; Ma et al., 2013; Zahra et al., 2014). As a result, while research
on human capital and social network of individual entrepreneurs has
yielded valuable insights on entrepreneurship, little is relatively
known about how these different types of capital contributes to returnee
entrepreneurs’ venture creation or firm performance, even less clear
about its impact in the international context (Vanhanocker et al., 2005;
Zweig et al., 2006), especially when returnee entrepreneurs’ human
capital and social capital acquired overseas could be seen as a misfit
with local environment and thus returnee entrepreneurs may be more
likely to fail in starting new businesses in their own countries than
their local counterparts (Wu and Ma, 2018).

Among the research on entrepreneurship in the international context,
research on emerging markets in particular on China →the newly
industrialized economy → has attracted increasing attention (Gupta et
al., 2014). As the Chinese economy is growing at an unprecedented rate,
China has become to be known as the manufacturing center of the world
but it is yet to establish itself as a center of technology-based
companies (Ma et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2008). Recently, the Chinese
Government has beefed up its efforts by creating many talent attraction
plans, including the Changjiang Scholar Program, the Thousand-Talent
Plan, and the National Medium- and Long-term Talent Development Plan
(2010-2020), a blueprint for creating a highly skilled national work
force within the next decade and the first national comprehensive plan
in China’s history on national human resources development (Wang, 2010;
Zweig et al., 2004). The main purpose of these and other similar plans
is to create a conducive environment to attract overseas talents to come
back in order to leverage their technical know-how and entrepreneurial
expertise (Wright et al., 2008) and to facilitate the transition from a
manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-based one (Ma et al.,
2009). However, while it is understandable that a large number of
start-ups created by returnee entrepreneurs have sprung up in China as a
result of these programs (Batjargal, 2007; Wright et al., 2008), it is
not very clear how various talent attraction programs, the overseas
human capital and social capital acquired abroad, and the
entrepreneurial environment the Chinese Government has painstakingly
created actually affects the success of start-ups established by
returnee entrepreneurs (Vanhanocker et al., 2005; Zweig et al., 2004,
2006).

To address such a research gap, this study is intended to explore the
impact of returnee entrepreneurs’ human capital and social capital (both
domestic and overseas) on their start-ups in the Chinese context,
whether Chinese returnees’ overseas human and social capital are a
misfit, and further on whether the positive entrepreneurial environment
created by the Chinese Government actually facilitates the success of
these start-ups. More specifically, this study examines the impact of
returnee entrepreneurs’ domestic human capital and social capital as
well as their overseas human capital and social capital on their
start-ups’ performance in China, and then explores how entrepreneurial
environment in China moderates this process. It is also proposed that
entrepreneurial opportunity discovery mediates the impact of domestic
capital and overseas capital on returnee entrepreneurs’ venture
performance, as often found in similar studies (Davidsson and Honig,
2003; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000; Vanhanocker et al., 2005; Zweig et
al., 2006). This study is different from cultural influence research or
educated returnee arguments (Zhou et al., 2016) in that this study
focuses on returnee entrepreneurs’ human and social capital, both
overseas and domestic, rather than on how culture affects their
entrepreneurial activities after they come back to home countries. This
study is also unique as it examines a question whether talents should
return to their home country for start-ups given their human capital and
social capital accumulated in their host countries. The findings of this
study will be able to help develop more robust theories on
entrepreneurship in China and provide insightful suggestions for
returnee entrepreneurs to improve their chance of success in an
international context.

Conceptual framework and hypotheses

Entrepreneurship research have been a topic of rapidly growing interest
to academics and policymaker for decades (Batjargal, 2007; Davidsson and
Honig, 2003; Li et al., 2012; Liu and Almor, 2016; Zhou et al., 2016,
2017), resulting in an impressive array of literature on entrepreneurs
and their entrepreneurial activities (for a review, please see Frese and
Gielnik, 2014). For example, Shane and Venkataraman (2000) proposed a
conceptual framework on entrepreneurship and argued that
entrepreneurship began with the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunity
by focusing on existence, discovery, and exploitation of opportunities.
They also contended that entrepreneurs’ human capital including
cognitive properties and individual difference as well as their social
capital had a significant impact on the discovery of entrepreneurial
opportunities. Davidsson and Honig (2003) further used longitudinal
empirical data on nascent entrepreneurs’ activities to prove that the
discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities mediated the impact of
nascent entrepreneurs’ human capital and social capital on the success
of start-up companies. Sahlman (1999) developed a four-component model
of entrepreneurship to combine entrepreneur, entrepreneurial
opportunity, external context, and the deal itself, arguing for the
mutual influence among these four elements in that external context
affected the other three dynamic components and at the same time these
three components influenced external context. Christian and Julien
(2001) also emphasized the dynamic interplays among entrepreneurs and
their new businesses with external environment continuously shaping
entrepreneurial activities.

More recent research on entrepreneurship have begun to examine the
returnee entrepreneurs’ activities and their antecedent factors in
various countries as an increasing number of scholars have noted that
global talents are returning to their countries of origin to start new
businesses and thus becoming returnee entrepreneurs (Joseph and Jie,
2014; Kenney et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Liu and Almor, 2016; Zhou et
al., 2016, 2017). In an effort to better understand returnee
entrepreneurs and the determinants of their success in emerging markets,
Pruthi (2014) interviewed 20 start-ups created by returnee entrepreneurs
in India and found that returnee entrepreneurs’ social capital was an
essential factor for the creation and success of these start-ups, in
which returnee entrepreneurs discovered entrepreneurial opportunities
and started new businesses using their social ties with their home
countries and the countries where they had lived or studied. Similarly,
Batjargal (2007) examined 94 internet ventures in Beijing and found that
Chinese entrepreneurs’ social capital and human capital were essential
in determining the performance of internet ventures. Li et al. (2012)
showed that the ownership of technology entrepreneurship in the
Zhongguancun Science Park of China is an important contextual factor for
Chinese new ventures led by returnees. Zhou et al. (2016) demonstrated
that returnees’ general human capital promoted new firm formation.
Kenney et al. (2013) further compared the role of returnee entrepreneurs
in information and communication technology companies in China, India,
and Taiwan, and found that returnee entrepreneurs also played an active
role in the secondary development phase after indigenous entrepreneurs
and policy makers had laid the groundwork for the industry.

Drawing upon the previous research, this study attempts to continue this
line of research by proposing an integrated research model, as described
in Figure 1, to examine the impact of returnee entrepreneurs’ human and
social capital on their venture performance in the Chinese context.
According to this model, returnee entrepreneurs’ overseas human capital
and social capital and their domestic human capital and social capital
all affect their venture performance in China. This relationship is
further mediated by the entrepreneurial opportunity identification, with
entrepreneurial environment moderating this process.

Human capital and venture performance

Entrepreneurship is defined as the identification and exploitation of
business opportunities within the individual-opportunity nexus (Frese
and Gielnik, 2014; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). The human capital
theory maintains that knowledge provides individual entrepreneurs with
increased cognitive abilities to identify and exploiting entrepreneurial
opportunities for more productive and efficient potential activities
(Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Frese and Gielnik, 2014). Human capital as
one important aspect of individual differences was also considered a
significant determinant of entrepreneurial success (Shane and
Venkataraman, 2000; Sharon and Lowell, 2001), and received empirical
support in their significant roles for returnee entrepreneurs to start
new businesses (Batjargal, 2007). Similarly, Davidsson and Honig (2003)
argued that human capital including working experiences and practical
learning acquired on the job and other non-formal education, management
experience, and previous entrepreneurial experience whether they were
acquired overseas or domestically, was all significantly related to
entrepreneurial activities.

Empirical evidence provides support for the positive impact of human
capital on returnee entrepreneurs’ success. For instance, Dai and Liu
(2009) compared the firm performance of 353 small and medium enterprises
created by returnee entrepreneurs and that of 358 home-grown small and
medium enterprises in the high-technology industries in China, and found
that the performance of the former was better than the local SMEs’
performance, wherein international entrepreneurial orientation, number
of patents, R&D investment, overseas knowledge and experiences →
important components of human capital → significantly affect returnee
entrepreneurs’ firm performance. Therefore, it is proposed in this study
that Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ human capital, both domestic and
overseas, will be positively related to their venture performance in
start-ups: H1a. Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ domestic human capital
will be positively related to their venture performance.H1b. Chinese
returnee entrepreneurs’ overseas human capital will be positively
related to their venture performance.

Social capital and venture performance

Returnee entrepreneurs’ social capital refers to their ability to
extract benefits from their social structures, networks, and memberships
(Lin et al., 1981), which can be provided by extended family,
community-based, or organizational relationships, to supplement the
effects of education, experiences, and financial resources (Davidsson
and Honig, 2003). Social capital is believed to play an important role
in entrepreneurial activities (Batjargal, 2007; Davidsson and Honig,
2003; Frese and Gielnik, 2014; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000) because
social networks’ structure presents entrepreneurial opportunities which
may be transformed into profits by entrepreneurs and those entrepreneurs
with strong social networks are more likely to do well by harnessing the
benefits of entrepreneurial opportunities in new sales, supplier
contracts, access to advertising channels, financial capital and
important decisions, as well as participation in joint projects or
partnerships (Batjargal, 2007).

From an entrepreneurial perspective, social capital actually provides
networks that can facilitate the discovery of opportunities, as well as
the identification, collection, and allocation of scarce resources by
assisting with the entrepreneurial exploitation process in providing and
diffusing critical information or resources (Davidsson and Honig, 2003;
Lee and Jones, 2015; Nordstrom and Steier, 2015; Tata and Prasad, 2015).
This could apply to both domestic social network and overseas social
network, with domestic social network providing necessary support,
information, resources, and structured connections from local context to
start a new business and overseas social network providing more unique
international entrepreneurial opportunities such as industry trends,
leading technical and managerial know-how and venture capital investment
for the newly created start-ups, leading to more success in their
entrepreneurial efforts.

In particular, returnee entrepreneurs who studied and worked overseas
are likely to benefit more from their overseas social network because
these entrepreneurs possess superior technology, management, and market
know-how, in addition to their language skills and cross-cultural
experiences. Thus returnee entrepreneurs are more knowledgeable of
diverse resources and effective ways on how and when to collect relevant
information. Language skills also enable returnees to keep track of
latest industry trends and capitalize on brokerage opportunities of
joint ventures, alliances, and venture capital investments (Batjargal,
2007). Empirical evidence was also found in support of the significant
roles of both domestic social capital and overseas social capital for
the success of returnee entrepreneurs in different cultural contexts
(Batjargal, 2007; Kenney et al., 2013; Pruthi, 2014). Therefore, it is
expected in this study that Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ social
capital, both domestic and overseas, will have a positive impact on
their venture performance: H2a. Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ domestic
social capital will be positively related to their venture
performance.H2b. Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ overseas social capital
will be positively related to their venture performance.

Entrepreneurial opportunity and its mediating effect

Entrepreneurial opportunity discovery and identification play a key role
in the success of entrepreneurs (Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Frese and
Gielnik, 2014; Gartner, 1985; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). To start a
new business, you must first have entrepreneurial opportunities.
Entrepreneurial opportunities are the situations where new goods,
services, raw materials, organizational methods can be introduced and
sold at greater than their costs of production (Gartner, 1985; Shane and
Venkataraman, 2000). According to Shane and Venkataraman (2000),
entrepreneurial opportunities differ from the larger set of all
opportunities for profit, particularly opportunities to enhance the
efficiency of existing goods or services because the former require the
discovery of new means-ends relationships, whereas the latter involve
optimization within the existing means-ends frameworks.

Although an opportunity for entrepreneurial profit might exist, the
opportunity itself is not known to all parties at all time and
entrepreneurs can earn this profit only if they recognize the
opportunity exists and has values. Entrepreneurial opportunity
identification is considered an essential step in the entrepreneurial
process before entrepreneurs can create an organizational to convert the
opportunity into a viable product or service (Davidsson and Honig, 2003;
Kwon and Arenius, 2010; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). Therefore, while
entrepreneurs’ human capital and social capital have been found to have
significantly effect on their start-up success, it is argued that the
effect of these endowments is actually mediated by the identification of
entrepreneurial opportunities. In other words, human capital and social
networks will first help the entrepreneurs identify the potential
entrepreneurial opportunity, the situation where they can introduce new
products, services, or organization methods for profits, before
entrepreneurs can start a business to exploit this opportunity to
realize this potential. In their study on nascent entrepreneurs,
Davidsson and Honig (2003) have found that human capital and social
capital are positively associated with entrepreneurial discovery as
indicated by the probability of entering into nascent entrepreneurial
activities first and then associated with creating a viable business
entity to obtain sales and achieve profitability. In this study, it is
hypothesized that entrepreneurial opportunity identification also
mediates the relationship between Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ human
capital and social capital and their venture performance: H3.
Entrepreneurial opportunity identification will mediate the relationship
between Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ human capital and social capital
and their venture performance.

Entrepreneurial environment and its moderating effect

Entrepreneurial environment refers to the combination of external
factors that influence entrepreneurial activities and it defines the
context for entrepreneurs to start and operate a new business (Gartner,
1985; Gupta et al., 2014). The entrepreneurial environment in a country,
comprising formal and informal norms, rules, regulations, and values
regarding entrepreneurial activities governs social and economic
exchanges and thus has a major influence on the rate, nature, and
success of entrepreneurial activities in any society (Gartner, 1985). It
can also substantially shape the pursuit of entrepreneurship and the
likelihood of new venture creation by making certain actions more viable
than others (Gupta et al., 2014). Therefore, there is no surprise that
entrepreneurial environment has proven to be an important contextual
factor that moderates the process of entrepreneurial activities in a
variety of topics on entrepreneurship (Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Kwon
and Arenius, 2010; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000).

The entrepreneurial environment also has an important effect on returnee
entrepreneurs’ decision and further activities in the process of
entrepreneurship (Gupta et al., 2014). The support, including resources
provided by local government and friendliness is an important
consideration in returnee entrepreneurs’ decision to go back for
start-ups. The resources provided by the local government can actually
increase or reduce the chance of success of new start-ups, and the
appropriate entrepreneurial environment is thus critical for
entrepreneurial opportunity discovery and venture investment (Amezcua et
al., 2013; Kwon and Arenius, 2010).

The significant contributions to their economic development brought by
entrepreneurs in many western countries have motivated the Chinese
Government, among many others emerging markets’ government, to create
talent attraction plans, as discussed in the previous sections. Yet it
is still not very clear whether these programs actually have worked in
the past decade. It is expected that creating a conducive
entrepreneurial environment for entrepreneurial activities is the key to
attract more returnees to start a new business locally and further to
retain these returnee entrepreneurs (Saxenian 2005). In this study, it
is proposed that a conducive entrepreneurial environment will positively
moderate the process of entrepreneurial opportunity identification and
exploitation, and further on the sales and profitability and other
venture performance indicators for Chinese returnee entrepreneurs: H4.
The conducive entrepreneurial environment will positively moderate the
impact of Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ human capital and social
capital on their venture performance.

Methods

Data collection

In total, 500 start-ups businesses were contacted for data collection in
this study. They were created by Chinese returnee entrepreneurs in the
city of Wuxi, China. The returnee entrepreneur list was obtained from
the city of Wuxi and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas
Chinese (zhongguo qiaolian) with the help of the Bureau of Human
Resources and Social Security of Wuxi, with a random sample of 500
returnees selected from the list. The city of Wuxi is the Exemplar City
of Returnee Entrepreneurs’ Start-up in China, with a large number of
returnee entrepreneurs and associated start-ups, which makes it one of
the ideal places to examine Chinese returnee entrepreneurs and their
entrepreneurial activities. The contacted start-ups participated in this
study voluntarily by completing a self-administered questionnaire which
asks for the firm’s demographic information, the information about the
human and social capital of returnee entrepreneurs, including domestic
and overseas capital, various performance measures, and other control
variables (please refer to next section). The questions included in the
questionnaire were all simple and self-explanatory and thus no need to
explain the questions to the respondents. With a multi-round follow-ups
for participation that run six month from late 2014 to early 2015 to
encourage these start-ups to complete the questionnaire, 226 usable
questionnaires were completed and returned from the 500 contacted
start-ups, with a response rate of 45.2 percent. All of the respondent
returnees have obtained their education both in China and from abroad.
In total, 217 of the respondent firms were from the high-tech sector,
and the overall average firm age was 4.5 years, with the average firm
size of 40 employees. With respect to returnee entrepreneurs who created
these start-ups, 89.4 percent of them were male, and the average age was
44 years old.

Measures

Scales widely used in previous research were adopted in this study to
assess domestic and overseas capital as well as other predictor and
criterion variables (Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Lindsay and Craig,
2002). Minor adaptation was also made based on pilot tests and focus
group interviews for a better fit with local context.

Returnee entrepreneurs’ domestic and overseas human capitals were
assessed by a number of indicators, similar to what was tested in
previous studies (e.g. Davidsson and Honig, 2003). The respondents were
asked to indicate the highest level of education they had completed in
terms of years (education). The respondents were also asked to indicate
whether they had received any training including classes or workshops on
starting a business (business training), their total year of full time
paid work experience in any field (work experience), their supervisory
or managerial experience in terms of number of years (managerial
experience), as well as their experience of having attempted a start-up
before (start-up experience). The domestic human capital was assessed on
these aspects when they obtained them domestically, and the overseas
human capital was assessed on these aspects when they obtained them
abroad. The resulting high reliability level for these variables
supports the validity of this scale, with a reliability α of 0.81 for
domestic human capital and 0.90 for overseas human capital.

Returnee entrepreneurs’ social capital was assessed using a number of
indicators that capture bonding-bridging or strong ties-weak ties
dimensions, including personal and social networks generated through
family, relatives, friends, trade association, chambers of commerce or
service clubs, government agencies (Davidsson and Honig, 2003), which
are indicators of social ties that may be indicative of bonding social
capital. In addition, two more indicators, including the network
generated through start-up science parks in China, and through supplier
and customer relationships were added to assess the returnee
entrepreneurs’ domestic social network, and three more indicators were
added to assess returnee entrepreneurs’ overseas social network,
including the support from overseas friends for starting a business in
China, the frequency of contacts with overseas friends, and the breadth
of overseas personal network. All of these indicators were answered on
five-point Likert scales, with 1 representing the weakest level of
connection, and 5 the strongest. The resulting reliability αs of 0.88
for overseas social capital and 0.86 for domestic social capital also
support the validity of the scales of social capital.

Entrepreneurial opportunity identification was assessed using a scale
adapted from what was used in previous studies by Ardichvili et al.
(2003), Lindsay and Craig (2002) and Kirzner (1997). With five-point
Likert items, this scale assessed three indicators of entrepreneurial
opportunity identification, including opportunity search → scanning the
environment for possible opportunities while looking for or generating
possible ideas, opportunity recognition → reviewing a situation to
identify whether it is a potential opportunity in broad and general
terms and determining whether this opportunity specifically is an
opportunity for the respondent entrepreneurs, and opportunity evaluation
→ collecting information on the potential opportunity to verify and
decide whether the respondent entrepreneurs will commit funds (Lindsay
and Craig, 2002). The reliability α for this scale was 0.86.

The entrepreneurial environment was measured using the indicators
adapted from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) project. The GEM
project began in 1999 as a joint project between Babson College, USA and
London Business School, UK, with an aim to consider why some countries
are more “entrepreneurial” than others to assess the national context
and how that impacts entrepreneurship. GEM is the richest resource of
information on the subject, publishing a range of global, national, and
“special topic” reports on an annual basis, which allows a deep
understanding of the environment for entrepreneurship and provides
valuable insights. Using the indicator items from GEM, this study
assessed nine different aspects of entrepreneurial environment for the
participant firms, including policies on financial support, government
regulations, policies on government project, policies on education and
training, R&D and technology transfer policies, business environment,
the level of specialized infrastructure, openness of domestic market,
accessibility to general infrastructure, and culture and social norms.
In the questionnaire, participants were asked to assess on a five-point
Likert scale the favorableness of each of the nine dimensions for their
firms in a given industry. The resulting reliability α was 0.94 for this
study.

The criterion variable in this study was venture performance for which
this study used five-point Likert scales adapted from the ones used in
previous studies (Christian and Julien, 2001; Ensley et al., 2002;
Venkatraman and Ramnaujam, 1986) to assess six indicators of the focus
start-ups: average sale growth, average profit growth, employee growth
(in terms of employee numbers), average market share growth, number of
new products, and customer satisfaction. The reliability α was 0.84.

In most studies, gender has been found to be a significant factor in
starting a business, and age has also been found an important factor →
generally speaking, the more individuals approach retirement age, the
less likely they would invest in activities necessary to start a new
business (Davidsson and Honig, 2003). Therefore, this study controls for
the impact of returnee entrepreneurs’ gender and age in this study.

Results

Table I reports means, standard deviations, reliability coefficients,
and correlations among Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ human capital
(domestic and overseas), social capital (domestic and overseas),
entrepreneurial opportunity identification, entrepreneurial environment,
and venture performance. In general, the bivariate correlations reflect
expected relations and provide confidence that the measures functioned
properly for the effects tested in this study.

Main effects

Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted in this study to test the
hypothesized relationships (please refer to Table II). This study first
tested the impact of domestic human capital and overseas human capital
on returnee entrepreneurs’ venture performance, and the results
supported H1b but not H1a (Model 4 in Table II), which suggests that
while human capital have been found an important factor in
entrepreneurship research, domestic human capital does not influence
returnee entrepreneurs’ venture performance in China (H1a not supported,
β=0.04, ns), but overseas human capital including returnee
entrepreneurs’ education, business training, start-up experience, and
managerial experiences obtained before they return to China does play an
important role in their start-up success in China (H1b supported,
β=0.14, p<0.05).

As far as returnee entrepreneurs’ social capital is concerned, the
regression results showed both H2a and H2b were supported (please refer
to Model 4 in Tables II, β=0.17, p<0.05, β=0.16, p<0.05, respectively).
In other words, these entrepreneurs’ social ties, whether they obtained
domestically or from their overseas connections, both have a significant
influence on their success after they started their businesses in China.

Mediating effect

H3 proposes that Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ entrepreneurial
opportunity identification mediates the impact of their human capital
and social capital on their venture performance. To test this mediating
effect, this study followed the standard procedure as prescribed by
Baron and Kenny (1986): this study first tested the impact of
independent variables (human capital and social capital) on dependent
variable (venture performance), for which the significant influence was
confirmed in the previous section. This study then tested the
significant influence of independent variables (human capital and social
capital) on the mediator (entrepreneurial opportunity identification),
which was also confirmed as in Model 2 (β=0.02, ns; β=0.13, p<0.05;
β=0.32, p<0.001; β=0.19, p<0.01 for domestic human capital, overseas
human capital, domestic social capital, and overseas social capital,
respectively). The impact of entrepreneurial opportunity identification
on venture performance was also found significant (Model 5, β=0.65,
p<0.001).

This study further regressed the dependent variable (venture
performance) on both the mediator (entrepreneurial opportunity
identification) and independent variables (human capital and social
capital) as in Model 6. The results showed that the impact of the
mediator on the dependent variable remained significant (β=0.62,
p<0.001) but the impact of independent variables became non-significant.
In other words, maximum evidence for mediation, also called full
mediation, occurred after the inclusion of the mediation variable which
dropped the relationship between the independent variables and dependent
variable to zero. H3 is thus supported and, as predicted, the
entrepreneurial opportunity identification fully mediates the
relationship between returnee entrepreneurs’ human and social capital
and their venture performance in China.

Moderating effect

H4 proposes that China’s entrepreneurial environment moderates the
relationship between returnee entrepreneurs’ human capital and social
capital on their venture performance. To test this hypothesis, the
interaction items were added to the regression as in Model 8 (please
refer to Table II), and the results showed that while entrepreneurial
environment itself had no significant impact on venture performance, it
did moderate the effects of domestic human capital and domestic social
capital on Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ venture success (β=0.19,
p<0.01; β=0.13, p<0.05). Interestingly, it was also found that
entrepreneurial environment did not moderate the impact of Chinese
returnee entrepreneurs’ overseas human capital or social capital on
their venture performance (β=0.05, ns; β=-0.05, ns), partially
supporting H4. This finding indicates that the conducive entrepreneurial
environment in China can strengthen the impact of Chinese returnee
entrepreneurs’ domestic human capital and social capital on their
venture success, but it does not affect the impact of these returnee
entrepreneurs’ overseas human capital or social capital.

Discussion

Contemporary research on entrepreneurship have provided empirical
evidence for the importance of human capital and social capital,
stressing the ways individual entrepreneurs identify the entrepreneurial
opportunity and exploit this opportunity to create viable businesses
(Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Li et al., 2012; Liu and Almor, 2016; Zhou
et al., 2016, 2017). This study began with the fact that relatively less
research on the impact of human capital and social capital has been
conducted on returnee entrepreneurs in an international context, and
even less on Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ success and failure in
start-ups. Returnee entrepreneurs usually face disadvantages in social
ties after they spend years working overseas and thus studying or
working abroad puts returnee entrepreneurs at a disadvantaged position
in local markets once they return. The main research questions of this
study are: RQ1. Whether Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ human capital
and social capital, both those acquired from overseas and those from
domestic, actually help improve venture performance in their start-ups
in China instead of being a misfit in the Chinese market?RQ2. How the
entrepreneurial opportunity identification and entrepreneurial
environment affect this process?

It is expected in this study that returnee entrepreneurs’ human capital
and social capital will positively affect their performance in their
venture companies in China, and within this process, entrepreneurial
opportunity identification will mediate this relationship while
entrepreneurial environment will moderate this relationship.

Empirical data were collected from Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’
start-ups in China, and the results provided empirical support for the
hypothesized relationships. Specifically, Chinese returnee
entrepreneurs’ overseas human capital, their overseas social capital,
and domestic social capital all positively affect their venture
performance in China: the more human capital and social capital they
acquired from overseas, the more likely they will perform better in
their new businesses in China. The more connected they are with domestic
friends, organizations, and other trade unions or associations, the more
likely they will succeed in their venture businesses. These findings are
similar to what were found in other studies (Batjargal, 2007; Davidsson
and Honig, 2003; Li et al., 2012; Liu and Almor, 2016; Zhou et al.,
2016, 2017), which supports the important roles of human capital and
social capital in returnees’ business venture, but this study provides
further support for these findings in an international context → China,
a highly collectivistic society. In addition, this study also finds that
entrepreneurial opportunity identification fully mediates the impact of
domestic capital and overseas capital on returnee entrepreneurs’
performance, which is further moderated by the entrepreneurial
environment in China, again similar to the findings in previous studies
(Batjargal, 2007; Davidsson and Honig, 2003). Furthermore, the business
ventures created by Chinese returnee entrepreneurs are mostly in the
manufacturing-related sectors, with the focus on using advanced
technology to provide solutions to manufacturing firms, a niche market
that often identified by returnee entrepreneurs rather than local
entrepreneurs, thanks to returnees’ overseas human capital and social
capital.

Implications

This study has important implications both in theory and in practice.
Theoretically, the findings of this study can enrich the understanding
of the dynamic interplays among Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ domestic
human capital and social capital, overseas human capital and social
capital, as well as the entrepreneurial environment for returnee
entrepreneurs’ success. This study is thus able to make important
contribution to developing international entrepreneurship theory. It
also provides empirical support for the mediating effect of
entrepreneurial opportunity identification. The important role of
entrepreneurial opportunity is once again supported in an international
context: entrepreneurship is all about the discovery of entrepreneurial
opportunities and exploitation of this opportunity to create viable
business entities for new products and services, even in the Chinese
context, a culture which is so different from the one where the
entrepreneurship theory was developed. The findings of this study are
similar to the ones in previous research (Batjargal, 2007; Davidsson and
Honig, 2003), and thus can help develop a more robust theory on
entrepreneurship by incorporating the findings from the study on
returnee entrepreneurs in the Chinese context.

Moreover, this study indicates that overseas human capital and social
capital seem to be born global in that they can exert important
influence on Chinese returnee entrepreneurs’ start-ups, even in a quite
different cultural context, and this influence seems to be free from the
influence of entrepreneurial environment → the finding of this study
showed that entrepreneurial environment did not moderate the impact of
returnee entrepreneurs’ overseas human capital and social capital. Both
overseas human capital and social capital have an important impact,
independent from entrepreneurial environment. Therefore, it is critical
for entrepreneurs to accumulate as much as possible overseas human
capital, including high education, training, experiences of start-up
creation and start-up operation, and social capital, including seeking
support and building networks with friends, extended families,
organizations, trade unions, and other associations in order to succeed
in starting new businesses locally. Furthermore, the findings of this
study also show that a conducive environment such as easy access to
financial capital, more managerial service, and better infrastructure
will facilitate the success of Chinese returnee entrepreneurs in that it
strengthens the impact of their domestic human capital and social
capital, and thus it is important to consider the influence of
entrepreneurial environment in developing a more integrated theory on
entrepreneurship.

This study will also have important practical implications for
entrepreneurship practitioners and policy makers. First of all, since
overseas human capital and social capital, as well as domestic social
capital all have a positive influence on the success of Chinese returnee
entrepreneurs in China, overseas talents seem to benefit most from their
overseas education and experiences, and are thus encouraged to go back
to start new businesses as their experiences, education, knowledge, and
expertise acquired in the West are valuable assets and can help their
venture in China. Entrepreneurs are also encouraged to acquire more
start-up-related experiences to increase their overseas human capital
and social capital stock and then to take advantage of this endowment to
identify entrepreneurial opportunity in their home countries, to exploit
it, and to convert it into profits by creating new venture entities.

Second, since the conducive entrepreneurial environment positively
affects returnee entrepreneurs’ success, policy makers in China will
benefit from this research and it is worthwhile for the Chinese
Government to invest in creating such an environment in order to attract
and further retain returnees for the transition of a manufacturing-based
economy to an innovation-based economy. This research is even more
important when the Chinese Government is promoting mass innovation and
entrepreneurship as a national policy. Moreover, while overseas human
capital and social capital are free from the influence of the
entrepreneurial environment, returnees’ domestic human capital and
social capital do need to work together with the environment in order to
help returnee entrepreneurs create successful start-ups. This finding
provides empirical support for various talent programs in China. Policy
makers in China should do more to attract returnees, including providing
incentives to come back, and providing with access to financial capital,
managerial service, infrastructure support, and other supportive
measures.

Despite its interesting findings, this study has its limitations. First,
this study is explorative and it only collects the data from one Chinese
city. The applicability of the findings of this study is thus limited.
Cautions should be exercised in applying the findings. Studies using
data from other cities and more different sectors are encouraged. More
cross-cultural studies to include data from other emerging markets such
as other BRICS countries are also helpful to further enrich the
understanding about the impact of overseas human capital and social
capital on returnee entrepreneurs. The way human capital is measured in
this study can also be improved. Human capital is not just experience;
it refers to the skills, knowledge, and other factors that can hardly be
parceled out according to the locations where these elements are
acquired. Future studies should adopt other measures of human capital to
explore the interactions of domestic and overseas human capitals and
their impact on venture performance, as well as how overseas social
capital and human capital interact to improve venture performance. In
addition, this study only explores the existent start-ups, not the ones
that have failed in their early stage or the ones that had failed or
resulted in terminations before they were even created, and thus cannot
answer the questions what human capital or social capital help create
new businesses. Future research is called for to compare the efforts
that lead to successful start-ups and those efforts that attempt to
create start-ups but ending up with failure in order to better help
practitioner and policy makers for more success in start-up ventures.
Moreover, the findings in this study provide support for the important
role of overseas human capital and social capital in returnee
entrepreneurs’ venture performance, and show that entrepreneurial
environment moderates the entrepreneurial process, but we did not
explore the industry difference such as non-high-tech sectors that may
also affect returnees’ venture performance. Future research could do
more field interviews and use longitudinal studies to answer the
specific questions on how and what specific aspects of the
entrepreneurial environment in China affect Chinese returnee
entrepreneurs’ performance.

Firms advised to raise funds from the country's banks

Photo for illustrative purposes only. - KT file

In 2021, venture capitalists invested $38.5 billion in Indian startups.
This has fallen to $25.7 billion in 2022. The global economic downturn
forced investors to go slow on deployment of capital in new age
companies. This particularly affected consumer technology businesses
where the investments went down by 55 per cent to less than $10 billion
in 2022. Big ticket deals of $100 million each dropped to 48 in 2022
from 92 in 2021. This clearly shows that global investors have become
unduly cautious on large ticket deals. This has resulted in some unicorn
startups laying off employees and undertaking cost saving measures. The
problem has to some extent taken a serious turn after the collapse of
two banks in the US. The Indian government has assured over 450 Indian
startups that they would look into their difficulties as a result of the
prevailing global scenario. The Minister for IT & Electronics has
advised Indian startups to rely on funds from the Indian banking sector.
An online link has been provided which would enable these companies to
send their inputs and suggestions. In his opinion, startups which are
able to retrieve their funds from the two banks should open a dollar
account and deposit the funds in Indian banks which operate in the GIFT
City which caters to offshore entities and non-residents.

Currently about 260 million transactions take place everyday using the
Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. This platform, which is
operated by the National Payments Corporation of India, is running three
systems simultaneously so that if there is a problem in one, the other
two can continue operations. The Reserve Bank of India is initiating a
75 digital villages programme. Under this, payment system operators will
adopt 75 villages across the country and convert them into digital
payment-enabled villages. Further, the RBI has launched campaigns to
increase awareness among users so that they do not share confidential
information based on fraudulent messages. The RBI is working with
enforcement authorities to safeguard the interest of the public at
large.

Under section 54-B of the Income-tax Act, capital gains are exempt on
sale of agricultural land if the amount is reinvested in the purchase of
another plot of agricultural land within two years from the date of sale
of the old plot. However, a mandatory condition to be fulfilled is that
the plot of land which is sold should have been used for agricultural
purposes for atleast two years prior to the date of its sale. In other
words, if the land was not cultivated and was left barren during the two
year period prior to sale, the capital gains arising on sale of such
uncultivated land would be liable to tax and the exemption under section
54-B would not be available. Merely because the land that is sold is
classified as agricultural land in the records of the government
authorities would not be sufficient to claim exemption from tax. The tax
authorities and courts in India have insisted that the land should have
been cultivated for at least two years prior to the date of sale so that
the tax exemption can be availed of. Further, the new plot of land
purchased should be retained for three years and also be used for
agricultural purposes.

management laws of India.

CBRE: Co-working only 1.7% of office lease in APAC

Co-working tenants account for a small portion of Asia-Pacific's overall
office leasing market currently but that could change given the
continuing demand for new and flexible office space.

According to a 2019 Asia-Pacific outlook report by Los Angeles-based
property services firm CBRE, flexible space providers, which includes
co-working and serviced office operators, have increased their footprint
by more than 300 percent in Asia-Pacific over the past three years.
However, as things stand, only 1.7 percent of the total prime office
stock in the region is leased to co-working operators at the end of
2018, a modest increase from 1 percent a year before. In comparison,
flexible space providers took up 2.5 percent of both San Francisco's and
Manhattan's overall office occupancy as of early 2018, with the latter
showing a 600 percent growth since 2009.

Going forward, CBRE expects flexible space operators to focus on
improving occupancy levels rather than opening new centers, which could
lead to slower demand-led growth in 2019. As such, the real estate
services firm is advising landlords to differentiate on the basis of
which operators can provide additional services for tenants, such as
landlord-managed meeting and event rooms, for instance.

"Tenants will continue to redefine the usage of office space. Real
estate assets will become more agile. The use of flexible space to
complement core portfolios will be accelerated as tenants respond to the
changing business environment and minimize costs and liabilities," the
report noted.

CBRE expects a trend among traditional tenants, such as boutique
investment firms and advisory firms, to increasingly consider utilizing
co-working leases in prime locations. Other traditional office-occupying
sectors like finance and professional services are also set to focus on
cost-effective office solutions that do not involve significant capital
expenditure, including flight-to-quality relocations.

Meanwhile, tech companies accounted for 24 percent of total office
leasing demand in 2018 due to rapid expansion by major firms along with
new demand from start-ups, making it the sector with the biggest demand
for new or additional space, outside the flexible space sector. In China
and India, especially, government policies aimed at supporting the tech
sector are expected to further drive demand for office space, according
to CBRE. However, the report also advices landlords to be prudent on
configuration of lease contracts due to the high failure rate among
start-ups.

Increasing demand for flexible office space by traditional tenants as
well as start-ups comes at a time of growing supply of office space. New
Grade A office supply in Asia-Pacific is expected to reach a net floor
area over 66 million square feet in 2019, reflecting an increase of 20
percent year-on-year, according to CBRE. A strong driver for this
increase stems from delayed projects, which were originally due for
completion in 2018. For instance, around 10 million square feet of stock
in capital cities like Beijing and Delhi, as well as other Indian tier 1
cities, have been deferred to this year.

Bulk of this new supply will be created in China and India, which
collectively account for 67 percent of stock scheduled for completion
this year. Southeast Asia and the Pacific region will see a limited
volume of new space, and that will be predominantly centered in Jakarta,
Manila, and Melbourne.

From deals and innovations to mass layoffs, 2022 was marked by contrasts

Business Standard

In a year marked by contrasts, the world saw huge deals and innovations;
it also saw mass layoffs in the tech and start-up space, and
administrative failures that impacted firms.

If one man hogged the headlines in 2022, it was Elon Musk. His Twitter
saga and accompanying flip-flops had everyone's attention. The
controversies, agreements, disagreements, and his eventual takeover of
the microblogging site triggered one of the worst layoffs of recent
times. Firms like Meta and Amazon followed suit, with the scale of
firings surpassing the layoffs during the 2008 global slowdown. The year
also saw Musk become the world's richest person, though he's lost that
position in the past few weeks.

In the end, it was over within seconds. Where once stood the Noida twin
towers - the centrepiece of a nine-year-long legal battle - only rubble
remained. The towers - Ceyane (29 floors) and Apex (32 floors) - were
found to be in violation of multiple construction regulations. On August
28, the buildings, which were taller than the Qutub Minar, were
demolished through a 'controlled implosion' via strategically placed
explosives.

In another step towards revolutionising the payments system, the Reserve
Bank of India released the Central Bank Digital Currency, an electronic
version of cash, as a pilot on December 1. To be issued in the same
denominations as paper currency, the e-rupee can be used for retail
transactions. Dubbed as an 'official cryptocurrency' by many, the first
phase covers four cities and four banks - SBI, YES Bank, ICICI Bank and
IDFC First Bank.

FOR AIR INDIA, the year dawned with Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran
meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 27 before the official
handover of the airline. And after nearly seven decades, Air India was
back with the Tata group, which got down to carving out an ambitious
flight path for it. Vistara's merger with Air India was announced. This
would make Air India the second largest player in the domestic market .
AirAsia India's stake from its Malaysian parent was bought. Air India,
meanwhile, posted the best on-time performance among all airlines in
October after years. Aiming to grow its fleet , it's now close to 
placing orders for 500 jetliners. But there have been controversies,
too, with the pilots' associations writing to the top brass about their
punishing schedules and work fatigue.

On October 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi drove a car in Sweden while
in Delhi, courtesy 5G. He also tried other 5G tech while inaugurating
the India Mobile Congress, which ushered in the 5G era - with peak
internet speeds of 10 Gbps compared to 4G's 100 Mbps. To start with,
Reliance Jio and Airtel began providing the services in over a dozen
Indian cities.

FOR FLYERS, THIS  was a turbulent year, with many airlines facing
technical snags - from bird hits to smoke inside the plane. One airline,
SpiceJet, also invited scrutiny by the Directorate General of Civil
Aviation, which directed it to operate only 50 per cent of flights
pending a safety audit.

"As The son grows older, he acquires the father's business; that's all
that is happening," said HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh on April 4 as the
merger of housing financier HDFC Ltd and lender HDFC Bank was announced
in a $40-billion deal. The merger - the biggest in corporate India - is
expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24, subject
to regulatory approvals.

Dubbed India's 'Aramco moment,' the LIC IPO came with big expectations.
Pegged at nearly $2.7 billion, it was India's biggest public issue. The
price band for the initial share sale was set at Rs 902-949. After
listing on the Indian bourses on May 17, its share was trading around Rs
661 on December 23

SHE WAS A member of the team that helped build NSE. But this year Chitra
Ramkrishna, former CEO of NSE, was in the news for her alleged
involvement in the NSE co-location scam. She allegedly took decisions
after discussing official information with "a formless yogi", inviting
penalties from the Sebi, a CBI arrest and an Enforcement Directorate
investigation.

Last year, Ashneer Grover was in the public eye, courtesy Shark Tank
India. This year, he continued to be in the news, first for an abusive
video, and then with BharatPe accusing his family of siphoning off
company funds, charges he denies. He was ousted from the fintech firm
after a public spat. The unicorn also filed an arbitration suit to claw
back Grover's restricted shareholding and founder title.

The world's largest coffee chain, Starbucks, named Indian-origin Laxman
Narasimhan as its next CEO. He will take charge of the firm, which has
nearly 35,000 stores and 383,000 employees, in April 2023. This comes at
a time when Starbucks has seen unionisation efforts and faces inflation
concerns. Naramsimhan was earlier CEO of Reckitt Benckiser and has been
in leadership roles at PepsiCo.

The year saw Gautam Adani on a roll. He overtook Mukesh Ambani to become
the wealthiest Indian in February, and then went on to become the
world's third richest person - the first Asian to hit that spot. Buying
Holcim's cement assets - ACC and Ambuja Cements - for $10.5 billion, he
debuted in the cement space as the second biggest player by capacity. He
also bought 49 per cent stake in Quintillion Media's BQ Prime, and is on
course to own media company NDTV. To cap the year, he also bagged the
tender to give Asia's largest slum, Dharavi, a Rs 5K-crore makeover

F score and burst of barbs from Congress

New Delhi: The Congress greeted the government on its fourth anniversary
with a birthday gift - a booklet titled India betrayed.

As if that wasn't enough, the party also screened a short film
lampooning Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The protagonist in the film, a young girl, whines: " Ya toe videsh yatra
par, ya rally mein (He is either on a foreign tour, or at a public
rally)."

Congress spokesperson Ghulam Nabi Azad said the four years have been a
"saga" of betrayal. " Jhooth bolo, jhagre karao aur sarkar banao (Tell
lies, divide people and form governments)," he told the media conference
where the film was shown and the booklet released.

The party held demonstrations and media conferences across the country
to expose the "betrayal".

The bitterness between the government and the Opposition has doubtless
peaked before the two sides enter the battlefield again in the next few
months. While Congress general secretary Ashok Gehlot described the four
years since May 2014 as the "worst period" since Independence in terms
of peace and social harmony, the party's communications chief, Randeep
Surjewala, accused Modi of ruling with "treachery and tricks".

Congress chief Rahul Gandhi avoided rhetoric and tweeted a report card
instead: "Four Year report card. Agriculture: F, Foreign Policy: F, Fuel
Prices: F, Job Creation: F, Slogan Creation: A+, Self Promotion: A+,
Yoga: B-. Remarks: Master communicator; struggles with complex issues;
short attention span."

The party unleashed all its energy to cry down the joyous celebrations.
While the social media team kept posting graphics and messages to
counter the claims of development, it launched a Twitter campaign called
'KhotiNiyatJhoothaVikas' to run down the BJP's 'SaafNiyatSahiVikas'
drive.

In-house poets came up with multiple rhyming critiques on issues ranging
from agriculture to employment.

The entire focus was on Modi. From national security to foreign affairs,
the Prime Minister was the target; while the BJP was not mentioned at
all, there was no reference to other ministers.

Gehlot said India had never had such a Prime Minister who would publicly
issue threats, saying: " Ye Modi hai, lene ke dene par jayenge (This is
Modi, you will stand to lose, not gain.)"

He added: "Every section is frightened, worried. Can a Prime Minister
strike fear into the citizens?"

Azad said: "Modi made such a hue and cry about corruption. What we saw
is the magic of turning Rs 50,000 into Rs 80 crore by the BJP chief's
son."

The reference was to the turnover of a firm owned by BJP president Amit
Shah's son Jay Shah. A web portal had reported that the turnover had
grown 16,000 times after Modi became Prime Minister, prompting Jay to
file a defamation suit.

Azad added: "They promised to bring back black money and ended up
sending out white money. People's hard earned money - thousands of
crores - were looted by Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi... etc., who fled from
India and that is the government's biggest achievement."

He also pointed out that the number of casualties in Kashmir - both
soldiers and civilians - was the highest during the last three years and
that showed how the government had fared on national security.

"Never before in any period in history, so many terror attacks took
place on military installations under Modi who had exploited the issue
of terrorism to the hilt," Azad said.

The booklet contained statistical details suggesting lowest-ever farm
growth, decline in rural wages and MGNREGA workdays, inadequate minimum
support prices, rising indebtedness of farmers, fraud by insurance
companies and falling exports.

It also dwelt on the alarming job situation, unrest in educational
institutions, paper leaks, inaction in corruption cases, mismanagement
of the economy, profiteering on fuel prices, hostile investment climate,
start-up failures, crimes against women and foreign policy failures.

THE RATING GAME

New Delhi: Congress President Rahul Gandhi's report card on the Modi
govt was without any rhetoric, giving PM Modi at least two A+ for slogan
creation, self-promotion and praise for being a master communicator,
struggles with complex issues; short attention span.

Yes, he gives F to Modi on agriculture, foreign policy, fuel prices and
job creation in a tweet and B- on his pet subject - Yoga.

Congress communication chief Randeep Singh Surjewala tweets 4 Years, 40
Questions and posts several graphics showing promises made and not
fulfilled by the PM. Former union minister Kapil Sibal dwells on Modis
tall talk of Achchhe din with a tweet: There is neither Achchche din nor
sachche din after four years. Mr Modi, we will move forward without you.

The main opposition Congress had a special birthday gift to the govt: A
42-page booklet titled India betrayed. As if this were not rude enough,
it played a short video film at the AICC press conference as well,
lampooning PM Modi for being in perpetual campaign mode and misleading
the nation through false propaganda. The protagonist in the film, a
young girl, whines against Modi: Ya toe videsh yatra par, ya rally mein
(He is either on foreign tour, or at public rally).

The booklet contains statistical details suggesting lowest-ever
agricultural growth, decline in rural wages and MGNREGA workdays,
inadequate MSP, rising indebtedness of farmers, fraud by insurance
companies and falling exports. It also dwells on the alarming job
situation, unrest in educational institutions, paper leaks, inaction in
corruption cases, mismanagement of economy, profiteering on fuel prices,
hostile investment climate, start-up failures, crimes against women,
foreign policy failures and so on.

The party held demonstrations and press conferences across the country
to expose the betrayals. At the press conference, Congress general
secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad stressed that four years have been a saga of
betrayal: Jhooth bolo, jhagre karao aur sarkar banao (Tell lies, divide
people and form governments).

Congress general secretary Ashok Gehlot described the four years as the
worst period since Independence in terms of peace and social harmony,
while Surjewala accused Modi of ruling with treachery and tricks.

In a counter to BJPs ad campaign with the slogan of Saaf Niyat Sahi
Vikas, the Congress social media came up with its own slogan: Khoti
Niyat Jhootha Vikas.

The entire focus of Congress leaders was on the PM; BJP was not
mentioned at all while there was no reference to other ministers. From
national security to foreign affairs, the PM was the target. Gehlot
argued India never had such a PM who would publicly issue threats,
saying: Yeh Modi hai, lene ke dene par jayenge (This is Modi, you will
stand to lose, not gain.) What is this Prime Minister doing? Every
section of society is frightened, worried. Can a Prime Minister strike
fear into the citizens, Gehlot asked.

Azad said: Modi made such a hue and cry about corruption. What we saw is
the magic of BJP chiefs son turning Rs 50,000 into Rs 80 crore. They
promised to bring back black money and ended up sending out white money.
Peoples hard earned money - thousands of crore - were looted by Vijay
Mallya, Nirav Modi, etc who fled from India and that is the Governments
biggest achievement.

Azad also pointed out that the number of casualties in Kashmir - both
soldiers and civilians - were the highest during the last three years
and that showed how this Government fared on national security. Never
before in any period in the history, so many terror attacks took place
on military installations under Modi who had exploited the issue of
terrorism to the hilt, he added.

Why moving fast and pivoting is necessary for startups

e27

August 31, 2019 Saturday 6:06 AM EST

Aug 31, 2019( e27: http://www.e27.sg Delivered by Newstex) Many popular
apps and tools today are results of successful shifts from their
original value propositions Pivoting is no stranger to startups. Nothing
has boggled the brightest minds and entrepreneurs in the scene as much
as pivoting has. By definition, pivoting is the act of shifting business
strategies to find product-market fit[1]. It is also a core concept of
the lean startup methodology[2] which revolves heavily around using a
minimal viable product (MVP) to gauge the market. Changing business
models is inevitable in most.

If not all startups. Twitter started off as a podcast subscription
platform. Slack came from a popular, yet unprofitable video game. Yelp
was an email-based recommendations site before they hit the gold mine
with local business reviews. However, the romanticisation of pivoting
has masked the harsh reality of pivoting and how much it affects
startups if they fail. For every successful pivot, hundreds of other
startups crash and burn. Over 90 per cent of startups fails to meet
their projections[3] while 30-40 per cent lose investors most of their
capital, mainly due to poor demand and unsuccessful pivots. That said,
pivoting is absolutely necessary for startups to succeed. Not a lot of
ideas hit the nail on the head in terms of product-market fit, which is
why founders need to be agile in adapting to the market's reaction. How
can startups determine when to pivot, and how does moving fast help in
making more successful transitions?Is pivoting a good business
strategy?The concern for startups when pivoting is this: is it a
business strategy or a desperate attempt at saving a failing business?
Reacting to the latter scenario will almost always end badly. A study by
CB Insights showed 10 per cent of startups fail due to bad pivots[4],
with 7 per cent citing a failure to pivot as the cause of their demise.
Although failed pivots are not as big of a challenge compared to say,
unmet market needs or running out of cash. It is relevant enough to
bring startups to the ground, which is why pivots must be planned
meticulously instead of being a last-ditch attempt at salvation. Also
Read:3 ways startups should assess different financing options[5] When
done right, pivots are an effective way to tweak business models and
achieve growth opportunities that may have been overlooked or neglected.
Pivoting can also overcome challenges like product validation and
adapting to the market—two of the most common challenges startups face
today[6]. The answer is yes; pivoting is a good business strategy if
founders have a clear idea about why they're pivoting and how they're
going to do it. Treat it as a get-out-of-jail-free card, however, and
the success rate of pivots falls drastically.When should startups
pivot?Finding the 'aha!' moment is a challenge even for experienced
entrepreneurs. For starters, it's hard to determine your startup needs a
shift in its business model. The other tough question to answer is,
where are you pivoting towards? Contrary to popular belief, pivots don't
happen just because the business is failing. Successful, profitable
startups may find reasons to change their model as well if the founders
feel like they've come across a stumbling block. For example, a
VC-backed startup may be clearing a couple of millions a year in profit,
but it's showing zero signs of growth. With pressure from investors[7]
and competitors, the startup may decide to pivot to more profitable
ventures even if it means risking their perfectly stable business. When
to pivot varies greatly between startups, but there are several
guidelines they can use to make more timely transitions.Hitting a
plateau in the marketYou may find yourself stuck in a limbo where it
feels like there's no space left to grow. Your customer base is not
increasing, revenue stays stagnant for a long time, and increased
marketing spends only results in short-term boosts rather than retaining
new customers. In this case, pivoting to a market with the potential for
higher returns is a wise choice. Also Read:The way startups are finding
out if there is a pain point to solve[8] You can continue reaping the
benefits of a stable business, but the point of a startup is to grow,
and you don't achieve that by staying within the plateau.Your core value
proposition is not aligned with your usersPivots often happen when
founders realise users are focusing on an aspect of their product that
is not their core value proposition. It doesn't have to be a misaligned
feature; selling the product differently to what the market needs can
also be a reason to pivot in startups. This was exactly what happened
with IMVU[9] as retold by Eric Ries in his massively popular work, The
Lean Startup. IMVU tried to solve the problem of having too many social
networks by building a platform on top of every social network. An idea
that nearly caused the company to go bust. Ries decided to hold
one-on-one sessions with users to find out what they really wanted from
a platform like IMVU, which slowly paved the way to the social network's
success until today. When founders come across this moment of clarity,
pivoting is, without‌ ‌doubt, the best decision to make.Internal issues
within the teamPaul Graham preaches three cardinal principles in
successful startups[10]: building a product that people want, spending
as little as possible, and having good people to work on the team. As a
startup matures, moments of disagreements and fallout will occur as a
result of different opinions on where and how should the company grow.
Depending on how the matters are resolved[11], founders may find
themselves at a stalemate, which is never a good thing for growth.
Similarly, team members may find themselves being disillusioned and
losing passion for what they're building. No matter how well it's doing,
a startup will never reach the next level if its founders don't wake up
every day to work on the product.'Go slow to go fast' vs 'move fast and
break things'Startups are expected to be nimble in their approach to the
market. This means moving fast in adapting to change, releasing new
features, and catering to user feedback, leading to what is known today
as 'move fast and break things' (MFABT). MFABT encourages rapid
development and pivots in startups by embracing failure. In fact, most
ideas will fail, but it's not a problem as the lessons learned from
failures is valuable enough to offset the losses. The best startups in
the world move at a light speed, which serves an important lesson for
aspiring founders[12]. The quicker you are at executing your ideas, the
higher your chance of success in today's ultra-competitive landscape.How
can startups move fast?Execute your ideas quickly. When a build is done,
ship it to your users and gather feedback. It doesn't have to be
perfect, but it does have to be usable enough for your users, akin to an
MVP but in shipping updates instead. The technology that startups have
access to today is even more of a boost in helping them move fast. Cloud
software, for example, significantly improves the flexibility of
startups by opening up opportunities for teams to work fully online[13],
further echoing the mantra of MFABT. A developer in Seattle can
collaborate with a designer in Bangkok and have their tasks managed and
delivered by a project manager in Bangalore—all with the use of
cloud-based tools. What about 'go slow to go fast'? Isn't it the exact
opposite of what MFABT is? Not exactly. Startups should only go slow at
the beginning when they're finding their footing. Things like
negotiating deals for funding and interviewing customers to understand
their wants and needs must be taken step by step to avoid easily
avoidable mistakes down the road. Also Read:5 lessons I learned from a
startup failure[14]Remember the big pictureEvery aspiring founder dreams
of landing Forbes-worthy VC deals and kicking off their ventures with a
bang. But, it's really easy to lose track of the big picture when you're
approaching for deals left and right without even having a clue of what
your value is to the market.In the beginning, take it slowOnce you've
gotten sufficient customer feedback, take some time to settle on a clear
idea of what your product is and its value to the market. Then, you can
start approaching investors for funding[15]. After you've secured
funding, go full speed ahead. Fortune favours the bold, and for
startups, nothing is more audacious than moving fast and pivoting when
the time is right. - Editor's note:e27publishes relevant guest

Tourism promotion: efforts and failures

The Express Tribune

September 3, 2019 Tuesday

Body

The government is making all efforts to promote tourism in the country.
The Prime Minister is eager to follow in the footsteps of Malaysia, UAE,
and other countries that have successfully promoted tourism and
generated significant revenues. Unfortunately, the ground reality is
that our landscape and topography is being completely ignored. It is
because of this that the dream of promoting tourism may never actualise.

All focus is being concentrated on attracting tourists by easing off
visa requirements. But nothing is being done to introduce a decent and
convenient transport system, into and within the country. Even though
some tourists prefer to explore the culture and visit many different
parts of Karachi, including chaotic and densely populated localities,
most of them prefer the northern areas such as Gilgit, Skardu, Chitral,
Swat, etc. because of the cool weather and beautiful scenery. The
readily available mode of transportation to these places is mostly by
road. In the northern areas, travelling by road during winters is more
of agony due to road closures caused by snow storms and natural
disasters. Tourists and routine commuters are stuck in traffic for
countless hours. In Punjab and Balochistan, travelling by road during
the summers is quite taxing due to harsh climatic conditions and safety
issues on the highways. While tourists are being lured to visit the
scenic sites in Pakistan, no consideration is being given to their
comfortable travel and lodging arrangements. The government's policy of
promoting tourism and generating revenues insures only a small part of
the tourism industry remains working while the industry as a whole is
being ignored. The opposite effect may take place in the future if core
issues aren't addressed instead of setting up cosmetic plans and issuing
farfetched statements.

Keeping in view the diversity in our terrain, the most plausible
solution seems to be greater connectivity and flexible yet affordable
air travel facilities.

In countries which have given attention to tourists, all logistics have
been sorted out first to make sure that tourists don't get stranded,
thereby turning their leisure trip into a nightmare. Pakistan has less
than 40 airliners whereas Vietnam has more than 150 with orders of
another 100 to be imported. Malaysia has over 200 airliners and probably
the biggest private carrier Air Asia, with its subsidiaries in India and
other countries, has acquired long-range Airbus-330s for spreading its
reach, besides having a large number of small airplanes and helicopters
to cover its remote areas.

The visa on arrival, e-visa and an extended stay on visit visa are
undoubtedly steps taken for the ease of tourists. But the question is
how can tourists reach these beautiful sites in a comfortable manner and
according to their travel plans, not bound by the meager travel
facilities being provided to them? During their trips, most have to
alter their travel plans according to the availability of
transportation. Abroad, travel plans are restricted to the availability
of flights being offered by PIA only, since apart from Gulf carriers, no
European or other carrier flies to Pakistan. PIA has already closed down
many of its foreign stations and the in-flight comfort and service being
provided by them is far below the expected standards. Furthermore, if at
all tourists manage to finally reach one of the main stations in
Pakistan an uphill task of commuting domestically will bring a sudden
shock. Domestic flights even between major cities are very limited and
do not provide the flexibility of making travel plans at will. Moreover,
due to the limited availability of seat capacity, fares are sky-high.
There is a gap of around 900 seats per day between the supply and demand
which has caused an escalation in air fares. The prevailing business
situation in the country has also adversely affected the airline
industry. While many airlines have been granted the license to operate a
Regular Public Transport (RPTL) and/or Charter Service, not a single
airline has succeeded in commencing operations, in turn providing better
connectivity between major cities as well as linking them to small
cities. An attempt was also made to introduce the Tourism Promotion and
Regional Integration License (TPRI License) to attract investors to
commence commuter services with small airplanes to operate at small
airfields which are abundantly available in Pakistan. But all efforts
have proven to be in vain and no investor has exhibited interest in
embarking upon such ventures.

The major reasons for the failure of boosting the aviation industry are
the prevailing non-conducive investment climate in the country which is
a separate debate and can be verified from bankers and official
financial indicators; the absence of any commercial aviation
professional in the Ministry of Aviation and the Civil Aviation
Authority. The intricacies of the business can be fully comprehended
only by professionals in the field of commercial aviation. As a
corollary, convenient commuting facilities for tourists are non-existent
and very expensive, even for domestic travellers.

If the government is serious in promoting tourism in the country then it
needs to first take measures to establish an extensive air travel
network which will enable convenience, flexibility, and affordability
for tourists as well as locals. It will only be possible by re-visiting
the policies by appointing key persons in the Ministry of Aviation and
the Civil Aviation Authority on merit and experience. Such persons
definitely need to have extensive hands-on experience in the field of
commercial aviation. Also, by attracting private investors to invest in
the aviation industry, which is a highly capital intensive industry, it
will provide surety that they will not be harassed by any agency or
department. Recently, monetary incentives have been provided to attract
investors towards aviation but a cold response has been witnessed since
it is not only the monetary benefits which matter but a major role is
played by the regulatory authority CAA which unfortunately is not
conducive towards entrepreneurs aspiring to start up an airline. Failure
to enable the establishment of a new airline or revive the bankrupt
Shaheen Air bears testimony to faulty policies and practices. The
condition of allowing only a less-than-40-seater airplane for Charter
Operations is a proof of naivety since there is no airliner which has a
seating capacity of below 40. Bringing in a small 8-10-seater airplane
is neither commercially nor economically viable given the huge costs
involved in setting up the infrastructure. Without seeking professional
guidance and expertise in the field of commercial aviation, the
government will keep trying to find a needle in a hay stack and continue
wondering about its failure in promoting tourism.

Delivered by Newstex)

Popular business reality show, Shark Tank India season 2, has been
garnering a lot of attention lately, courtesy of the contestants'
interesting pitches and the judges' reactions to them. Among all the
contestants, it was Flatheads, a homegrown premium footwear startup
company, that grabbed the eyeballs the most. The co-founder of
Flatheads, Ganesh Balakrishnan, during his appearance on the show,
revealed that his company wason the verge of shuttering,but he was left
disappointed as the sharks asked him to close his business.

Ganesh Balakrishnan'swife, Anuradha Pasupathy shares her side of the
story

Balakrishnan broke down on the show, giving the episodean emotional turn
and grabbingmany eyeballs. As a result, Flatheadssold out their
entireinventory soon after the episode got aired. Now,Balakrishnan's
wife, Anuradha Pasupathy, took to her Linkedin handle and narrated her
side of the story. In her post, Anuradha shared that she earns and her
husband spends, as she threw some light on the hardships that she faced
so that her husband's business could thrive. She penned:

"Main kamati hun, wo udata hai- I am Ganesh Balakrishnan's wife, and
this is my side of his story. When Ganesh decided to leave his corporate
job and start up on his own, I had my own apprehensions about how this
will work. 'It is very difficult to do a startup in India, it needs a
very strong, resilient mind. Coming from a very conventional family,
will he be able to deal with the rigours of entrepreneurship? There are
plenty of wolves out there, will being an honest lamb really work?'."

Anuradha was impressed by the USP of Flatheads

However, despite all the doubts, Anuradha never lost hope in her
husband, Ganesh. Mentioning that Ganeshis a fighter, the doting wife
revealed thatafter a couple of failures in early startups, they finally
settled for Flatheads. But then came the pandemic, which somehow didn't
affect their business. She added:

"But even with all these doubts, I still had belief in him. He is a
fighter, who is determined to make a dent in the universe. The belief
slowly started becoming stronger when Momoe exited to ShopClues, and
later when he started up Flatheads. I was really kicked by the USP of
Flatheads - ultra-lightweight and breathable shoes with natural
materials."

Anuradha recalls whenher resilience was tested as Flatheads started to
stumble

However, Anuradha was hurt when her husband, Ganesh received a
rejection, one after the other,and her resilience was tested when
Flatheads started to stumble. Moreover, looking at the stacks of unsold
inventory boxesinside their house, made her wonderhow much longer did
they needto endure. However, she still tried her best to bring
positivity into their lives through her little efforts. Reflecting on
the same, Anuradha wrote:

"It really hurt when I used to listen to Ganesh and Utkarsh pitching to
investors and hearing one rejection after another. I tried my level best
to bring some positivity into the little time we spent together as a
family. The last phase of Flatheads when we decided to wind down
operations was very painful. We brought shoes home from the warehouse,
and I used to stare at the cartons in our bedroom blocking our pathway.
How much more do we need to endure?"

Ganesh Balakrishnan's wife, Anuradha's reaction to Shark Tank India
episode

Anuradha mentioned that as a techie in Bangalore, she could have opted
for betterpaying jobs or other international career options.However, she
chose stability over ambition andmade a conscious choice to takecare of
the family as Ganesh pursued his dream. Revealing her reaction after
watching theShark Tank episode, Anuradha stated that she didn't cry
because she was stronger now. In her words:

"Throughout this journey, as a techie in Bangalore, I could have chosen
a better paying job or even explored international career options. But I
chose stability over ambition. It was a choice I made to take care of
the family as Ganesh pursued his dream. When we watched the Shark Tank
episode, I didn't cry. Because all these hardships have only made me
stronger and more determined myself, and I know this is just another
storm that we can sail through despite the odds. Bring it on!"

Ganesh Balakrishnan's personal life

For the unversed, Ganesh Balakrishnan isan IIT Bombay alumnus and an MBA
graduate, who started his company, Flatheads, in 2019. While he did well
during the pandemic, his business is currently going through a difficult
phase. During his appearance on Shark Tank India, Ganeshwas offered a
job by Anupam Mittal, but he did not accept the offer as he wished to
focus on his business. On the other hand, his wife,Anuradha Pasupathy,
who's from Bengaluru, is a senior manager at Continental, a
Hanover-based IT firm. The couple is blessed with a daughter and is
currently living their best life together.

What are your thoughts about the struggling life of Ganesh Balakrishnan
and his wife, Anuradha's revelation? Let us know.

Easy money never helps startups find success, says Piyush Goyal

2022 ET STARTUP AWARDS

Bengaluru: Capital will not determine the success or failure of any
startup, and easy money never helps, said Union minister for commerce
and industries Piyush Goyal at the 2022 Economic Times Startup Awards
held in Bengaluru on Saturday. “A tight-fisted tough time is always good
for a startup to come up with innovative ideas with better thought
processes and affordable solutions to our day-to-day problems. While
international companies are talking about lay-offs, Indian startups are
offering to hire them.

In these tough times the world is facing, there are opportunities we
should not miss,” Goyal said. He added that though China had a head
start, India is catching up faster than other economies. “The gov-
ernmen t is looking at $2 trillion worth of exports of services and
goods by 2030, and by 2047 it should touch $6-$7 trillion,” he said.
Union minister for railways and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw said that startups
have a key role to play in ushering in what he called 'New India' and
exhorted them to come up with solutions that help improve the lives of
people living in remote and underserviced areas of the country. “Many
problems may not have an immediate commercial or business model, but
those are the problems that will really make a big difference. Startu ps
today should put their minds to work on problems that affect the tribal
women in Jharkhand, the people living in the northeast, or the remote
areas of Ladakh. Startups should think of those people and come up with
solutions that will make a significant difference in their lives.”
Vaishnaw also said that by Diwali of next year, 5G coverage should be
widespread across India and that this will open up a plethora of
capabilities for startups. India will also soon have a new generation of
railway stations, ones that are designed with user experience in mind,
the Union minister added. These stations will be modelled along the
lines of a city centre and will incorporate each cit y's unique culture
and heritage into its architectural design.

For founders in their tough journeys ahead, YourStory offers a valuable
resource: reviews of 12 useful books on how to interpret, bounce back,
and guard against failures.

Launched in 2012, YourStory's Book Review section features over 355
titles on innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and digital media.
This selection of 12 Books on Failure offers a wealth of advice for
innovators and leaders on how to frame and interpret failure, cope with
the shock, bounce back, and capture useful lessons to guard against
future failures.

News of mistakes rarely makes it to the press, but fortunately, there
are conferences like FailCon that help entrepreneurs analyse failure.
See also my articles on Eight lessons in failure from Amani Institute's
Fail FaireandExit Plan B: Where is your parachute? 15 tips for winding
down your startup.

See our annual pick of Top Quotes on Failure from 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Check out these titles below, and click through to see our full book
reviews. Browse through our author interview section as well, for more
in-depth insights into entrepreneurship and resilience.

The Rebuilders: Going from Setback to Comeback in Business and Beyond,by
Sara Tate and Anna Vogt

Each chapter in this must-read book is divided into four sections: myth,
truth, tool, and story. The authors draw insights from Google, NHS,
World Economic Forum, and experts from the fields of advertising,
sports, and even human rights. The material is written in an engaging
format, and backed by 18 pages of references and sources. See our full
review here.

Fail-Safe Startup,by Tom Eisenmann

The book shares in-depth examples of failures of seven startups for
reasons like the false promise (misplaced confidence from early
success), false start (premature launch), and audacious goals
(unsuccessful moonshots). It offers tips such as be persistent (but be
willing to pivot), be passionate (but not overconfident), grow (but
sustainably), and be scrappy (but don't compromise on skills, quality,
ethics). See the book review here.

The Other "F" Word: How Smart Leaders, Teams and Entrepreneurs Put
Failure to Work, by John Danner and Mark Coopersmith

The core of this book is a seven-stage framework on how to harness
failure, called the Failure Value Cycle: respect, rehearse, recognise,
react, reflect, rebound, and remember. The authors argue that failure
can actually be harnessed as a source of strategic advantage by
startups, provided leaders adopt the right perspective and create the
right kind of culture. See our book review here.

Who Blunders and How: The Dumb Side of the Corporate World, by Robin
Banerjee

With numerous examples and frameworks, this author compellingly shows
that there is a lot to learn from mistakes, failures, blunders, errors,
lapses, traps, snags, bad judgment, mistiming, malpractice, deceit,
fraud, and foibles as well. Forewarned is forearmed, and the lessons of
hindsight and research can help avoid failures on your part as well, and
prevent the destruction or erosion of value. See my book review here.

Adapt: Why Success Always Starts With Failure,by Tim Harford

This book explains how disruptive innovation and political complexity
are creating a fast-changing and often confusing world. From startups to
governments, a mindset of experimentation and coping with failure is key
for long-term success. The content spans business, finance, politics,
biology, arts, neuroscience, and even military history, and is an
entertaining and informative read. See my book review here.

The Up Side of Down: Why Failing Well Is the Key to Success,by Megan
McArdle

The 10 chapters in the 300-page book cover corporate scandals, movie
flops, industry failures, financial crises, hospital errors, experts'
mistakes, education flaws, and even penal law. The material draws on
studies by economists, psychologists and anthropologists. Effective
people fail early, often, cheaply, gracefully, and even heroically. See
my book review here.

The Wisdom of Failure: How to Learn the Tough Leadership Lessons Without
Paying the Price,by Laurence Weinzimmer and Jim McConoughey

This book offers a useful classification of the different kinds of
organisational and leadership failures. The case studies, learnings and
recommendations are based on a seven-year study of what almost 1,000
managers across 21 industries really think about lessons from failures.
See our book review here.

Fail Better: Design Smart Mistakes and Succeed Sooner, by Anjali Sastry
and Kara Penn

The co-authors of this book explain that failures need to be seen as
stepping stones to success, and fail-safe approaches and stories need to
be shared with a wider audience. The book takes principles from
scientific methods, lean startup management and agile software
development, and generalises them to a broader audience. See my book
review here.

Fail Fast or Win Big: The Startup Plan for Starting Now, by Bernhard
Schroeder

This book draws on failure tips from four components of the author's
lean framework: business models, lean resources, rapid prototyping and
customer truth. Founders can learn faster and pivot to new options, thus
reducing the risk of outright failure. The author draws on his marketing
experience for brands such as Yahoo, Apple and Amazon. See my book
review here.

Failing to Succeed: The Story of India's First E-commerce Company,by K.
Vaitheeswaran

This book describes why and how the founder-author had to shut down his
e-commerce venture due to a number of reasons. It offers valuable
lessons and takeaways from the ups and downs of his emotional journey.
"When the going gets tough, what's terrible gets worse," he describes.
"Positivity at all times is a key ingredient for any entrepreneur," he
adds. Read our book review here.

The Biography of a Failed Venture: Decoding Success Secrets from the
Blackbox of a Dead Startup,by Prashant Desai

The roller-coaster journey of Indian shoe brand D:FY is well-captured in
this compelling case-study book. It captures the entrepreneur's personal
and professional journey across five phrases, catchily described in '5
Ds' - desire, dream, dare, determination, and defeat. "There is fame
when one succeeds, failure is shamed," the author laments. See our book
review here.

True North: Leading Authentically in Today's Workplace (Emerging Leader

The authors chart the growth of leadership in three phases: preparation,
peak, and generativity. They advise aspiring leaders to reflect on the
highs and lows of their lives, reframe failures as learning experiences,
reflect on the calling that adversity presents, and avoid ethical drift.
"Although it's relatively easier to rebound from a business failure,
it's considerably harder to recover from a significant character
failure," the authors caution. See our book review here.

Branson's Space Nightmare: Learning from Virgin Orbit's Collapse for

Analyzing the Bankruptcy of Richard Branson's Space Venture: Nine
Failures & Valuable Lessons for Startups in a Competitive Market

The bankruptcy of Richard Branson's $3.7 billion SPAC, Virgin Orbit,
offers critical lessons for startups and entrepreneurs. In a two-year
span, the company transformed from a promising satellite launch business
to a "space nightmare" due to several significant missteps. By examining
these failures, entrepreneurs can avoid making similar mistakes and
chart a smarter course for their own ventures.

Failure Highlights:

1 .Lack of Leadership Experience: The appointment of Dan Hart, an
experienced big company VP, led to management issues as he struggled to
navigate the challenges of a cash-strapped startup.

2. Late Entry in a Competitive Market: While developing its technology,
Virgin Orbit fell behind competitors SpaceX and RocketLab, which had
already successfully launched numerous small satellites.

3. Over-reliance on Complex Technology: Virgin Orbit's horizontal launch
design, utilising a modified 747 with a rocket strapped to it, added
unnecessary complexity and risk to its operations.

4. First Launch Failure: Unlike SpaceX, which overcame early setbacks as
a first-mover, Virgin Orbit's initial launch failure exposed flaws in
its design and engineering.

5. Premature SPAC Announcement: After only two successful launches and
minimal revenue, Virgin Orbit succumbed to market hype and announced a
SPAC, instead of waiting for the right moment.

6. Mismanagement of SPAC: As the SPAC bubble burst, Virgin Orbit raised
only $228 million of its targeted $483 million, leading to financial
constraints.

7. Going Public Too Soon: With insignificant revenues, Virgin Orbit
struggled as a public company and faced skepticism from investors.

8. Subsequent Launch Failure: Virgin Orbit's most recent launch failure
resulted in the loss of all 10 satellites on board, further tarnishing
its reputation.

9. Failure to Secure Funding: As a last resort, Virgin Orbit laid off
85% of its staff in March, but ultimately failed to obtain the necessary
financing to continue operations.

Key Lessons for Startups and Entrepreneurs:

* Choose the right leadership: Appoint a leader with relevant experience
in managing the specific challenges faced by startups, such as cash flow
management, lean operations, and rapid growth.

* Time market entry strategically: Analyse the competitive landscape and
identify the right moment to enter the market. Avoid launching too late,
as catching up with well-established competitors can be challenging.

* Simplify technology: Focus on developing practical and efficient
solutions rather than overly complex or unproven technologies. Simpler
technologies often result in lower costs and reduced risk.

* Learn from failure: When faced with setbacks, analyse the root causes
and apply the lessons learned to improve future performance. Accept that
failure is part of the entrepreneurial journey, but strive for
continuous improvement.

* Avoid market hype: Be cautious about getting caught up in market hype
or pursuing financial opportunities before achieving a stable and
scalable business model. Focus on building a strong foundation before
seeking external investments.

* Secure stable financing: Plan for realistic financing needs,
considering potential market fluctuations and changing investor
sentiment. Aim to raise sufficient funds to sustain your business
through its growth phase.

* Be prepared for going public: Ensure your business has a solid revenue
stream and growth potential before going public. Consider the additional
scrutiny and reporting requirements that come with being a public
company.

* Manage reputation: Carefully plan and execute high-stakes operations
to maintain a positive reputation in the industry. A damaged reputation
can make it difficult to secure future partnerships or funding.

* Be persistent in securing funding: Explore all possible avenues for
financing, including venture capital, government grants, and strategic
partnerships. Be prepared to adjust your business plan and demonstrate
your resilience to potential investors.

By learning from Virgin Orbit's mistakes, startups and entrepreneurs can
make better decisions and mitigate risks on their path to success.

9 things every entrepreneur needs to know before starting their business

Thinking to start your on business? Not sure if you are on the right
track? Need guidance with where to start? Too many questions in mind but
no one to answer them?

Starting a business is never easy, nobody ever said it was going to be
easy and nobody ever will dare to do so because whoever has been there,
knows that ups and downs are sure to come your way. It will be a rough
passage but you ought to be ready to catch those stones and build a
bridge out of it.

Below are a few things you shall know and keep in mind when starting a
new business.

1. Don't Fear Failures!

As a startup, you need to know that you will most likely fail.

Yep, you heard that right! Initially, whatever your business is, it is
going to fail. The idea behind telling you this is not to demotivate
you, NO! It is to prepare you for what is about to come your way. If we
check the statistics, history stands witness; all businesses will go
down the hill. The finances will crumple and the people who swore to
stand by you will leave. But you know what? That is the thing about
'Success', it never comes easy. The first failure, my friend, is a sign
that you're on your way towards success.

2. Know the Legalities!

Every locality has its own legalities that you must know prior to
starting your business. You should know about the taxes that apply to
you and your business, the registration process and the licenses you
would need. In fact, the best of all is to hire a lawyer for yourself.
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, at least take their advice and
ask them the basic legal requirements for a start-up. There are no
losses bigger than the ones you find yourself in after failing to comply
the legalities.

3. Have a well-sought Brand Name

A brand name is how people will recognize you, thus, the name has to
make sense. You cannot name your brand "Carrot" and sell clothes there.
When we think of Carrot, we think of food, not clothes. A brand name
shall articulate with what your business is about. Instead of jotting
down a million names, selecting a few and then deciding which one to go
for, simply choose the best business name from websites that can help.
Not will it just make your life easier but will also give you a catchy
brand name promptly.

4. Know your Economy!

Before starting, it is always a wise idea to know your surroundings. For
a start-up, those surroundings are the current economy, the locality and
the bills and other expenses you are likely to expect. That way you know
what pricing strategy to set and know how much capital you are going to
need.

5. Business is all about Competition

Remember having studied in Economics in the 10th standard that "Business
is all about Competition". It is time to modify it a little bit!
"Business is all about staying in the Competition". Within the first 5
years, your business will decline to a level where it will finally bite
the dust, but you have to remain in the competition. Go slow, or even
drag yourself, but just STAY IN THE COMPETITION. When I say, "Stay in
the Competition", I mean "Never Give Up". Even when your business is
practically at its lowest, everyone leaves you and your competitors
start to think they're one competitor down and stop worrying about you,
work hard in silence.

6. Evaluate and Re-evaluate your Idea!

Your idea has to be unique enough to capture your customer's attention
and retain it. It has to be fresh and it must never go out of fashion.
When I say, "never go out of fashion", I mean it should always remain in
demand. You must know a bit of economics for that matter. Investing in
food, for instance, is a very good idea as it will never go out of
fashion. As long as there are humans, there will be hunger and the need
for good food to fulfil that hunger.

7. Create your "www"

Owning a site today is compulsory as a medium to converse with your
audience. That is where you reach out to people and tell them what you
are all about. Get an IP address for your business and manage the site's
portfolio. Remember, your site is the first impression of your business
on a potential customer so make sure to leave a good one!

8. Try and be AN ALL-ROUNDER!

Initially, you won't have a huge capital to work with, so you have to
work around with what you already have. To cut down on additional costs,
try and be an all-rounder business person. Don't just own the company,
try to manage the people, finance and other resources, as far as
possible, all by yourself. Market your brand yourself. You can always
take help from your family and friends. Once you have enough capital to
work with, go ahead and hire more people.

Many businesses close down simply because the bosses weren't able to pay
their employees and I'm sure you don't want that. Do you?

9. Customers are never easy!

"You can't just ask the customers what they want and then try to give
that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new."

- Steve Jobs.

There is this thing with time, it never remains constant. The same goes
for the Consumer Behaviour, it keeps changing. You might as well monitor
the factors that cause that change but according to a marketer, the
Consumer Behaviour can never be interpreted to a 100%. The maximum a
marketer has ever achieved is 67.5%, with 32.5% of consumers changing
their minds for reasons unknown.

These are a few pointers to consider before you choose to start your
business and they cannot be overlooked. Some of these will keep you
going while some of them will make sure you do not have to close down
because of things like "legalities, a recurrent idea, and not knowing
what to expect". The things mentioned above have all caused troubles for
the newbies of the corporate world, so we hope they won't become an
obstacle for you.

Let us know in the comments below regarding what you think is the most
important of all these when starting a business?

WATCH: This Coimbatore-based incubator wants to Cultiv8 an ecosystem to
help early-stage startups grow

Yourstory.in

July 2, 2019 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST

Cultiv8 wants to grow an ecosystem that helps early-stage startups
flourish. In this video interview with YourStory Business Editor Vishal
Krishna, the Coimbatore-based incubator's Kaarthick Balakrishnan and
Seshadri Krishnan delve into their latest initiative: a six-month
accelerator.

India's startup ecosystem may be booming, but there remains a
significant gap between early-stage companies and investors/industry,
especially in Tier II and III towns. That's why incubators are vital,
feels Kaarthick Balakrishnan, the CEO of Cultiv8, a Coimbatore-based
incubator sponsored by the Indian government's Department of Science and
Technology.

"I have seen great ideas, but without an ecosystem there is no way an
idea can be discovered and shaped to succeed," says Kaarthick
Balakrishnan, the CEO of Cultiv8.

Kaarthick, who has completed a PhD, started as a lecturer in 2004, in
Coimbatore, and eventually set up a company that works with the defence
industry. In 2015, he had been an entrepreneur for almost a decade, and
that's when an idea of starting a new company struck him.

"I had met so many students and entrepreneurs. All asked me basic
questions on how to start up and how to build a business. That's when I
heard through a friend about the government's support to business
incubators, and it clicked," Kaarthick says.

What young startups need

India has as many as 80 technology business incubators (TBUs), with
IIM-A being the most successful. But not all of them are as lucky.
Kaarthick travelled across India and met at least 15 technology business
incubators and began to study why they were not scaling up. Most had
received grants and were able to set up the infrastructure, but were not
able to scale the ideas of startups. Majority of the incubators he
connected with "did not have business connections and therefore the
failure rate of startups was high".

Kaarthick applied to the Department of Science and Technology, and got a
call to present his business case to the Chairman of the National
Entrepreneurship Board in Mumbai. "I kept the idea simple. I just told
them how I was going to run a profitable incubator," he says.

The profitable incubator, as envisaged by him, would have:

* connections to industry

* a professional services ecosystem to kick-start a company

* a R&D service unit

* a co-working space

"I think they liked the fact that I had come there without any
expectation and presented them with a very reasonable plan," Kaarthick
recalls.

He had, by then, convinced the Coimbatore Institute of Engineering and
Technology (CIET) that they had to set up a TBU. The institute believed
that a TBU association would translate into jobs and internships to
their students. And Cultiv8 was born.

Connecting startups and industry

The government initially gave Rs 2.5 crore to set up Cultiv8, and
subsequently offered a grant of Rs 10 crore. Of the 35 companies that
have been a part of the incubator over the last three years, 20 have
been seed funded while three have gone to pre-Series A. The funding in
each startup is anything between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1 crore.

The incubator also raised Rs 2.7 crore from angel investors in
Coimbatore, and has tie-ups with 200 industry partners to provide
startups with much-needed industry partnerships.

Cultiv8 also offers a co-working space for any company wanting to expand
in to Coimbatore. It offers R&D services through CIET for software
companies and startups wanting to test or build software.

In May this year, it launched an accelerator programme, where companies
will be taught how to scale up. The initiative will focus on
growth-oriented activities, and will include ecosystem outreach,
funding, and assistance for stages beyond market validation. Eleven
startups have been selected for the six-month accelerator, including
AngoHealth, AskArvi, Fasal, NeoEyeD, Syntellect, Towno, and Yottasvs.

"If startups have to succeed in the country you cannot have bureaucratic
processes. They need speed to market and mentoring to handle scale,"
says Seshadri Krishnan, Mentor at Cultiv8.

Cultiv8 is on its way to becoming self-sustainable once its startups
raise additional funding rounds. This startup from Coimbatore wants to
make startups from Bharat succeed with technology-led business models.
Seeding businesses that will reap rich rewards, it's no wonder they call
themselves Cultiv8.

6 strange learnings from my failed startup... and how they helped me
start my new venture

Every entrepreneur starts out with the idea of creating disruption. But
very often, the startup runs into failure. The founder of a failed
startup lists out his key learnings and how they help him start up
again.

Ever since I returned from Stanford in 2009, I've been obsessed with the
idea of creating something big, something disruptive, something that
will change the world.

I started my career within my family business where I took my brand new
business unit from 0 to $20 million annual revenues. However, I wasn't
satisfied. I quit that to start Truckola, a tech platform for logistics,
with Keshav and Vipul, my two co-founders.

After four years of a roller-coaster ride with tremendous highs and the
lowest lows, our company ran out of money during the lockdown. Now, I'm
here to share my learnings and discoveries.

Strange learning #1: You can't change the world with a better product!

A great company cannot be built on adjectives like better, cheaper,
faster, prettier, etc. You must create something new, something that
hasn't been seen by your target customer before.

When you do something "better", you're inadvertently activating all the
fears and pains of your customers with their existing solutions and
associating them with yours.

Be different; tell a new story.

Strange learning #2: You can't change the world with a great product
either... unless enough potential customers know how great it is!

Once you have a phenomenal new story, you also need your target
customers to hear about it. A great product is nothing without a
workable distribution channel.

Some of the largest companies in the world - Amazon, Google, Facebook,
Netflix, and Walmart - are those that are merely distribution channels
for other people's products. It's equally important to start testing
your distribution models, as it is to test your products, right from the
inception of your company.

Don't assume that customers will come just because you have built
something amazing!

Strange Learning #3: Don't get friend-zoned by your potential investors!

Raising funds is like dating. You have to be available ("single"), they
have to be available, you need a trusted introduction with them, you
don't want rumours about you to precede your meeting, and you don't want
to be friend-zoned!

At Truckola, we had everything - the perfect team, the "better" product,
smashing metrics. But.. we pitched to too many investors too many times
without doing diligence of whether they were the right fit (in terms of
their sectorial interest, quantum of money they typically invest, and
their culture), without getting proper introductions, and until our
story lost its freshness.

Yeah, it doesn't work. Meet investors, keep them warm, let them know
what's going on in the company, and pitch when you have the sense that
they're now "available" for you.

The more you chase investors, the faster they run away from you!

Strange learning #4: There's only one way to know your true worth... and
to destroy all competition!

The only way to know your true worth is to continually aspire to charge
your customers as high as you can. This doesn't mean that you overprice
your product. This just means that you deliver the highest value
possible for your customers and then charge them as high as they will
pay for that value.

If your customers really care for what you're doing for them, they will
continue to pay you even in the face of stiff competition. If they
don't, it means that you're overestimating their pains or your own
solutions. Either way, you would know your true worth.

The problem with being cheap is that people don't appreciate things that
are free or cheap. As soon as someone undercuts you, your customer
switches away, and you can be sure that you're now on the fastest route
to bankruptcy.

What's the one thing you want to be known for? Being the best.

Strange Learning #5: The only way to bulldoze your operational
issues...is via explosive growth!

At Truckola, we decided that we wanted to differentiate ourselves by
having robust processes, zero failures, and the highest operational
level efficiencies. We spent a year working on this, and we did achieve
it. We had the industry leading operational metrics, with amazing
profitability, cashflows, and other financial numbers. But, what did we
lose in this process?

Say my costs, are Rs 100, and revenues are Rs 140. If we get everything
perfect, we may be able to reduce costs by about 10 percent in a year
(without pay cuts or loss of revenue), which will increase my profits
from Rs 40 to Rs 50. However, if we put the same efforts in sales, we
may increase revenues multiple times, thereby increasing the profits
multiple times as well. Thus, it is far better to spend
disproportionately higher efforts in sales than in operations.

It's better to tolerate operational inefficiencies rather than
compromise on sales.

Strange Learning #6: The only metric that matters in a growing company
is this...

If you just have to focus on one metric in your company, it would be the
ratio of LTV (lifetime value of customers) and CAC (customer acquisition
cost). However, the challenge with these numbers is that they're not
very straightforward to calculate. We had a very high LTV/CAC ratio at
Truckola but on retrospective introspection, the numbers were not
scalable.

An entrepreneur must pay careful attention to this number with all
honesty, and without bias, to determine whether the number would stick
as the company scales. Is your customer acquisition cost artificially
low because customers were acquired due to past relationships of your
sales team, some fluke growth hack, deep discounts, or something else
that will not scale? Are you making reasonable assumptions about your
LTV?

Make your LTV/CAC ratio your one thing, and a lot of things will fall
into place!

So these are my six key learnings I used to start my new venture,
Raising Superstars. We are creating a world-class, never-seen-before
product for parents of young babies.

We started just as a two-member team, and within the second month
itself, using these learnings, we are already clocking monthly revenues
in excess of my entire year's earnings at Truckola.

I wish I had the right mentors when I started up the first time, and
I've thus made it my personal mission to help out as many young
entrepreneurs as I can as they enter the world of startups and
entrepreneurship.

Starting up at Sonic speed: Chiratae Ventures announces new initiative
to fastrack seed funding for early-stage startups

For businesses - especially ones that are just getting off the ground -
capital is the oxygen that keeps them moving. In 2019 estimates suggest
the failure rate of startups stood at a whopping 90 percent.

For many up and coming startups with high potential, one of the key
reasons for their failure was the lack of funds. To solve this issue is
what moved Chiratae Ventures to launch their new initiative: Chiratae
Sonic.

Commenting on the launch of this initiative, Sudhir Sethi, Founder &
Chairman, said, "One of the biggest challenges an early-stage
entrepreneur faces is the tedious and time consuming process behind
raising capital. We believe innovation needs to be at the core of why
and how founders interact with investors. By solving and simplifying the
'how' of that conversation Chiratae Sonic strives to empower founders to
focus on innovation above all."

Keeping this vision in mind, Chiratae Sonic is a landmark seed funding
initiative that aims to level the field for founders seeking seed
funding less than or equal to $500,000. The Venture Capital firm looks
to fuel and fast track the journey of startups by committing to a
48-hour turnaround time.

This initiative will be launched in phases - the first of which went
live on July, 7, 2021. This initiative is the eighth seed investment
program rolled out by Chiratae Ventures to encourage and foster the
growth of early-stage ventures.

Diligence and Rapid Investments: Chiratae Venture's commitment to
early-stage startups

In line with streamlining the path for early-stage founders, through
this initiative, Chiratae Ventures commits to making rapid investment
decisions on standard terms for equity investments. In addition, due
diligence will be carried out rapidly and remotely for all investments
under the programme with trusted partners.

Chiratae Sonic seeks to empower startups with technology at their core,
across dynamic industries, including:

* Consumer Tech

* Enterprise Tech/ SaaS

* FinTech

* Health-Tech

* Deep-Tech

* Ed-Tech

* Agri-Tech

Empowering early-stage startups beyond capital

In addition to much-needed capital, Chiratae Ventures also offers its
portfolio businesses access to the business savvy, insights, and
expertise of its Global Advisory Board and India Advisory Council.
Members of the Global Advisory board include:

Ratan Tata -Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons

Kris Gopalakrishnan - Co-founder of Infosys

Bruno E. Raschle - Founder, Managing Director, and Non-Executive Vice
Chairman of Schroder

Manish Choksi - Non- Executive Vice Chairman of Asian Paints

Dr. Andreas Hettich - Chair, Hettich Group Advisory Board

Dr. Ferzaan Engineer - Co-founder and Chairman of Cytecare Hospitals
(from the India Advisory Council of Chiratae)

Furthermore, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a key collaborator in the
Sonic program, and will offer credits up to $100,000 per eligible
startup through the AWS Activate program, which provides resources like
AWS credits, business mentorship, and technical support to help
early-stage founders build and scale successful businesses.

Days after the failure of US startup-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank
(SVB), Indian technology startups - some of which have been impacted by
the sudden collapse of the bank - have got a positive message from the
government.  Union Minister of State for Electronics & Information
Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar held a

virtual meeting with startups

and assured that the government is focused on helping them navigate
through the situation. The meeting was held with at least 400 startups
in the wake of

SVB's

 shutdown last week.  He also emphasised that startups should start
relying on the country's banking system. "The Indian banking system is
trusted and robust and startups must start using it, " he said.

During the hour-long discussion, Indian startups said they managed to
withdraw their deposits stuck in Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) accounts
after US authorities announced support measures to limit the fallout.
Chandrasekhar also said both the IT and finance ministry are working on
a formula to ensure Indian startups do not feel any liquidity crunch. 
He further added that the government will look to shield startups from
any such closures in future."The finance ministry and RBI will be
looking at policies to shield startups from any such closures in
future," he said.  While SVB's closure initially triggered panic among
tech-focused startups around the world, emergency measures announced by
US authorities allowed depositors to access their fund.  This provided
huge relief to organisations (mainly startups) who had parked more than
$250,000 with SVB.

ET STARTUP AWARDS 2022

Bengaluru: Capital will not determine the success or failure of any
startup, and easy money never helps, said Union minister for commerce
and industry Piyush Goyal at the Economic T imes Startup Awards 2022
held in Bengaluru on Saturday. “A tight-fisted tough time is always good
for a startup to come up with innovative ideas with better thought
processes and afford able solutions to our day-to-day problems. While
international companies are talking about layoffs, Indian startups are
offering to hire them.

In these tough times the world is facing, ther e are opportunities we
should not miss,” Goyal said. He added that though China had a head
start, India is catching up faster than other economies. “The gov-
ernment is looking at $2-trillion worth of exports of services and goods
by 2030, and by 2047 it should touch $6-7 trillion,” he said. Union
minister for railways and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw said that st artups have a
key role to play in ushering in what he called a 'New India' and
exhorted them to come up with solutions that help improve the lives of
people living in remote and underservi ced areas of the country. “Many
problems may not have an immediate commercial or business model, but
those are the problems that will really make a big difference. Startups
today should put the ir minds to work on problems that affect the tribal
women in Jharkhand, the people living in the northeast, or the remote
areas of Ladakh. Startups should think of those people and co me up with
solutions that will make a significant difference in their lives.”
Vaishnaw also said that by Diwali of next year, 5G coverage should be
widesprea d across India and that this will open up a plethora of
capabilities for startups. India will also soon have a new generation of
railway stations, ones that are designed with user experience in mind,
the Union minister added. These stations will be modelled along the
lines of a city centre and will incorporate each city's unique cultur e
and heritage into its architectural design.

Bengaluru: Capital will not determine the success or failure of any
startup, and easy money never helps, said Union minister for commerce
and industry Piyush Goyal at the Economic T imes Startup Awards 2022
held in Bengaluru on Saturday. “A tight-fisted tough time is always good
for a startup to come up with innovative ideas with better thought
processes and afford able solutions to our day-to-day problems. While
international companies are talking about layoffs, Indian startups are
offering to hire them.

In these tough times the world is facing, ther e are opportunities we
should not miss,” Goyal said. He added that though China had a head
start, India is catching up faster than other economies. “The gov-
ernment is looking at $2-trillion worth of exports of services and goods
by 2030, and by 2047 it should touch $6-7 trillion,” he said. Union

Failure as a prologue to success

GM's EV1 and the Tata Nano were commercial failures. But they spawned
numerous creative designs globally A new era is upon us when society,
governments and the auto industry all now seem convinced that the future
of automobiles belongs to electric vehicles (EVs).

A technologist who is familiar with Gartner's hype cycle of innovation
will acknowledge that this credence could have been bestowed only after
a trial by fire, when people behind the technology and related
innovations would have traversed the highs of showcasing revolutionary
breakthroughs inevitably followed by the lows of numerous failures in
honing promising ideas into practical use for society.

In celebration of its 25th anniversary this past week, several industry
news feeds offered paeans to General Motors' EV1 - the first saleable
electric vehicle offered by a large automaker. A milestone in the
evolution of EVs and a true clean-sheet design, it was a product that
benefited from the considerable technical might that the GM of 1990s
possessed.

Recognising that a fully-charged battery in the EV1 contained the energy
equivalent of one gallon of gasoline, every attempt to improve
mechanical efficiency was employed. High efficiency three-phase AC
induction motors, specially crafted low-rolling resistance tyres, and a
novel heat-pump in the place of a conventional air-conditioning system
were all innovations employed to eke out a few more miles from that
meagre store of energy.

EV1, ahead of its time As a young aerodynamicist at GM Research at the
time, I recall the effort taken to deliver a streamlined body with a
drag coefficient of 0.19 - a standard that still remains elusive to
contemporary products. A modern Tesla Model S, acclaimed as the world's
most aerodynamic car clocks in at 0.21. Sadly, as one more product that
was ahead of its time, GM scrapped the EV1 after less than 1,200
vehicles were made. To many, this was another example of profligacy at
GM.

Any retrospective look at the EV1 would do little more than massage
bruised egos if it failed to recognise the implications of the EV1 and
its impact on the subsequent evolution of EV technology. In reality, the
disbanded teams would resurface in many geographies and out of the ashes
of the EV1 deliver new products that would become part of modern EV
landscape.

The propulsion team went on to Allison and became well established
suppliers to many EV bus fleets around the world. Heat-pumps in the
climate control systems are now more frequently employed in modern EVs.
Some of the motor and controller teams relocated to California where
their systems were embraced by Tesla. Tesla's chairman, Elon Musk has
often acknowledged the motivation that GM's sad decision to scrap the
pioneering EV1 provided for him personally.

In India too, we have witnessed a similar journey.

Nano's journey In March 2009, when Ratan Tata launched the Tata Nano, it
was seen as a breakthrough product aimed at serving the mobility needs
of the common man at a previously unmatched price. It gained for India
credibility as a global source for cost-innovation in engineering.

Contrary to the notions of rustic engineering associated with the
epithet "jugaad", both the Tata Nano and the Tata Ace were conceived
with an engineering philosophy that emphasised intelligent minimalism.
Pursuit of minimalism was a goal that motivated many of auto industry's
great designers. Soichiro Honda's mantra was "man-maximum,
machine-minimum".

Alec Issigonis designed the iconic Mini which revolutionised small car
packaging. And Dante Giacosa's elegant engineering created post-war
Italy's affordable people's car - the Cinquecento. Their approach to
design is best described by Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of IKEA, who
said, "To design a desk which may cost $1,000 is easy for a furniture
designer, but to design a functional and good desk which shall cost only
$50 can only be done by the very best."

Yet, like GM's EV1, Tata's Nano was also sadly a commercial failure.

Yet, from its ashes too numerous creative designs have spawned and been
applied globally. I recall a conversation with Gordon Murray, one of
Formula-1's prominent designers of that era. The Nano, he averred,
opened his eyes to a new angle of creativity.

"I have spent my career delighting in shaving tenths of kilograms off my
race-car designs. So, I can well imagine the exhilaration of
intelligently shaving tenths of dollars off the cost of a product".
Murray then went on to develop a new range of innovative small cars that
could be produced with very low investment.

The Indian element More importantly, the erstwhile Chairman of the
Renault-Nissan Alliance, Carlos Ghosn, was a believer in the Nano
philosophy. With his patronage, the Renault-Nissan Alliance adopted the
bold decision that their entry-level global platform CMF-A would be
developed not in Paris or Tokyo as would have been normal, but in India.

That this platform was conceived in Chennai, with a healthy complement
of ex-Tata staff from the Nano project, and developed with a mostly
Indian team is a ringing endorsement of the talent and skills of Indian
engineers in cost-innovation.

Apart from the Kwid that restored Renault's market share in India, newer
platform variants like the Nissan Magnite and the Renault Kiger have
lowered the entry price of Crossovers for many Indian middle-class
families. And now as Renault prepares to offer France's lowest cost EV
in that market, it will be the Dacia Spring - also built off the Indian
origin CMF-A platform.

In a world now familiar with the dynamics of start-ups, the term failure
is not perceived as terminal condemnation but rather as a description of
a temporary state. After all, the collective endeavours of motivated
employees and entrepreneurs can seldom result in outcomes that are
useless. Failure, they say, is not the opposite of success but rather an
important component of success.

The poet Arthur Clough would say, "Say not the Struggle nought Availeth"

The writer is Chairman of Celeris Technologies and the author of
"Faster, Smarter, Greener: the future of the Car and Urban Mobility"

Great People Manager Study for Startups Launched in Association with IIT
Bombay

NewsVoir

September 25, 2019 Wednesday

Length: 546 words

Dateline: Maharashtra

Body

Maharashtra, Sept. 25 -- A nationwide study conducting evaluation of
people managerial effectiveness in start-ups and entrepreneurs has been
launched by Great Manager Institute in association with the
Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Bombay. Great Manager Institute (GMI) runs
the Great People Manager Study where it evaluates thousands of companies
and its managers, in a bid to find the best companies with great people
managers and individual great people managers. This Study for Startups
shall be a subset of the same.

GMI Team at the Launch of the Study

Research report shows that 90% of startups in India fail within 5 years
of their inception, while around 6000 new startups come up every year.
There is no clear reason attributed to the failure of startups, though
separate studies show lack of sustainable innovation or lack of team
bonding as some of the top reasons of failure.

Ashwin Srivastava, Global Investor and Co-founder of Great Manager
Institute, shares his views on the same, In my experience of working
with major venture capitalists across India, I found a common pattern in
most startups that fail after receiving investments. Most of these
companies show a problem in growing at the right pace and with the right
plan once the team expansion begins. People Management issues lead to
disintegration and unsustainable growth.

Kritika Pugalia, Client Engagement Manager and lead for the Great People
Manager Study for Startups, adds, Major VCs and Investors now consider
people management abilities of the entrepreneurs and the founding team
before investing. Therefore, people management should be in focus right
at the ideation stage of a startup. Hence, we decided to partner with E
Cell IIT Bombay and work towards creating sustainable companies out of
young startups, even at ideation stage, by helping them evaluate their
people managerial effectiveness, free of cost. The startups that cross
our threshold will receive a huge valuation boost through a strong media
plan involving a feature in Forbes India.

Eureka is the business model competition by the Entrepreneurship Cell
IIT Bombay and is supporting the Study. Aayushi Agrawal, Media Manager
for Eureka says about this partnership, Eureka aims to develop viable
startups out of disruptive ideas. We do so by helping the teams develop
a business model canvas, a proof of concept, with the help of various
workshops and mentoring by leaders in the industry, over a time span of
5 months. Great People Manager Study is a step in the same direction,
helping these startups build a sustainable business that respects people
relationships, and help them reach out to a larger audience.

Great People Manager Study 2019, the parent study for this program, led
to recognition of top 100 Great People Managers across the country along
with a list of Companies that nurture great people managers. The winners
were honoured by Forbes India and included names such as Satish
Sundaresan of Elektrobit India, Gagan Jyot of RMSI, Miguel Munoz of
Mahindra Holidays, Dilipkumar Khandelwal, then with SAP India, among
others.
