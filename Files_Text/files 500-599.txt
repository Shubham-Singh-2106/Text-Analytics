Mumbai CST bridge collapse: An engineering failure coupled with
irresponsible audit led to the tragedy

Merinews (India)

March 19, 2019 Tuesday

India, March 19 -- One more 'foot over bridge' near CST Railway station
in Mumbai collapsed on 14th March 2019 taking six lives and injuring 32
people. It was said that the traffic signal had turned red just before
the collapse. That's a coincidence else the fatalities could have been
extremely high.

Why a RCC slab/girder collapses? I had written about it in detail in my
article 'Mumbai Foot-over Bridge Collapse-The concerned engineers must
be booked for gross negligence' published in this platform on 03.07.2018
post the partial collapse of the Andheri FOB. In the conclusion too, I
had mentioned that '

The present FOB is known to have been constructed forty years ago. But
the reason remains the same. I have seen some of the photographs. They
clearly show that its reinforcements were exposed which were hidden by
applying a plastering coat. When reinforcements get exposed to the
atmosphere, they get corroded.

Mumbai is situated beside the sea. Thus, its climate is a 'severe' zone
for corrosion. Once corroded, it goes on corroding even if you hide it
with plastering, concrete or by whatever means. Corrosion means that the
reinforcements lose their property to take care of tensile load. In the
effect of corrosion it swells and thus creates cracks (micro) in the
surrounding concrete. Concrete is very week in taking care of tensile
load. A slab or a girder essential a tension member, thus whenever it is
exposed to the atmosphere it starts weakening leading up to failure
irrespective of its age.

I heard that there was audit and the report said that this particular
bridge required minor repairs. Let me reiterate that there is nothing
called minor or major repair. It requires replacement only. The basic
structure of the FOB is made of steel structures. Thus, the concrete
slab needs to be replaced. That's the only viable option. I don't
question the wisdom of the auditor, but my experience says that if an
auditor says that such bridges can be rectified through minor repairs, I
completely disagree.

Such bridges need to be blocked for passenger movement. If passenger
movement is very urgent then necessary support below the slabs (to
reduce the span) should be provided to increase the life before
replacement work begins. This can be considered as a repair just for
some time period. Providing support is very easy in such FOBs. Just weld
some steel members below the slab joining it with the main steel truss.

I once again recommend that audits must be carried out by reputed
institutions like 'Institution of Engineers' or 'Indian Road Congress'
or else such incidents shall keep on occurring. Politics will always be
there. But the Maharashtra CM must refer this matter to such
institutions to avoid more mishaps. This is an engineering failure and
engineers of the respective departments are fully responsible.

Note: The author has more than 30 years of experience in the
construction sector especially in execution and rehabilitation of
bridges.

YourStory UNCUT: Vinay Singhal's on losing a Rs 300 Cr startup and
building STAGE

Body

YourStory UNCUT aims to explore the biggest challenges and failures
startups and entrepreneurs have faced in their journeys. Today, Vinay
Singhal of STAGE talks about his journey of building and losing a
business and starting up again.

Started in 2014 by Vinay Singhal, Shashank Vaishav, and Praveen Singhal,
viral content website WittyFeed was India's answer to American company
BuzzFeed.

In an interaction with YourStory, Vinay revealed that by the end of
2016, the website had recorded 120 million unique month-on-month users.
Additionally, it generated 420 million page views and 2.5 billion
impressions.

But on November 26, 2018, the team woke up to a nightmare. The WittyFeed
Facebook page was wiped off.

"We got killed overnight without any particular reason by Facebook. As
founders, we were in denialwe thought it was a glitch. Later, we were
ready to fight Facebook. But as time passed, we realised that wasn't
going to happen," says Vinay.

By February 2019, the team ran out of money and was about to shut shop.
"But we somehow believed that this cannot be the climax of our storyWe
had to rebuild and rethink what we do from here," he adds.

Later that year, Vinay, Shashank, and Praveen set out to build a Netflix
for Bharat-STAGE, an artist and dialect-based OTT platform for Indians.
Today, the hyperlocal video entertainment platform has recorded more
than two million downloads and has over one lakh paying customers.

It is backed by the likes of Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Ritesh Malik, Blume
Ventures, Venture Catalysts, and Inflection Point Ventures.

"Our team kept saying that they won't give up, no matter what. And that
became the origin story of STAGE," says Vinay.

For this episode on YourStory UNCUT, Vinay takes us through his journey
of losing his first company, almost shutting shop, and building STAGE.

It takes a team

Before the deletion of WittyFeed's official page, the personal Facebook
profiles of the founders were deleted from the social media platform.
The 150 employees working at the company also had their work experience
removed from the platform as well.

"We may have violated some policies but we were never informed about
itat these companies, you do not get to talk to humans. You only talk to
an email address at best," says Vinay.

WittyFeed was profitable. But soon after its death, the team ran out of
money.

The founding team called for a town hall with 90 employees remaining and
laid out two options. They could either shut down that very day or the
team could trust the founder and stick with them for another six months.

To their surprise, 54 people decided to stay back, taking home only 25
percent of their salary. Double of the remaining 75 percent was given as
equity.

Vinay says, "These 54 employees became our angel investors, came to the
cap table, and rescued us while we figured out the journey onward."

"How do you kill a company that refuses to die?" he laughs.

The pivot

OTT platforms in India- both global and large Indian players-focus on
languages in the name of vernacular content. That is, they make video
content in languages like Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi.

However, "The moment you go beyond urban settlements in India, everybody
speaks a dialectLanguage is an urban concept," explains Vinay.

Growing up speaking in Haryanvi led him and his co-founders to think
about why there wasn't any content available in the dialect. "A true
hyperlocal company built for Bharat would be a dialect-based platform.
That is what STAGE is," he adds.

Currently, only building content in Haryanvi, STAGE aims to target the
underserved markets of India.

The founders at STAGE

Road to STAGE

While building STAGE, the team essentially faced three major challenges.

"We are more of a category creator. There are no TV channels or OTT
platforms in this industry from which we could learn from," says Vinay.

First, the team had to prove that there was actually an audience willing
to consume content in local dialects. Vinay says that the first
18-months post the inception of the company went into solving this
demand problem.

Once it was established that people were willing to consume content in
local languages, the startup had to tackle the supply problem. To solve
this, STAGE started a production house from scratch, making the very
first web series in Haryanvi.

Finally, the last roadblock was monetising the content. "There is more
money in rural India than we give credit for. All we had to do was
create value for that," Vinay says. Last April, STAGE went from being a
fully-free platform to a fully-paid platform, and since then, it has
added more than one lakh paying customers.

Overcoming 500 rejections

While the team had credibility in the market due to the success of
WittyFeed, production is no cakewalk. "To build an OTT platform, you
need to heavily invest to produce movies and web series. You need to
pump crores to build just one good web series," Vinay says.

Thus, STAGE needed to raise more external funding and it did not come
easy.

The most prevalent model was building a user-generated content
application, similar to TikTok or Instagram or YouTube.

"We were trying to build something newThere was no parallel to our story
in the US or China. So, it became very difficult for investors to
understand the model," Vinay explains. "Anybody who wants to invest in
our business has to spend an incredible amount of time understanding our
business."

"The funny thing about investors is that they want you to build
something unique and once you do so, it becomes difficult for them to
invest in you because you are 'out of thesis' and a category creator,"
he says.

Convincing VCs to invest in STAGE became another battle. The founding
team reached out to the top 25 investors and made more than 100
pitches-and got rejected. In fact, STAGE had to go through 500
rejections before five investors believed in the story.

The startup's first angel investor was Jana Balasubramaniam, who came
through Venture Catalysts. While Jana did not attend the pitch, he
reached out to the team after watching the recorded video and decided to
lead the round for his firm. He continues to remain the single largest
angel investor on STAGE's cap table.

"Blume (Ventures) rejected the first pitch as well," Vinay says. The
conversation with Blume continued for over a year before the early-stage
VC came on board, and Vinay attributes this to the immense patience
Karthik Reddy possesses.

Another of the first investors in STAGE is Better Capital. The startup
has raised Rs 30.75 crore in funding so far.

Final word

Advising aspiring and early-stage entrepreneurs, Vinay says, "Keep at
it. Do not give up. Persist and negotiate your way out of the struggles.
Anyone who has built a successful business had to struggle at one point.
They have reached the top because they persisted."

The entrepreneur says it does get lonely at the top, adding that he had
a breakdown the previous night "because it got too much."

"We are currently raising funds and still facing rejections. We are
doing so much and it still takes much convincing and education to make
them (investors) believe in us," Vinay says.

However, looking back, he adds that he would not change a thing.

"Jo hua acha hua (Whatever happened, happened for the best). It only
made us better entrepreneurs in the processIf you don't give up, life
does give you a way out," Vinay quips.

Opinion: Quebec's language requirements put First Nations students at a
disadvantage

"Education got us into this mess and education will get us out of it."

This statement( https://www.nccie.ca/reconciliation-and-nccie/ ), made
in 2017 by the Honourable Justice Murray Sinclair, is as timely as ever,
and it should be borne in mind as Quebec legislators study Bill 96(
http://m.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-96-42-1.html
), legislation to amend the French Language Charter.

Even though Sinclair's statement points to the devastating effects of
the Indian residential school system, and speaks to the complexity of
the history of First Nations education in Canada, it also carries a
message of hope. But if systemic barriers are not overcome through
appropriate legislation, the future will be much less promising and all
hard work in this area will have been futile.

Bill 96 presents an opportunity to change laws and practices that
circumscribe the success of First Nations students in Quebec.

A large proportion of our students are enrolled in the provincial
system, outside of our communities, and are doing everything they can to
get an education in schools where instruction in many cases is in their
second language (their first being an Indigenous language).

Under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the French Language(
http://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/c-11 ), no student will
be given a high school diploma unless they meet the standards for
knowledge of French set by the province. For students in French high
schools, this means passing a standardized French exam designed for
mother-tongue francophones. Students in English schools are required to
pass a French as second language exam, when for Indigenous youth, French
may be their third language.

Under Chapter VIII.1 of the Charter, CEGEP students, as well, are bound
to fulfill requirements on the use and quality of the French language.

As an Atikamekw student accurately pointed out to me recently:
"Indigenous students always have to work twice as hard to succeed."

The consequences of the language requirements in the Quebec school
system can be quite detrimental(
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13670050308667791 ) for
First Nations youth, resulting in rapid disinterest in school among
those who see themselves as lagging behind(
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2017.1281217 ) and
set up for failure from the start. They also feel undervalued in terms
of their mother tongue(
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01434632.2014.892499 ). This
may lead them to become early school dropouts - often a prelude to
societal dropout - which in many cases only reinforces isolation and
marginalization(
https://www.afn.ca/uploads/files/education/improvingstudentoutcomes.pdf
) among First Nations youth in Quebec.

We often see the dream of becoming a professional, tradesperson or
entrepreneur turn into a summit impossible for young people to reach,
largely due to language requirements in the existing law, which are not
changed in Bill 96.

Additionally, even though schools in First Nations communities are not
subject to the Charter and Bill 96, the language requirements therein
are an obstacle to the recruitment of professionals to work in those
schools. With Quebec facing a significant labour shortage in the
education sector, First Nations communities see specialists in Ontario
and New Brunswick, including speech-language pathologists, special
education teachers and psychologists, as a source of much needed
services. However, the exemptions in the Charter of the French Language
or in Bill 96 that would allow out-of-province specialists to exercise
their professions in our schools are too narrow.

We can certainly all agree that the school system is failing students
when even just one drops out.

If the government of Quebec sincerely wants to help First Nations
students, lowering or completely applying an exemption to some of the
language requirements maintained in Bill 96 would be a good start. This
would not be to the detriment of the development of the French language.

Education?is fundamental to assuring child development and wellness,
breaking the cycle of poverty, and levelling the playing field.

With Bill 96 under clause-by-clause consideration by legislators, this
is an apt time for a reminder that we all have a duty to ensure that the
rules of the game in Quebec are fair for everyone, and that they foster
First Nations student success.

December 18 -- Salesforce, the CRM powerhouse that recently surpassed
$20 billion in annual revenue, announced today it is wading deeper into
enterprise social by acquiring Slack in a $27.7 billion megadeal. Rumors
of a pending deal surfaced last week, causing Slack's stock price to
spike.

Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff didn't mince words on his
latest purchase. "This is a match made in heaven. Together, Salesforce
and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the
way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world,"
Benioff said in a statement.

Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield was no less effusive than his future boss.
"As software plays a more and more critical role in the performance of
every organization, we share a vision of reduced complexity, increased
power and flexibility, and ultimately a greater degree of alignment and
organizational agility. Personally, I believe this is the most strategic
combination in the history of software, and I can't wait to get going,"
Butterfield said in a statement.

Every worker at every company needs to communicate, something that Slack
can ably empower. What's more, it also facilitates external
communication with customers and partners, something that should be
quite useful for a company like Salesforce and its family of offerings.

 

Ultimately, Slack was ripe for the taking. Entering 2020 it had lost
around 40% of its value since it went public. Consider that after its
most recent earnings report, the company lost 16% of its value, and
before the Salesforce deal leaked, the company was worth only a few
dollars per share more than its direct listing reference price. Toss in
net losses of $147.6 million during the two quarters ending July 31,
2020, Slack's uninspiring public valuation and its winding path to
profitability and it was a sitting target for a takeover like this one.
The only surprise here is the price.

Slack's current valuation, according to both Yahoo and Google Finance,
is just over $25 billion, which, given its very modest price change
after-hours means that the market priced the company somewhat
effectively. Slack is up around 48% from its valuation that preceded the
deal becoming known.

 

The new deal also puts Salesforce more on par - and in competition -
with its arch rival and sometime friend Microsoft, whose Teams product
has been directly challenging Slack in the market. Microsoft, which
passed on buying Slack in the past for a fraction of what Salesforce is
paying today, has made Teams a key priority in recent quarters, loathe
to cede any portion of the enterprise software market to another
company.

What really has set Slack apart from the pack, at least initially, was
its ability to integrate with other enterprise software. When you
combined that with bots, those intelligent digital helpers, the company
could potentially provide Salesforce customers with a central place to
work without changing focus because everything they need to do can be
done in Slack.

 

Today's deal comes after Salesforce's purchase of Quip in 2016 for $750
million. Quip brought to the SaaS giant a way of socially sharing
documents, and when paired with the Slack acquisition gives Salesforce a
much more robust social story to tell than its internal option Chatter,
an early attempt at enterprise social that never really caught on.

It's worth noting that Salesforce was interested in Twitter in 2016, the
same year that Microsoft was reportedly interested in Slack, but
eventually walked away from that deal when shareholders objected, not
wanting to deal with the controversial side of the social platform.

Slack was founded in 2013, but its origins go back to an online
multiplayer game company called Glitch that was founded in 2009. While
the game was ultimately a failure, the startup developed an internal
messaging system in the process of building that company that later
evolved into Slack.

The company's historic growth helped Slack raise more than $1 billion
while private, earning an impressive $7 billion valuation before going
public last year. But while the Glitch-to-unicorn story appears simple,
Slack has always faced entrenched competition from the likes of not only
Microsoft, but also Cisco, Facebook, Google and even Asana and
Monday.com.

For Slack, the path to the public markets was fraught with hype and
outsized expectation. The company was famous, or as famous as an
enterprise software company can be. At the time it felt like its debut
was the start of a long tenure as an indie company. Instead, that public
life has been cut short by a huge check. Such is the dog-eat-dog world
of tech.

Here's what a 'startup nation' is - and why governments are desperate to
create them

August 20 -- Did you know we have an online event about the future of
work coming up? Join the Future of Work track at TNW2020 to hear how
successful companies are adapting to a new way of working.

Today, becoming a "startup nation" is a public policy objective in
virtually every country in the world, be it Morocco, Bangladesh, Mexico,
or Peru. They are all rushing to follow the nations that have led the
way - the United States, China, South Korea, Israel, Canada.

France got off to a laborious start in the early 2000s, but has recently
reactivated this goal. On October 10, 2018, President Emmanuel Macron
addressed an audience of digital entrepreneurs at Station F, which calls
itself the "biggest startup campus in the world," and announced an
ambitious roadmap to assist and promote entrepreneurs in France.

Everywhere, institutional pressure to transform young people into
entrepreneurs is becoming an obsession. It's a symptom, but of what? Can
it not be seen as a sign of panic among politicians contemplating the
shortage of prospects to offer young people?

[Read: How corporate layoffs could kickstart the next wave of startups]

A cascade of service providersLet's try to interpret this strange new
command: "Become entrepreneurs!" It seems to suggest that established
institutions only open up two avenues for the younger generation: opt
for indigence with some degree of welfare assistance (e.g. a basic
living stipend) or take a gamble. If so, then encouragement to create
startups may be seen as the public face of a very discreet strategy on
the part of large state and capitalistic organizations intent on
sweeping this social issue under the carpet.

To an increasing extent, these same organizations are subcontracting,
outsourcing, automating, robotizing, and digitizing to reduce the cost
of labor as a percentage of total operating expenditure. They look for
"talent," i.e. a small minority of high-value added employees, while
systematically avoiding the employment of workers deemed
interchangeable, leaving them to the hard law of the market and
progressively transforming them into service providers; into the
providers of other providers; into the providers of providers of
providers; and so forth.

A new wave of utopiasWhat's going to happen to university graduates?
Whether they major in physical education, humanities, communication, and
journalism, marketing, or human resources, they all dream of finding
jobs that will bring them self-fulfillment and even enjoyment. In
France, they also expect five weeks of annual paid vacation and time off
in lieu of overtime pay under the "RTT" scheme.

In the 1970s, young university-goers saw themselves as radical
activists, reading Trotsky, Lenin, or Mao in preparation for the
revolution to come. To a small degree, that dream has persisted in
various forms such as eco-activism, alter-globalization, or feminism.
However, it is now part of a new wave of utopias that amalgamates
digitization, virtual reality, risk-taking, entrepreneurship, startups,
easy money, the get-rich-quick ethic, and the cult of performance.

The problem is that, in today's society, young people arrive in a job
market that is not prepared to accommodate them. Leaving them to
themselves, it calls them "entrepreneurs." This magic word, with its
connotations of freedom and hope, actually shifts responsibility for any
eventual disappointments or failures onto them and them alone. Failure
will then be a token of their inadequacy and the success of the few will
be taken as proof that the many could have done the same, as Alain
Ehernberg rightly pointed out in his book Weariness of the Self:
Diagnosing the History of Depression in the Contemporary Age.

Even brilliant successes are problematicIn a previous article, I raised
the issue of the rate at which startup founders meet with failure. I
also stressed how little we know about the collateral damage to their
lives and those of their families as well as, more generally, the social
and financial cost of aggregate business closures.

It should also be noted that even the most brilliant successes are
problematic. Inevitably, outsized ambitions to achieve impressive growth
built from nothing or virtually nothing will have moral consequences on
"les entrepreneurs et les entrepris," a phrase coined by philosopher
Héléne Verin, entrepris being a neologism for those caught up in the
toils of entrepreneurship.

I encourage you to read an article on this subject by Diana Filippova,
formerly the startup ecosystem lead at Microsoft France, in which she
expresses her indignation at the Machiavellian behavior of some of the
startup founders that have crossed her path.

In particular, she notes that young entrepreneurs, obsessed with growth
targets and under pressure to deliver results, quickly become sharks.
Some remain oblivious to the effects of their ambitions on those
involved in or affected by their venture. Many careers starting out with
the best of intentions end up marked by serial bankruptcies, business
registrations, and cynicism.

Irresponsible opportunismStartups like Cambridge Analytica or Theranos
have displayed an extreme form of irresponsible opportunism. Was Mark
Zuckerberg really so busy focusing on his own startup's mega-success
that he didn't realize what he was doing prior to testifying before
committees at the US Senate or the European Parliament committee
hearing? Have Facebook users finally gotten the picture? Have they
finally understood that Facebook, the platform enabling them to "stay
connected with family and friends," is also dirty, selling their
personal data on the sly?

One lesson to be learned from the history of capitalism is that the
accumulation of massive wealth in a very short lapse of time almost
always involves predatory activities. To cite Aristotle's terminology,
this is chrematistikos (the art of acquiring wealth), not oikonomia (the
art of running a household).

The investment funds that back startups exert pressure on them to
accumulate as much wealth as possible as quickly as possible. And
scenarios like this, in which outsized ambitions run rampant, are
precisely those in which predation becomes the most probable factor of
success.

Under pressure to succeedSome successful startups, GAFAs, and unicorns
achieve growth by crushing everything that stands in their way. But what
about the entrepreneurs whose business, mismatched with the market,
fails to get off the ground? This fragilized population is the one
likely to suffer the most from the pernicious effects of propaganda in
favor of entrepreneurship.

Want a healthier heart? Here's a guide to Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes
to lower cholesterol

Highlight: Various factors can cause unhealthy cholesterol levels. While
you cannot change the heredity factor or age & gender - you certainly
can modify your diet & make lifestyle changes that help you beat
cholesterol.

High Blood Cholesterol is a condition that can affect anyone. It is a
serious condition that increases the risk for heart disease as it is
understood that - the higher your blood cholesterol level - the greater
is your risk of developing the cardio-vascular disease.

Thankfully, there are steps one can take to lower the blood cholesterol
levels and thereby decrease the chances of heart disease. All you need
to do is follow the doctor's advice on medicines to take and carry out
Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes - or TLC and make heart-healthy choices in
your food plan.

What is Cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in
the walls of cells in all parts of the body, right from the nervous
system to the liver to the heart - and it is used to make hormones, bile
acid, Vitamin D, and other substances.

Now since these fatty cholesterol molecules cannot stream around in the
body on their own through the blood as its oily nature does not gel with
watery blood, the cholesterol travels in packages called lipoproteins
which have fat (lipid) inside and protein outside.

There are 2 kinds of lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein or LDL: Also
called the bad cholesterol as it carries cholesterol to tissues -
including arteries. The more the LDL, the higher the risk for heart
disease. High-density lipoprotein or HDL: Also called the "good"
cholesterol as it takes cholesterol from tissues to the liver, which
then removes it from the body. A low level of HDL makes one more
susceptible to acquiring heart disease.

Excess cholesterol from the blood can get trapped in the arteries,
including the coronary artery that goes to the heart. When these
cholesterol deposits stick on the inner side of the blood vessels, they
can create blockages to blood flow by the plaque formation. This can
decrease the oxygen supply and flow of nutrients to the heart -
ultimately causing a heart attack.

A note of caution: Consult your doctor before you begin to make any of
the changes that are advised here. Proceed only after your doctor's
advice to do so. No medication should ever be taken except under the
guidance and advice of a medical expert. On the doctor's advice you can
combine cholesterol-lowering drugs treatment with lifestyle changes and
reduce the risk of heart disease.

Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) to lower cholesterol:

-   Check with your doctor if you are overweight and need to reduce. Get
    a diet and exercise plan. Create a food diary and meal chart. Plan
    your meal ahead of the time, note down what you are eating. Watch
    portion sizes. Get your Body Mass Index - the ratio of your weight
    to your height checked and in what category of BMI you fall into.
    That will help you know if you are underweight, normal weight,
    overweight or obese. Check with your doctor what is the normal
    desirable) weight for you. Obesity is a condition that negatively
    affects the body's immune response to diseases.Know the calories and
    fat content of the food you eat. Check the contents of products as
    declared on the label. If your doctor has asked you to consume less
    of a nutrient such as saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium), choose
    foods with a lower per cent daily value - and if you have been asked
    to consume more fibre, ensure that it is followed.If low salt and
    low-fat consumption directions are making your food bland, you can
    spice it up with healthy, permitted spices. Add spices and herbs to
    meals while cooking to make them tastier. As long as your doctor has
    not warned you against and unless you are allergic to any spices,
    you can spice up meals with the combinations suggested
    below. Cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg etc go well with carrots. Potatoes
    taste better with garlic, onion, paprika, parsley, sage etc. Onion
    and pepper go well with greens. Tomatoes go well with basil and bay
    leaves, onion, oregano, parsley etc. Similarly, add curry powder to
    the met or lamb, garlic, mint etc. as well. Ginger and oregano,
    rosemary and thyme go well with chicken. And so on.Unless your
    doctor has told you otherwise, try to get at least 30 minutes of
    moderate-intensity activity such as a brisk walk - preferably on all
    days of the week. Other activities you can take up are dancing,
    bicycling 5 miles in 30 minutes), gardening, house-cleaning. More
    intense activities include jogging, swimming, aerobic exercises,
    playing basketball, football, tennis etc.Involve your family,
    friends: It's a good idea to talk about your plans for the
    Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes with members of your family, or
    friends. Choose to involve anyone who supports you and understands
    your need to make the changes. For example, your spouse can help you
    make healthier meal plans. Make salads and let everyone choose how
    much of the nuts, seeds, raisins, or fruits to add to their
    serving.Reward yourself for the progress you make on TLC. But the
    reward should not be a food item. Tell yourself: "When I reach my
    goal this (day/week/month) I shall treat myself to a well-deserved
    (fill in a non-food reward such as a book, a movie, a massage
    etc)."Slipped off the TLC wagon? Nevermind. Dust off the failure or
    slip-up and get started again. Figure out what you did wrong. Did
    you eat the wrong foods at the party? Everyone has a slip-up once in
    a while. Changing your lifestyle is a long-term process.

    friends. Choose to involve anyone who supports you and understands
    your need to make the changes. For example, your spouse can help you
    make healthier meal plans. Make salads and let everyone choose how
    much of the nuts, seeds, raisins, or fruits to add to their
    serving.Reward yourself for the progress you make on TLC. But the
    reward should not be a food item. Tell yourself: "When I reach my
    goal this (day/week/month) I shall treat myself to a well-deserved
    (fill in a non-food reward such as a book, a movie, a massage
    etc)."Slipped off the TLC wagon? Nevermind. Dust off the failure or
    slip-up and get started again. Figure out what you did wrong. Did
    you eat the wrong foods at the party? Everyone has a slip-up once in
    a while. Changing your lifestyle is a long-term process.   

1.  Check with your doctor if you are overweight and need to reduce. Get
    a diet and exercise plan. Create a food diary and meal chart. Plan
    your meal ahead of the time, note down what you are eating. Watch
    portion sizes. Get your Body Mass Index - the ratio of your weight
    to your height checked and in what category of BMI you fall into.

    affects the body's immune response to diseases.Know the calories and
    fat content of the food you eat. Check the contents of products as
    declared on the label. If your doctor has asked you to consume less
    of a nutrient such as saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium), choose
    foods with a lower per cent daily value - and if you have been asked
    to consume more fibre, ensure that it is followed.If low salt and
    low-fat consumption directions are making your food bland, you can
    spice it up with healthy, permitted spices. Add spices and herbs to
    meals while cooking to make them tastier. As long as your doctor has
    not warned you against and unless you are allergic to any spices,
    you can spice up meals with the combinations suggested
    below. Cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg etc go well with carrots. Potatoes
    taste better with garlic, onion, paprika, parsley, sage etc. Onion

    leaves, onion, oregano, parsley etc. Similarly, add curry powder to
    the met or lamb, garlic, mint etc. as well. Ginger and oregano,
    rosemary and thyme go well with chicken. And so on.Unless your
    doctor has told you otherwise, try to get at least 30 minutes of
    moderate-intensity activity such as a brisk walk - preferably on all
    days of the week. Other activities you can take up are dancing,
    bicycling 5 miles in 30 minutes), gardening, house-cleaning. More

Building a startup is like raising a child - One must cherish the
journey, says Girish Mathrubootham

For any startup that harbours long-term ambitions, surviving the first
year of operations and coming out unscathed is the key. The first year
brings with it self-doubts, human resource challenges, issues with
co-founders if there are multiple partners, financial crunches, and
market challenges. Tiding over these difficulties and surviving to tell
the story by making it to the second year takes guts and perseverance,
and only a few are blessed with it. YourStory is happy to present a new
series of articles as part of the series Survival Instinct; these track
how leading startups battled the demons and survived the first year of
their operations. Today we bring to you Freshdesk.

In its first year of operations, product startup Freshworks focused on
re-prioritising its feature set for the ideal product-market fit, and
providing value at a competitive price.

Girish Mathrubootham knows building a startup is like scaling a
mountain. "Being the CEO of a startup is no easy task. There is no
fallback; no administrative team, facilities department, finance,
accounting section, or HR for payroll processing. You have to jump in
and do it all - from recruiting and paying the internet bill to running
payroll and making sure there is coffee for employees. You have to take
care of everything and - yes - build the product as well," he says.

Girish did not look at it as a struggle, but as a challenge.

"It is comparable only to raising a child. Seeing your idea grow through
the stages of life," Girish says. These past few years, his 'child' has
grown well, taking long strides on the path to success.

Freshworks, which began life as Freshdesk in October 2010, has survived
the cycles of ecommerce boom and bust, and stands tall as the endgame
for every software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup in India.

The homegrown customer engagement software maker offers a suite of
products, including Freshchat, Freshcaller, Freshmarketer and Freshteam,
designed to help marketers, human resources and support professionals
engage with customers. Eight years after he started out, Freshworks
caters to more than 150,000 businesses, including big names like Honda,
Cisco, Toshiba, Bridgestone, University of Pennsylvania, and Hugo Boss,
along with small and medium businesses across the world.

The startup is running at an annual run rate of $100 million, and will,
in a few years, prepare for an IPO.

Go after a value proposition

Girish is clearly a bona fide product superstar. The man who credits his
childhood for his survival instincts has grown to love his BMWs and
Mercs, but has always been one with a vision.

His first job - in February 1999 - was at HCL-Cisco where he lasted 15
months. He found his stride at Zoho, the 17-year-old software maker
founded by Sridhar Vembu for small and medium enterprises. As the
understudy of Sridhar Vembu, Girish learnt that every product "should
start paying from day one, and provide value to its users at a
competitive price".

Girish values his experience at Zoho more than the first funding he
received from Accel Partners. "That experience is what helped me build
Freshdesk," he said in an earlier interview.

Watching Zoho disrupt the market made him think: why not go after a
value proposition himself?

In 2010, organisations had no way of reacting to customer complaints.
Users were venting their ire on social media, but no company had the
wherewithal to handle these complaints and convert them into tickets
that could be addressed. Girish set up Freshdesk to solve problems like
that. Freshworks now handles customer support across all communication
platforms, including email, web, and social media.

Focus on core problems

In a blog Girish wrote in early 2011 on why he resigned from his
comfortable, well-paying job and launched his own startup, he says he
was surprised "to see that a lot of what customers wanted was their core
problems solved, and not some fancy features like supporting customers
from their Facebook wall or converting tweets into customer support
tickets".

Girish, like Sridhar Vembu, had to contend with being a "nobody" when he
started out - the biggest hurdle that any entrepreneur faces. But, as he
has mentioned several times, there are solutions to practically
everything. In the early days, he "read a lot" to know more - about
product market fit, marketing, and the launch.

Work. Respect. Stay together

Girish tells YourStory that it is the difficult situations that expose
the strength and cohesion of the founding team in the first year.

"When it is smooth sailing, there is an uber-coolness associated with
being a startup co-founder. It has been glamourised enough. You can
gauge the respect the founding team has for each other only when the
going gets tough. This determines the success or failure of any
startup," Girish says, refusing to get into the specifics.

Girish and Shan Krishnasamy, Co-founder and CTO, started Freshdesk with
six people, and the company was incorporated in the US from India. He
spent $1,278 for incorporation in Delaware; they registered the company
in the US because he was clear the market for their product was there.

In his blog, Girish lists out several things that a startup must do if
they are focused on the US. Like in any trade, lawyer fees comprise a
majority of the costs.

Learn from your learnings

Despite his many years of work experience, the first year after starting
up brought multiple learnings for Girish and his team.

"An important learning was that customers did not want to be dealing
with separate invoices for their helpdesk, their contact management
software, for their customer feedback forums, and customer satisfaction
surveys. The SMB customer wants one invoice and as much functionality as
possible in the customer relationship management solution," he says.

Girish went on to identify under-served market segments (companies with
multi-brand support requirements) and segments that were getting priced
out because available solutions were expensive.

"We re-prioritised our feature set to what we thought was the ideal
product-market fit for us. This meant that things like Twitter and
Facebook integration could wait. But things like multiple support emails
or support for SLAs and business hours could not," he says.

Learn to prioritise

In fact, while working in their first office on the outskirts of
Chennai, Girish had his core vision clear: he had to set up a US sales
office with a 10-member team. Girish would be up in the wee hours for
calls to serve the American market. He had a single person managing
customer support in the US, and found that even when in the company of
friends or family, his mind was someplace else.

That brought the next important learning: an entrepreneur must be
detached from several things and must know how to prioritise.

"It is a great test of mental strength. You have to pick the three or
four things that are most important and keep moving on. Switching
context between the hundreds of conversations and deciding what to
prioritise is something every CEO has to master," he says.

Traction gets funding

Getting to the next level meant scaling up, but Freshworks did not have
any outside funding and did not apply to any VCs or angels in its first
year of operations. They only took funds from family and friends.

On his blog, he wrote, "Our burn rate is quite small currently - around
$5K for a six-member team and our entire team is working for around
30-50 percent of their market salary. (I don't take a salary and we all
have generous stock options). We moved in to a swanky new office for a
rent of around $160 per month! We may look for some angel/VC funding in
the near future and I read up a lot on venture hacks on how to get
funded."

He surmises that only traction gets funding. When Accel found Girish by
the end of Freshworks' first year in 2011, the investors realised that
SaaS was going to be a big business.

Accel invested $1 million in Freshworks in December 2011, but nothing
prepared them for how Girish and his team scaled up the product.

Freshworks is now valued at a billion dollars and will soon file an IPO.
Girish says he's an optimist and does not like negativity. It is this
forward-looking approach that has helped him survive and rival large
companies like Salesforce and Zendesk.

Sridhar Vembu, Co-founder of Zoho - Girish's training ground - says: "It
is completely a new world and you need to approach it with an open mind.
You cannot keep complaining."

Girish agrees. "A startup CEO requires a certain degree of mental
toughness. There are a thousand things on your plate at all times. You
cannot eat or sleep properly with your mind constantly thinking about
work," the man behind Freshworks ends.

Kazakhstan : Year of Youth will allow younger generation to expand
boundaries of their knowledge and skills a student

Jan. 23 at the opening ceremony of the Year of Youth the Head of State
Nursultan Nazarbayev instructed to create a Youth Startups Support Fund.
The decision was supported by youth representatives. A 12th grade
student of Nazarbayev Intellectual School in Almaty Ivan Krepak says
that creating a special Startup Support Fund is a great motivation for
young people to work for the well-being of the country, create startups,
learn and share knowledge.

Being a student of the 12th grage at the NIS of physics and mathematics
direction in Almaty, Ivan Krepak is a programmer, robotics and IT
security specialist. Ivan created the first smart lock in Kazakhstan,
bLock, and also developed the Zharys mobile app, which aims to increase
the participation of young people in various competitions. He is also
the developer of the Qiianat Etpe Antiterrorist Antenna project and the
author of the VoiceKomek mobile app, which allows people with hearing
and speech impairments to communicate with people who do not speak sign
language.

Today, in all international competitions and contests, our country is
represented by students of intellectual schools. I made sure that our
guys are internationally competitive. Our country has a powerful
educational potential. The state is doing a lot so that today the
atmosphere of the cult of knowledge reigned here, and young people had
the opportunity to learn and create. But in order to make it, as
Nursultan Nazarbayev says, not to fall behind, we must raise competent,
competitive and advanced youth. I sincerely believe that Jeff Bezos with
Amazon, his company Uber and his Internet giant Alibaba, can be reised
in our country, said Ivan Krepak.

Krepak believes that the most breakthrough and large-scale ideas,
discoveries that will be used not only by the country, but also by the
whole world, occur precisely at a young age. Young people are easier to
deal with problems, easier to take on complex tasks. The youth generates
bold ideas, is not afraid to implement them. The youth is not afraid of
failures.

All successful startups do not work right away on the first attempt,
successful startups are the result of experience gained from previous
failed attempts. Before launching the Zharys, I developed many other
mobile applications. Some of them were unpopular, there was flaw design,
somewhere I lacked experience, but when I started participating in
competitions, IT hackathons and other school disciplines, I realized
that only Internet is not enough for me, I should go out in people,
consult with professionals. Then I found like-minded people. I am glad
that the Head of State decided to create a special fund to support
start-ups, the young inventor shared his opinion.

He also expressed confidence that the Year of Youth will allow the
younger generation to expand the boundaries of their knowledge and
skills in the educational environment, the development of information
technology, business and other sectors of the economy and society.

The Year of Youth is a new era for Kazakhstan. This can be called
rebranding. Today, Kazakhstan in many ways overtakes not only the CIS,
but also the USA, Canada, Japan, China, Krepak noted.

Kerala Has Created A Robust Startup Ecosystem In a Non Tier 1 Space,
Says IT Secy, Kerala

Express Computer

The Indian startup ecosystem has been growing on a massive scale these
days. The Government of Kerala has been really pro-active in boosting
the startup ecosystem of Kerala, through Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM),
the central agency of the Government of Kerala for entrepreneurship
development and incubation activities in Kerala, India.

In an elaborate conversation with Express Computer's Gairika Mitra, M
Sivasankar IAS, Secretary IT, Govt. of Kerala, tells us about the
startup scene as a whole in India.

Edited excerpts:

We met last year for the annual 'Huddle Summit' at Kovalam. What has
changed ever since?

My answer would be, come and check out during this Huddle.

Seriously, I think the teething troubles and early level issues have
been managed and overcome, substantially and the startup ecosystem has
really evolved into a level of growth and maturity. Two good things
are 1) the startups are quite diverse in their field of operations from
complex hardware startups to interesting software/ app-based products
and 2) there are more and more professionals and experienced personnel
now setting up companies and student startups are getting right-sized.
With around 36 incubators, thematic accelerators and common
infrastructure like Fablabs and software suite libraries, the support
facilities are being leveraged well.

At the recent, 'Seeding Kerala' investment summit, an investment of 70
crores was announced into startups. Could you tell us more about it?

This is mostly by local angel networks, CSR and a few venture
investments as well. From Professional organisations like TiE to a local
Rice Mill (Pavizham) which invested 1 cr of their CSR on Red Button, a
woman safety device, the investors also indicate a very interesting and
healthy diversity.

As per a recent Nasscom report, over 1,300 startups have been added in
2019. The number is significantly low as compared to the West. How can
we have more startups operating in India?

It is not essentially a number game. The quality, sustainability, and
scalability are the parameters. I think if we do a health audit of
startups, failure rates are much much lower in India. At least in the
Kerala context the failed startup numbers have been very low. Instances
of pivoting also have come down drastically. This indicates that the new
generation of startups have spent lots of efforts in planning, execution
and market assessment.

That being said, the number of women entrepreneurs isn't that impressive
overall. How can this be addressed?

True. We run a program 'She Loves Tech' and also a few focused efforts
like a winter school for women startups. I think one woman startup
breaking into the big league would give a great boost to the confidence
of potential woman startups.

What kind of tech startups are operating out of Kerala now? Are you
looking forward to catering to other states too?

As I mentioned earlier from startups working on Space Technologies to
Robotics, the range is quite diverse. Kerala Blockchain Academy and
Unity center of Excellence for AR/ VR is also exciting mentoring systems
for a new breed of tech startups. FabLabs, Centers of Excellence,
Accelerators etc are available for startups from outside the state as
well.

Lastly, what are upcoming plans in the pipeline to help out startups and
have more of them?

We had focused on building the pipeline right from the school and
college levels and provided a market place by opening up Government
procurement to startups. Since we had very limited venture funding
opportunities, we started a program of Seeding Kerala. Next stage, we
set up two Fund of Funds with Startup Mission coming in as a limited
partner. Now we are Limited Partners to four such funds. Channelising
CSR, addressing working capital financing issues of startups have been
other major strategic and tactical steps. Overall there is buoyancy,
excitement and the ecosystem is stabilising. We can, I think, in all
modesty claim to have tried and created an ideal set of interventions to
build a robust startup ecosystem in a non tier 1 geography.

The great resignation is a search for greater human connectedness

MINT

November 17, 2021 Wednesday

Copyright 2021 HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved

Length: 970 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Nov. 17 -- Many of us faced several moments of intense stress
and uncertainty at the height of the covid crisis. Sporadic tests to
check whether one is infected or not, the search for an ambulance to a
take a loved one to hospital, a desperate hunt for a hospital bed and
exercises in exasperation to procure oxygen and vital medicines, we have
lived through days of extreme tension. Many of us also suffered the loss
of a loved one to the pandemic. What has been the deeper impact of this
experience of anxiety on us?

The traditional view of human behaviour during a crisis was put forward
by one of the most influential scholars of his day, Gustave Le Bon. In
his book, The Psychology of the Masses, he contends that during a crisis
"man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation". But
historian Rutger Bregman, the author of Humankind: A Hopeful History,
has a different take on human nature during a crisis. According to him,
"It is when crisis hits -when the bombs fall or the floodwaters
rise-that we humans become our best selves. Catastrophes bring out the
best in people. I know of no other sociological finding that's backed by
so much solid evidence that's so blithely ignored."

During the stressful days of the covid pandemic, most of us encountered
many a good samaritan. Most of us received help during the crisis from
unexpected quarters. The pandemic did expose many of us to the good side
of human beings. This surge of human connectedness that many of us
experienced during our most vulnerable days of the pandemic may well
have impacted our principal attitude towards life. I would argue that
the great wave of job resignations being experienced across the world is
nothing but a direct consequence of this new-found resurgence of human
connectedness.

Have these people who are resigning jobs decided to stop working? No,
they plan to work. But where are they planning to work? At a rational
level, one would argue that the uncertainties of the pandemic will
encourage individuals to seek employment in large companies that are
financially stable. But the data that is emerging shows an opposite
trend. People are resigning their stable jobs to join companies that are
much smaller, especially startups. What is the logic for this
counter-intuitive trend?

Life in a startup is quite chaotic. As compared to working in large
organizations where one's responsibilities are well defined, in a
startup, one usually has to take up multiple responsibilities, often
based on randomly articulated expectations. And on top of that, the
failure rate of startups is very high. Why then do young talented people
leave the comfort of a large and stable organization for the instability
of a startup?

In a startup, team members like to dream together. Many a time, you must
compete with a much bigger company. Being the David that is taking on
the Goliath pumps up adrenaline in the whole team. This generates an
infectious energy in most startups. In a small organization, your voice
is heard. Your opinions are valued. You might not be the most important
part of the team, but you are made an integral part of it for sure. So
you will definitely be noticed. When a startup fails, everyone involved
fails together. That togetherness for success or failure is a great
source of bonding.

The difficult times of the covid months have made people aware of one's
own vulnerability, but it also exposed many of us to the sheer joy of
experiencing human kindness. These difficult times have made us
recognize the importance of human connections. After this summer's
second wave, a large number of people are seeking emotional solace in a
less stressful and better connected work environment. Talent resigning
from large organizations in search of a more humane workplace reflects a
natural progression of the need for human connectedness brought from
latency to the surface by covid anxiety.

Very few people would have studied human connectedness better than Robin
Dunbar, emeritus professor of evolutionary psychology at Oxford
University. In his new book, Friends: Understanding the Power of Our
Most Important Relationships, he reminds us that the single most
surprising fact to emerge from medical literature over the last decade
or so has been that the number and quality of our friendships have a
significant influence on our happiness, health and even mortality risk.
Research by Tori Yu-wen Huang and Vangelis Souitaris of Cass Business
School and Sigal G. Barsade of the Wharton School at University of
Pennsylvania have shown that a bond of friendship in a business
partnership can push you to challenge as well as support each other for
the ultimate objective of the betterment of your business. Emotional
closeness among team members helps you better navigate the differences
and difficulties one might have over how a business goal is best
achieved.

The great resignation wave is essentially a search for greater human
connectedness at the workplace. Big organizations must acknowledge this
phenomenon occasioned by the pandemic. Many of them have ended up
building an impersonal, top-down organizational culture. From now on,
they need to foster a new organizational culture that is bottom-up and
empowers small groups. Robin Dunbar would remind us that such a group
size should not exceed 150 people. This is the biggest group of
individuals that a single human can have close personal relationships
with. The emotional energy of many such small groups is what will drive
the organization of the future forward.

The great resignation wave: A search for connectedness

MINT

November 17, 2021 Wednesday

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Nov. 17 -- Many of us faced several moments of intense stress
and uncertainty at the height of the covid crisis. Sporadic tests to
check whether one is infected or not, the search for an ambulance to a
take a loved one to hospital, a desperate hunt for a hospital bed and
exercises in exasperation to procure oxygen and vital medicines, we have
lived through days of extreme tension. Many of us also suffered the loss
of a loved one to the pandemic. What has been the deeper impact of this
experience of anxiety on us?

The traditional view of human behaviour during a crisis was put forward
by one of the most influential scholars of his day, Gustave Le Bon. In
his book, The Psychology of the Masses, he contends that during a crisis
"man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation". But
historian Rutger Bregman, the author of Humankind: A Hopeful History,
has a different take on human nature during a crisis. According to him,
"It is when crisis hits -when the bombs fall or the floodwaters
rise-that we humans become our best selves. Catastrophes bring out the
best in people. I know of no other sociological finding that's backed by
so much solid evidence that's so blithely ignored."

During the stressful days of the covid pandemic, most of us encountered
many a good samaritan. Most of us received help during the crisis from
unexpected quarters. The pandemic did expose many of us to the good side
of human beings. This surge of human connectedness that many of us
experienced during our most vulnerable days of the pandemic may well
have impacted our principal attitude towards life. I would argue that
the great wave of job resignations being experienced across the world is
nothing but a direct consequence of this new-found resurgence of human
connectedness.

Have these people who are resigning jobs decided to stop working? No,
they plan to work. But where are they planning to work? At a rational

Unfortunately, Indian Market Is Not Mature Enough To Talk About The IoT
Model Of Revenue Sharing

Body

The Internet of Things still have a long way to go when it comes to mass
adoption in India. While the B2B landscape has been more instrumental in
IOT adoption, the general populous is yet to figure it out.
A.Vaidyanathan, founder and managing director of Personal Air Quality
Systems (P) Ltd shares with Electronicsforu.com Network his view on the
industries and business trends that are most likely to drive IoT
adoption in India.

Q) Many opine that IoT is just a buzzword that industry Gurus have
coined to create hype? Do you agree with that line of thought?

Any initiative by the industry or the thought leaders of the industry
commenting on the canvassing of their profession looks like a cliche.
What does look like a cliche gathers some momentum. While we think to
dismiss it off as a cliche, there is a need to get an attractive caption
on the whole thing. Internet of Things (IoT) consisting of the device,
real-time data sensing and the ability to interact need to have a newer
cliche or jargon that can capture the new happenings and new enablers in
a single word.

Q) In your opinion, is the Government of India (GoI) playing any
significant role in expanding the IoT market right now?

The current government for the last two terms has made a progressive
shift towards digitisation. They have understood the virtues of
digitisation and transformation. And they are trying to encourage some
bit of IoT through various programs. I think this government has been
consciously trying to give the right type of signals in terms of the
power of digitisation and IoT.

Unfortunately, the wide acceptance or implementation of programs like
smart cities has not taken off as desired by the government. Also, it
has not been possible to define specific protocols and such in the
country. But there is a proactive thinking and a willingness to improve.

Q) Are you satisfied at the rate of deployment of IoT solutions in
India?

The current implementation of IoT is not up to the mark. Unfortunately,
Indian market is not mature enough to talk about the IoT model of
revenue sharing for the data and analytics because of which the IoT
market has not taken off. The B2B industrial space is accepting that the
IoT technology, but by and large the penetration is very poor as people
have not adapted to the new models of solutions delivery and payment
recovery mechanisms required for IoT.

Q) Which industry segments do you believe will be driving a larger chunk
of demand? Why?

The high-value addition manufacturing industry such as automobile or
defence manufacture and heavy engineering (electro-mechanical and
electronics engineering) are some segments I expect will implement IoT.
Next possibly, would be the pharma industry which will possibly have a
mix of both private and public sector companies. And the third one could
be the service industries. The hospitals and the hotels, as an industry
should get into acceptance of IoT in a far more sensitive way.

Q) What according to you is the biggest challenge for a startup in the
current scenario?

With respect to the decision making between market and talent, 5 - 7
years or a decade back, the competition could have been very fierce as
it was unthinkable for people to risk their careers and launch a
startup. Company failure was perceived as an individual failure.
Currently, the startup environment in our country has positively shifted
due to the cultural mindset and approach to welcome startups. This is
definitely not bad. However, the market remains a big challenge due to
lack of market readiness.

There is a need to recognise more R&D companies who can develop a pilot,
provide innovative solutions and then can be tried by end customers.
This requires funding. India is a large market and there are
opportunities across the country. If funding is there, then talent would
come and market space creation wouldn't be a challenge.

Q) What is the biggest obstacle that is hindering the growth of IoT?

There is a willingness and openness in the ecosystem to try new
technologies and product solutions. The government should implement that
culture into the country. ISRO and DRDO happened because the government
gave them the freedom to develop satellites and defence systems. So,
when you craft a policy, you need to welcome and embrace the new
generation of technologies such as IoT, drones, AI, AR/VR. To do this,
R&D should be given a higher importance.

The thought leaders, industries and academicians need to come together
and frame a guideline for encouraging new technologies. That will create
an incentive for enterprises belonging to private and other sectors to
try to innovate technologies by creating a large marketplace.

Q) What's your strategy to create a differentiation for your solutions
vis-a-vis your competitors?

We implement a new generation of sensors with which we try to get
reasonable and accurate data. We generate solutions with a combination
of technologies, such as - low cost, new generation of sensors, IoT
platform to get real-time data and a calibrated model that is integrated
for the machine learning layer to analyse data and get insights.

Q) How do you see your IoT-related business growing in the next 2-3
years?

It is disruptively growing and going forward it will be a paradigm
shift. The way "Uberisation" has brought car to everybody, direct cloud
has brought services to everybody, IoT will ensure multiple number of
services and technology driven backbone will ensure it's available. And
you will be agreeing to pay because the long term prospective will be
higher.

Q) What's your bigger challenge-acquiring customers or acquiring talent?
What's your strategy in resolving the same?

Well, a startup has got multiple challenges. Getting the talent pool and
getting the marketplace is equally difficult. Without any doubt, getting
funding is also a challenge. If you are a technology company with solid
technology pioneering initiative, very often people are less of a
problem because people are willing to take a chance. Unlike the past,
investors are willing to take a plunge into a startup. When there is a
stimulation; a lot more excitement, then marketing can be a challenge.
Each one can be a challenge for different people.

Q) How would you describe your solution to a non-technical
decision-maker at the client's end?

When you talk about a pioneering or a technology solution, then it is
always an issue. Today people have understood Cloud Computing and IoT,
but what have they really understood? Anytime when you talk about a
technology-driven new solution, the perception of the market is
different. So, if I try to say any IoT solution about air quality
because I believe it's data that's a starting point, then I'm having the
same problem because people say, "What are you talking about data, give
me a solution." But there isn't a solution without accurate data. So I
am struggling. But when you talk of a technology solution driven by
data, we need to believe that data will start fetching money. Initially,
getting money through data is a challenge. So to close back on facts,
what do we do? We are providing cleaner solutions delivered by accurate
data, we are providing clean air solutions driven by accurate data. We
have solutions for different verticals. When you talk about smart
buildings, increasingly people are understanding better. Smart spaces
and cities are made by data-driven solutions.

Content Czarina Ekta Kapoor as a filmmaker has pioneered varied
platforms. While she is gearing up for her film release, she is
delivering content to OTT viewers and TV audience simultaneously.

Ekta Kapoor who is currently gearing up for her upcoming film 'Veere Di
Wedding' shared her thoughts on the same saying, "I am like an ostrich.
I put the work out and then I shut myself because people will say a lot
of things. Now, we are moving towards its release, so we are all in the
execution mode from putting out the promos, songs and new visuals."

Talking about the expectations of the audience, Ekta revealed she
doesn't feel any burden, "Actually, I don't because I believe you can't
start getting too tied up with success and failure. Actually, my burdens
are very different. For example, my neck is hurting now, so I am worried
ki kuch hua toh nahi mujhe (laughs). I have learnt from my failures and
I don't get fascinated by success. After VDW, I will move on to Mental
Hai Kya (with Kangana Ranaut). So every time, I get in to a new project,
I don't think of the previous one."

Breaking stereotypes in the entertainment world, Ekta Kapoor carved a
niche for her own, creating new content for the audience. Ekta has very
well known the pulse of her viewers and delivered the best time and
again.

Living by her own terms, Ekta Kapoor shared, " My whole thing is, 'why
limit ourselves'. At any point of time, if we feel, 'yeh chalega nahi,
then it's like we are listening to rules that our industry forefathers
set for us'. Every day, we get exposed to fresh content, work in
different mediums, and evolve more. We are becoming smarter and evolving
every day and so is the world, so why follow the old rules? Sometimes, I
do feel that I am a bit too stretched [for time]. But I love my job. I
get stressed only when I have to go to parties or sit for interviews
(laughs). I am the happiest when I do creative work. My job is my party.
I am getting a chance to live the life of three different creators on
three different mediums. TV is all about family audience, and I am also
busy with VDW, which are two different worlds. Then, I am also sitting
on something absolutely distinct like Mental Hai Kya. Plus, there is
also Gandi Baat (web series). So I have an opportunity to explore my
mind, and learn so much from various people. Yes, multitasking is going
to take a toll on you and it does. But I think I am doing a fun job and
I should be very grateful."

Hailed to be the TRP Queen and the pioneer of daily soap entertainment,
Ekta Kapoor solely changed the face of Indian TV. After conquering TV,
the content czarina is leaving impressive imprints on the cine-goers.
Ekta Kapoor clearly knows the pulse of viewers across the platform as
she gave us movies based on different genres.

Her latest domain being the Digital platform, Ekta has tailor-made
content for the online audience. She has her own digital video streaming
service where she brings in content for the younger generation who
prefer watching content on their phones as opposed to Television.

Human resources: Utilization and exploitation!

The Sentinel

Today's workplace dynamics demand efficient employees. After the global
COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a lot of change in how organizations
work. From new recruitments to mass layoffs, salary hikes to
retrenchments, the failure of startups to rise in corporate culture,
work from home, online meetings, and so much more - Businesses have seen
it all.

The Human Resources (HR) department ensures a positive employee
experience in every organization. HR professionals are imperative in the
holistic growth of a business. HRs share a special connection with every
employee. They manage a company's most valuable asset - the employees.

On 20th May every year, we celebrate International HR Day. We celebrated
the same this year too. The theme for this year was "Shaping the new
future." This theme points to the role of HR as the driving force in
building a more inclusive, accepting, and sustainable future of work.

The human resources (HR) department is expected to handle human resource
management functions. Some examples of it include finding, hiring,
training, and supporting new employees. HR departments are responsible
for such important tasks as reviewing resumes, keeping track of employee
information, and ensuring a company complies with labor laws and
employment standards.

In other words, HRs are responsible for screening, recruiting, and
training employees and implementing employee processes. HRs also
administer compensation benefits. HR departments add value to an
organization by providing objective guidance to managers and employees
on people-related matters.

Today, HRs lay a special focus on mental health importance. To create a
healthy workspace, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests, among
other things, the importance of understanding the opportunities and
needs of individual employees is important.

It is equally significant to focus on interventions and good practices
that protect and promote mental health in the workplace and become aware
of how the workplace environment can adapt to promote better mental
health for employees and support sources where people can find help, WHO
highlights.

The United Nations (UN) underlines that HRs are important in supporting
employee mental health and well-being. HRs initiate to improve workplace
culture, providing managers with education and supporting personnel
through all phases of their employment.

HRs hold a significant position in the well-running of an organization.
But what if they fail at their job role? What if a company lacks
experienced HR professionals? Any mismanagement of human resources may
lead to chaos in the organization.

On the one hand, proper utilization of human resources results in high
employee productivity, skill development, organizational commitment, and
career development. When employee performance increases, the overall
organizational performance is also enhanced.

Human resource monitoring and evaluation help attract, motivate, and
retain employees. Training and development opportunities should be
incorporated into a corporate culture. Employee upskilling leads to a
win-win situation between employers and employees.

HRs should also monitor the voluntary participation and involvement of
the employees in organizational initiatives. Employee engagement should
be encouraged in the broader interest of employees' career growth while
building a progressive work culture. Human resources are truly an asset.

On the other hand, underutilization of human resources leads to severe
inefficiency. It refers to an organization not fully utilizing its
workforce's skills, knowledge, and abilities.

Underutilization of human resources is a situation that may be a cause
of concern for HRs or HR practitioners.

To address underutilization, organizations can create more opportunities
for cross-functional collaboration. The HRs may ensure that job roles
and responsibilities are clearly defined and aligned with employee
skills and abilities. If the working potential of employees is not fully
utilized, it can result in a waste of resources.

After the COVID-19 pandemic, hybrid work culture is a new practice. It
is an arrangement where employees come to the office occasionally and
complete the rest of the tasks by working from home, depending on their
convenience. It reduces an organization's operating costs. It also helps
employees save on transportation expenses.

In that case, HRs need to ensure employees' work-life balance.
Flexibility in the work schedule would help boost employee productivity.
It will help HRs foster a win-win situation between the organization and
the human resources it invests in.

During recruitment, HRs should promote gender equality. Organizations
must practice equal pay. Companies should ensure that there is no gender
gap in the workplace. It also boosts employee morale and thus sets an
example for other organizations in a corporate culture.

It is worrying that India has one of the highest gender gap magnitudes
in the world. Statistics by the International Labour Organization (ILO)
state India's gender gap magnitude is 50.9 (in percentage points.) And
women in the labor force are as low as 19.2% in India, while men in the
labor force stand at 70.1% in our country today. 15% of working-age
women globally would like to work but do not have a job. It has remained
almost unchanged for two decades (2005-2022).

At the office, HRs must keep a check on workplace harassment. Any form
of verbal harassment, psychological harassment, cyber bullying, sexual
harassment, or physical harassment is unwelcome. Ensuring a workplace
free from harassment extends positive employee experience.

As we celebrated International HR Day, let us acknowledge how the HR
community clinches critical human resources management. Regular
seminars, lectures, or workshops help the employees gain professional
knowledge on concerned subjects. Practising diversity, inclusion, and
tolerance makes employees feel integral to the team.

Today, there are a lot of organisations working in the fields of
employee engagement, rewards and recognition, employee benefits, etc.
They are bridging the gap between employers and employees. The business
revolves around building an engaged, productive, and happier workforce.

Some of the leading players in this sector are organisations such as
Vantage Circle, founded in 2011, Xoxoday (2012), Awardco (2015), Bonusly
(2012), Reward Gateway (2006), Kudos (2010), Achievers (2002), etc.
Their service is to provide holistic employee engagement solutions.

Following good human resources management techniques will promote
optimal utilisation of human resources. It shall lead us on a positive
note, where exploitation is zeroed out. Our conscientious HRs may
collectively take up the onus to build their respective workplaces
exemplary, exhorting all effort towards curtailing any possible
exploitation of human resources by upping utilisation of employee
potential through innovative and righteous interferences at the offices
and beyond.

Let every HR department be the flagbearer of change, fostering
collaboration for an improved work culture in every sector. HRs can
thereby contribute to the long-term success of their respective
organisations. At the same time, they would thus present better human
resources to our society and prove the deserved worth of human resources
through the valued profession.

How and why digital transformation is sweeping across Indian industries

The Economic Times

November 27, 2022 Sunday

Length: 855 words

Marc Andreessen quoted in 2011 - "software is eating the world". The
prophecy is already a reality today.The hyperconnected world is here,
and it's bringing with it an acceleration of innovation and disruption.
For years, we have been told that the internet was a "nice-to-have" - an
additional channel for growth. Today, the internet has evolved to become
the established channel for expansion and innovation. In this new era,
there are opportunities everywhere that can be seized by those who
understand how to harness its power.

The internet has been unleashed upon us, and now it's up to you whether
or not you're ready for it.In fact, the 2020 World Economic Forum
reported that the number of internet users hit over 4.8 billion
worldwide with $1 million spent every minute on commodities online.
India has nearly 700 million internet users largely accessing the
internet via mobile, and is expected to have close to 900 million by
2025. The internet population in India is more than double the entire
population of the United States which has helped the country in
reshaping itself in the age of digital globalisation. As digital
capabilities improve and connectivity becomes more ubiquitous,
technology is poised to alter nearly rapidly and dramatically every
sector of India's economy. This is likely to have a significant economic
impact as well as change the nature of work for millions of Indians.Even
as the economy is emerging from the brutal blow of Covid, the year 2022
had begun with a strong rally in digital payments in the first month.
Online transaction volumes from tier 2 and 3 cities on private payment
gateways during 2021 show growth of 45.6 percent and 54.3 percent
respectively, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). One can
certainly say that our country's journey towards digital transformation
is real, to cite an example - buying one's own daily household items and
almost not carrying a wallet or physical money, as Indian citizens have
accepted all forms of digital payments.The software industry in India is
at least 25 years old, but it never brought about the digital
transformation that the country has witnessed in recent times. So, what
suddenly changed?? Growth and evolution of India's software industry:
Earlier, India was a producer of software. Post Reliance Jio,
demonetisation, and Covid, it has become a consumer of its own software
in a big way. Previously, applications were only written for a global
audience and fitted to Indian needs (or the needs were fitted to the
application written). In today's scenario, they are more local and
hyper-local in nature, considering the requirements of their consumers
which one could not think of as Indians consuming their own software. ?
Driving internet inclusion: Internet connectivity in rural India is
increasing at a rapid pace and will soon surpass urban connectivity. In
today's time, people in the remotest of villages have a high-speed and
high data internet connection, at nominal prices which has suddenly
increased the number of users for any utility. ? Market size and
opportunity: With the country's population at 1.4 billion, there is
enough market for 10 similar products to exist, reducing the risk of
failure for startups. The markets have investments and it's clear that
large markets are the only way to make the math work, as the startups
need to have the ability to grow considerably. These days, new-age tech
startups are staying ahead of the digital transformation curve by
focusing on digital technologies and automation standards including big
data, predictive analytics, AI, cloud computing, and IoT.India is
entering an advanced era where the fourth industrial revolution
technologies such as AI are being infused into the world at an
exponential rate. Organisations across the country are harnessing their
potential to reinvent their business models, create new avenues of
market growth, and address critical societal needs. With the expeditious
growth of digital technology, one can expect industries as diverse as
manufacturing, agriculture, health, energy, and mobility to be a part of
this transformation which will help in creating a robust ecosystem that
will be a massive upward spiral.Digital technology and the data
revolution have increased public service efficiency, transparency, and
most importantly, the citizens' trust. Citizens feel more empowered
about their improved quality of life every new season. With 5G and other
emerging technologies in the picture, the availability of more powerful
devices, evolving startup ecosystem, increased appetite for innovation,
and enterprises realising the value of a software-enabled business are
empowering the country's growth towards the digital revolution. With
each step forward in technology, there is a great chance for
organisations to create something new, something that will benefit
people all over the world. Now, it is imperative to take the next big
step, as the future is here, and these are the exciting times to live
in.The writer is Senior Vice President, Strategy & Technology APAC,

It takes blood, sweat, and tears to build a business from scratch.
Entrepreneurs who overcome these odds through their sheer resilience are
the ones setting examples for others.

SMBStory lists the success stories of five Indian entrepreneurs who
built multi-crore businesses in their 30s.

Bala Sarda, Vahdam Teas

Hailing from a family of tea exporters, Bala Sarda grew up in an
environment in substantial know how of the tea industry was inevitable.

In 2015, at the age of 23, Bala founded Vahdam Teas in New Delhi - a
digitally native, vertically integrated global wellness brand - that
ships one of India's finest teas to the world.

Although Indian teas are in wide demand, Bala felt India as a brand is
not efficiently placed in foreign markets. He started by exporting tea
to the US after passing the USDA certification and non-GMO verification.

"Not many brands take the initiative to promote Indian tea by launching
a homegrown brand in foreign countries. You see Starbucks introducing
turmeric latte. It is Westerners who are promoting the benefits of our
homegrown products, so why shouldn't we? I wanted to crack this
opportunity and retain the value at the source," he explains.

Besides the US market, Bala later explored Canada, the UK, and Germany
as potential markets.

Vahdam is now available in over 1,000 brick and mortar shops in the US.
It is one of the first few Indian brands to list in premium and legacy
retail chains in the US, including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus,
Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

At present, it has around 175 SKUs, including pyramid-tea bags,
superfoods, gift sets, assortments, teaware, and drinkware.

In FY20, the company clocked Rs 145 crore so far. Bala says Vahdam has
around 1.5 million US customers.

Rishabh Chokhani, Naturevibe Botanicals

At the age of 29, when Rishabh Chokhani decided to adopt clean eating,
he couldn't believe the impact on his body. The transformation did not
take long to show, and the results were astonishing - both physically
and mentally.

As his family business was into pharmaceuticals, this made it easier for
him to study wellness and related industries.

Building a multi-crore business from scratch takes a lot of hard work,
dedication, and determination. SMBStory lists stories of five such
entrepreneurs.

Rishabh sensed a huge opportunity in the organic foods industry and
decided to set up his business along the same lines, and thus started
Naturevibe Botanicals in 2017 in Mumbai.

"In India, at the time, the organic products market was still growing.
However, in the US, it was already a huge craze. Though most of the
natural ingredients used in any product have roots in India, there were
very few Indian suppliers in the foreign market," Rishabh tells
SMBStory.

He started by catering to the US market and soon expanded to Europe.
After operating in these foreign markets and getting know-how of the
industry, Rishabh ventured into India in 2019.

Naturevibe Botanicals boasts superfoods, organic food, Ayurvedic
supplements, staples, groceries, essential oils, massage oils, etc. The
products, over 650 in range, are manufactured in its facility located in
Raigarh, Maharashtra.

Today, Rishabh claims the company is exporting Indian botanicals worth
Rs 250 crore and clocked a turnover of Rs 140 crore in FY 20-21, with a
global customer retention rate of 40 percent.

Pallav Bihani, Boldfit

Pallav Bihani, Founder, Boldfit

Being fit is important for everyone. Twenty-five-year-old entrepreneur
Pallav Bihani realised this quite early when he suffered from a slipped
disc while in school.

"I was 105 kilograms, and I realised I must start a fitness regime to
stay healthy. In the first year of my college, I hit the gym and started
taking health supplements. It took a little while, but I was able to
bring down my weight. But there was one thing that hit me - fitness
affordability," Pallav tells SMBStory.

He explains fitness is not affordable in India. Right from health
supplements and fitness accessories to immunity boosters - people cannot
afford such high costs.

He founded Boldfit in Bengaluru in January 2019 to make fitness
available for everyone. He started the D2C health and fitness ecommerce
brand after taking a loan of Rs 8 lakh from his father.

The cash was less to set up a whole manufacturing infrastructure and
Pallav wasn't ready to seek any external funding, and so he decided to
start small and began with yoga mats.

Starting with just one product, Boldfit now has 30 SKUs across
categories, including fitness and yoga, nutrition, health, and wellness.
In two years, Pallav claims to be clocking an annual turnover of Rs 30
crore as of December 2020.

Keshav Rai, Bike Blazer

Keshav Rai, Founder, Bike Blazer

Twenty-seven-year-old Keshav Rai was an average student in school and
not very academically inclined. His keen interest to repair things
around him led him to pursue engineering.

While in college, Keshav says he would discuss startup ideas with his
friends. He requested his father to fund one of his app-based businesses
in 2015.

But as they say, timing is everything. If it's meant to happen, it will.
Keshav's first startup was a failure. But his will to innovate and learn
gave him entrepreneurial success later.

One day, he decided to pack his bags and left home telling his parents
that he would return in four days. He walked on the streets for three
days without being able to come up with any ideas to secure his future.

However, on the fourth day, while Keshav was on his way back home, he
was sitting in the parking lot of a metro station in Delhi and saw a man
searching for a dusting fabric to wipe his bike. As he couldn't find
anything, he took the duster from a bike next to him, wiped his bike,
and went away.

Seeing this, Keshav decided to make a second attempt and started Bike
Blazer in late 2016.

Bike Blazer offers two-wheeler water-resistant parking covers that
protect vehicles from dust. The handy device can be fixed on the vehicle
and the overall operational time of the cover is below 30 seconds, says
Keshav.

Bike Blazer is now seeing an annual turnover of Rs 1.3 crore as of FY
21.

Jay K Mulchandani, CoreB Group

Jay K Mulchandani, Founder and MD, CoreB Group

Jay K Mulchandani was just 14 when he started helping his grain merchant
father in his business. Hailing from Kotputli, Rajasthan, Jay loved to
study, and his parents wanted him to pursue the great Indian IIT dream.
However, he could not clear the competitive exam on the first attempt
and did not get into IIT.

Though Jay pursued mechanical engineering from another college and
landed up a job with a reputed auto manufacturing company, the salary
offered to him lowered his morale.

Jay started taking commissions on the sale of each truck, and one day,
while attending an event, Jay's enthusiastic sales efforts were noticed
by the rival company's leadership, whose manager soon offered Jay a new
job and a better package.

"I was transferred to Barmer, a desert area in Rajasthan, to sell
trucks. This was a setback for me as it was hard to pitch to clients in
such a place. But I found there was a lot of demand for second-hand and
older trucks," he says.

Jay didn't overthink it, and he decided to resign. A deep-rooted desire
to start a business was the cause, and he thought the time had come to
work on it.

As someone once said, nothing is a waste of time if one uses the
experience wisely. Understanding the demand for refurbished old trucks
in many parts of Rajasthan, Jay decided to tap into this gap and ideated
upon three manufacturing options - trucks, spare parts, or trailers.

It is the first company to introduce aluminium trailers and 52 tonner
trailers in India.

CoreB Group has upscaled its operations from a production capacity of
800 trailers per annum in 2017 to 2,000 trailers per annum.

The company raked in Rs 40 crore turnover in the last fiscal year,
taking the projected turnover of CoreB Group to Rs 100 crore in the
current financial year.

In this guide we let you know about the Top 10 important mistake which
has been done by Indian Startups in initial days.

The Biggest reason That is considered for the failure of a startup is
Lack of Funding and Lack of Management. But here I would like to point
out to you that if you are not taking care of Legal formalities and
Complying with legal requirements of the country then it could also
result in failure of Startup company. So In this article, I will provide
you a list of Legal mistakes or Legal blunders that is committed by the
Indian startup companies that you need to pay attention to in order to
Ensure that your startup business does not shut down.

10 legal mistakes that are made by Indian startups

1). Not choosing private limited company or LLP as a legal entity for
business

For any Startup company in India, It is Advisable to Register your
Startup company as a Private Limited company or a Limited Liability
Partnership. But If you take the case of Most Indian Startup companies,
They opt for Sole Proprietorship as a legal entity, As one can open a
sole proprietorship firm without registration.

Here I would Like to Point out to you that for any business to be
recognized as a startup in India, it is essential that Startup company
should be registered as Private Limited company or LLP. Because If it is
not then It would not be able to get Benefits or advantages that are
provided by the Government of India such startup India loan scheme, Tax
holidays, The Venture Capital Assistance Scheme, Raw Material
Assistance, MSME Market Development Assistance, Atal Incubation Centres
(AIC) and Startup assistance Scheme etc. Also, I would like to tell you
that most of The Investors prefer to invest their money in private
limited companies or Limited Liability Partnership.

2). Not opting for partnership registration and no formation of
partnership deed

If you have started a Startup company as a partnership Firm Then you
must get it registered or form a Partnership deed so that your
partnership firm will have a proper corporate structure as All the Terms
and conditions will be laid out and Will be noted with the registrar of
Firms so that any conflict whether legal or Business related can be
dealt with properly and accurately. And also online registration of
partnership firm will help in getting Startup recognition in India.

3). Delay or neglect of licenses that are required by the startups

Sometimes some startup companies Delay or Neglect to get Shop Act
Licenses, FssaI License, Health Trade License or Any other state License
that is required to Conduct a Business. Make sure That You are aware of
all The Licensing That is required in your state and Country where your
business is Located.

4) Register under Taxation Laws

No Company or Business is off limits to radar or Taxes. Startup
companies are also taxed and startup companies should also get Tax
registration such as GST registration and Startup company Should get Pan
Card in The Name Of the company to file income tax return. Startup
company should Gst Return Filing and income tax Return.

5). Not complying with Security Laws

As a Startup Company, you should Be familiar with Laws That are set up
by the SEBI or Securities and Exchange Board of India, As Sebi Updates
Security laws on Periodical Basis.

6) Not ensuring compliances with IT and Cyber laws

The Privacy Policy statement should be formed and displayed on your
website and app. In your Privacy Policy statement you should mention how
much personal data will be collected and How you will use user Personal
Data. Also, your Company should get SSL certificate for App and website.

7) No formation of company policy and procedure

Your Company should Have Proper Policies and Procedure laid out and
Policy and procedure statement should Clearly state terms and conditions
that will guide in Management of the company.

8) Lack of knowledge of Labour laws prevailing in the country

As a startup company you should be aware of the labour laws such as The
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947,The Trade Unit Act, 1926,Building and
Other Constructions Workers' Act, 1996,The Industrial Employment Act,
1946,The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972,The Contract Labour Act, 1970,The
Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and
The Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 etc .

9). Not obtaining Trademark and Patent registration

As a Startup company if you have developed any innovative and New
Product, business model or a Technology, to protect it From Getting
copied by The rival companies you are required to get a Trademark or
Patent registration but due to tedious process of Trademark
Registration, many startup companies disregard getting a Patent or
Trademark which prevents them to take action on company that has copied
there product or service.

10). Now hiring professional legal counsel

Sometimes to save cost and expenses Startup companies hire Inexperienced
legal counsel who is friends or relatives or provide discounts which
lead to many Legal problems for the company. Therefore, I would like to
point out that A startup company seeks the service of a competent and
Professional Legal Service Provider.

So above are the Top 10 mistake which happens with the Indian Startups.

Application Of Natural Law is Key To Success & Sustainability- Nicola
Grace, Founder Mission Mastery Academy Australia

Business World

Strategy and business model piece was a great session at women economic
forum 2018 to identify the traits that can lead to failure of new
businesses initiative.

Humanity confronts an existential threat without historic precedent.
Environmental pressures have reached such intensity and pace of change
that the earth system may be irreversibly tipped into a new and
unpredictable state. Bhavini Mehta, founder of Infinity business
solutions shared her personal insight on how the effective strategy can
help you get through the achievable and sometimes unachievable target.
She has described the percentage of entrepreneurial skills that could
not make it to more than five years of there starting. She has shared a
massive 90 per cent failure of startups as they do not know how to make
effective and efficient strategies.

The emerging global reality is, in turn, redefining overall conditions
for business success. Addressing these challenges both demands and
brings great opportunities for innovation. An important and sometimes
neglected aspect of innovation is the design or redesign of business
models, which has been identified as a greater source of lasting
competitive advantage than new products and services. Bhavini has also
shared a sensitive fact that out of five per cent entrepreneurs who
remain alive in business other than those 95 per cent who do not make it
more than five years. Hardly one per cent make it good and become
successful. This sends the importance of business models. The business
model has also been suggested as a new unit of analysis when discussing
sustainability. However, this is still a relatively underexplored area.

To be able to design a business model that supports strategic
sustainable development, it is necessary to know what sustainability is
and how to develop sustainability-promoting, economically viable
strategies. As Bhavini said execution and processing of business are
also very important. A business strategy is at it's best only when it
allows a business to run on an auto mode, where physical absence does
not make a difference in business operations. Self-sustainability of a
business is also a key aspect of how a business should behave in it's
functionality.

Nicola Grace from Mission Mastery Academy Australia shared that it was
hardly a 43 per cent chance of failure of new businesses in the early
60s. Replying to a question that population might have played a major
role she said that it is true that ideas are floating more in today's
connected world but around 90 per cent of business end nowhere today in
comparison to 43 per cent of the 60s decade. A true example for a
business model can be achieved from a 100 per cent sustainability that
nature provides without losing efficiency. So, it's not the people who
fail they just don't know how to materialize aspects of the business.
She has also shared an example of how pharmaceutical crime in Australia
and New Zealand managed to surpass government policy because the money
spent to prevent malpractice and the money to continue it was equal. A
natural sustainability model for business then let it get resolved in
six months that took seven years for the government to identify the
cause. It is finally believed that application of natural law is key to
sustainability and success of any entrepreneurial initiative.

Does Venture debt make sense for banks?; Last September, the Reserve

to 10 percent of the paid-up or unit capital in Category-I or
Category-II Alter...

The Indian startup juggernaut is breaching new milestones every day.
From raising eye-popping rounds to consolidation to attracting top CXO
level talent, the startups have proved their worth on every count.
Around 900 startups raised close to $14 billion last year. E-commerce
giant Flipkart has raised close to $6.1 billion over the years in
funding. Recently, read-to-cook food maker Fingerlix raised $1.3
million.

Clearly, the startup ecosystem lacks neither entrepreneurs nor investors
ready to pump funds into new and innovative ideas. While new ideas are
pouring in, the sector itself is over ten years old. Which leaves us
with the question, when will banks join the party?

Bankers too have been silently watching the revolution and are exploring
ways to hop on to the startups' bus. Last September, the Reserve Bank of
India provided a much-needed clarity on the ability of banks to take
part in venture funding. RBI gave a go-ahead for banks to invest up to
10 percent of the paid-up or unit capital in Category-I or Category-II
Alternative Investment Funds. Private equity and venture debt fund falls
under the Category II, as specified by the Central Bank. This is proving
to be a booster shot for bankers keen on backing startups.

Currently, two Indian banks have joined forces with venture investors
and backed their Venture Debt Fund. Alteria Capital partnered with
IndusInd Bank and Ratnakar Bank partnered with Trifecta Capital for
similar funds. It is important to note that mid-sized banks and large
banks are most excited to partner venture debt funds.

Why does VDF make sense?

Does it make sense for banks to launch venture debt funds? Currently,
bank lending can be categorized in two major areas - retail and
corporate. Today, banks are burdened with NPAs sitting on their books
and generally muted economy, thereby left with tepid growth.

While industries and other sectors too are playing the wait-and-watch
game, startups are not flinching before investing money into new
ventures. Venture capital funds and Angel investors have returns that
are significant, in very short periods of time. It is low hanging fruit
for banks with attractive returns in the horizon.

Bank can earn good interest by investing in Venture debt funds that lend
to startups. Project finance and providing lines of credit for working
capital to large companies provides lower rates of return than funding a
company, which is charting a high growth path.

Corporate loans vs VDFs

VDF interest rate is much higher than traditional lending, and brings an
opportunity for banks to earn high yields. These funds are also flexible
as VDF pays banks interest rates on quarterly basis, from the debt fund.
These funds also have provisions to acquire in the borrowing startup
Company, equity warrants along with debt, which have the potential to
generate significant returns if a venture turns successful. More so,
since a VDF handles all the operational efforts of investments, these
returns can come with lesser efforts. Currently, such fast-growing
innovators cannot borrow directly from banks due to traditional
collateral-based loan rule.

A large number of startups are on path to become SMEs or MSMEs or even
listed entities in the future. Early relationship with startups can help
establish a lasting source of income. When a bank invests in VDF, the
bank may retain multiple rights as to where a VDF will lend, which may
also include offering: banking facilities to the startup exclusively.
Subsequently, banks can benefit through CASA and transactions fees apart
from the VDF investments.

How do VDFs work?

Venture Debt Funds lend money to startups in a structured manner. A lot
of startups fail when they face delays in payments and end up exhausting
all their cash. Being cash positive is their biggest financial challenge
and VDFs infuse structure cash flow into such startups and protect them
against failure. When startups know that there is a steady flow of cash
from VDFs, there are fewer chances of failure.

Challenges for banks

Though VDFs sound very lucrative, like attractive investments but they
come with their own limitations. Banks are still guided by traditional
principles, which make it tough for them to absorb new or unheard-of
category of investments in funds lending to startup sector where success
rate is doubtful. Banks are too regulated, making it painful for them to
streamline their processes, especially their risk mechanisms, which are
tailor-made for corporates and not startups.

Startup Valuation: When profitability is no longer a criterion

July 21 -- Loss-making Zomato IPO's oversubscription contributed by
qualified institutional buyers' (QIB) and retail category's vehement
response and that of Paytm's soon-to-be mage debut of Rs 16,000 crore in
the last 10 years since the 2010 issue by the Coal India has led to the
discussion of the emerging criteria of startup valuation. 'Profitability
insignificant'Are the traditional valuation methods of earning, EBITDA
or P/E multiple no longer considered? Experts, especially after Zomato's
public issue, have explained the importance of valuation and advised
investors to take care of certain parameters before making any
substantial investment, which brings us to the question- is
profitability insignificant in the valuation of a startup? Do
loss-making startups have a better chance of sustenance after their
public floating and remain high-valued?

Management and ETMasterclass - A Division of The Economic Times.

One of the core goals of business sustenance for startups is their
eventual scalability (of course, a sound idea precedes every requirement
of sustenance) over the growth, implying growing revenue at a rapid rate
over costs rather than increasing revenue and resources.

Zomato not alone

In the last five years, India has witnessed the rise of loss-making yet
high valued startups, such as Paytm, Oyo, Ola, Policybazaar, Mobikwik,
Nykaa, Delhivery, Indiamart, Easymytrip and Zomato, while the trend was
initiated by the InfoEdge, Indian first internet firm.

Like Zomato, these ventures are also going for their public floating,
likely in this year itself, debuting as listings of loss-making
companies.

The subscription result of Zomato especially that its 20 per cent of
applications were done by another startup stock broking firm Zerodha
speaks volumes on the changing business climate for startups in India..

As Nithin Kamath the founder of Zerodha mentioned, "Zomato IPO would
pave way for other Indian start-ups to go for IPOs in Indian markets, as
Indian markets are the best platform for all the stakeholders i.e.,
company, investors and customers."

Losses to continue

Interestingly, none of these startups, despite their listing as a
loss-making company in the Indian public market, intends to earn an
immediate profit- for instance, Zomato, in its regulatory filings with 

SEBI

, has disclosed it would be many years before it declares any profit.
Other instances of high-valued Indian startups include Swiggy and
Flipkart. Swiggy accounted for a loss of INR 397.30 crore in FY18 from
INR 137 crore in 2016, but its valuation increased manifold to INR
8660.4 crore.

Similarly, the Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart reported its loss of INR
545 crore in FY16, which went up to INR 2064.80 in FY18; however,
Walmart acquired its 77% stake in 2018 valued it at $21 billion.

Valuation metrics for startup

So, coming to the first question on the declining importance of
profitability for valuation of Indian startups- well, the valuation
index for startups- a temporary entity scientifically solving people's
needs- is different from the valuation of an established business. 

For valuation, the question lies in the contribution of the startup IPO,
here Zomato, in the unit economics and its competitive advantage
shortly, along with the above metrics. It seems that the metrics for
startups are different from the usual price-to-earnings ratio, net
profit; EBITDA; discounted cash flows, etc. metrics.

Startups are valued based on their user base- both captured and
uncaptured, repeat user rate, customer acquisition costs and customer
spend, investments to create new revenue streams and vertical credit
tech to lead the next growth wave..

Simply put, these loss-making startups are redefining the valuation
metrics followed up until now in India through "inverse
proportionality". Valuations are typically a function of projected
revenue, based on assumptions that unit economics will work out once the
competition is killed. Nonetheless, not in all cases, competition can be
diminished, as can be understood from PayTm's case. 

Paytm intends to achieve $2.5-3 billion as IPO and is expected to
improve unit economics by experts through a break-even in 12 to 18
months. 

Thus, it is forecasted to continue as India's largest payment and
fintech ecosystem, despite strong competition from similar entities like
Google Pay, Amazon Pay, BHIM, PhonePe and WhatsApp's payments
challenging its monopoly and will have a total throughput of $52 billion
in FY21- a 33% increase year-on-year.

Different metrics implications

Financial experts' reasoned these changing yardsticks for valuation with
the assumption of Indian companies that they will drive out competition.
Therefore, two or three strong companies would survive and make profits.
That is the hope driving valuations.

Moreover, there is an assumption on losses, which if, lower, is seen in
a very positive light.

Consequently, a significant portion of the funds that a company raises
continues to be allocated for loss funding, achieving scale, customer
acquisition and driving out competition. Investors like SoftBank and
Naspers opine that in the business models that continue to evolve, like
food delivery, valuations are only based on negotiations based on the
Company's constant growth concerning new service lines and, therefore,
needs more funds..

The Amazon example

A successful loss-making startup can be seen through the case of Amazon,
which went for public floating in 1997 with a loss of $31 million. 

However, in 2001, it recorded its first profit as IPO, and by 2021-22 it
is predicted to create a wealth of $1.6 trillion for its shareholders.
Nonetheless, as private and deep-pocketed investors are driving
valuations, sustainable price discovery, which comes into play at the
pre-and post-IPO stages, is not happening, as observed in industrialised
nations like the US.

Consequently, high-valued companies are forced to slash their public
offering valuation, as happened with We Work's parent We Company. The
startup slashed the valuation of its public offering to nearly $20
billion, less than half the $47 billion valuations it attained in a
private funding round in 2019. 

Besides, the overly high valuation of ventures, as happened with Zomato
with 25x FY21 EV/Sales compared to an average of 9.6x for global peers
and 11.6x for Indian QSRs, might put both investors and the companies at
risk, since "valuing such early-stage businesses on plain vanilla
financial matrix might not give the right picture and may look
distorted." 

Last word

As some mega IPOs in the past, like homegrown SBI Card, GIC Re, NIA and
ICICI Prudential, could not deliver listing gains despite all the
excitement for one reason or the other. 

Similarly, on the international front, Quibi, Loon, Katerra, Essential
Products are some of the startup failures acquiring more than $100
million funding due to aggressive sales tactics, longer and riskier
commercial viability than predicted, and profits not meeting the
vision. 

Therefore, valuations of a startup, along with the optimistic
assumptions investors and the companies make about their growth and
wealth generation in the near future, should also be based on the
product, market size, team background, strategic relationship
/networking and existing investors background to avoid substantial cash
burn and devaluation.

Allow me to borrow a phrase from baseball for a moment. If you follow
the sport, you're likely aware of the concept of the "three true
outcomes." They are, specifically, a home run, a strikeout, and a walk.
The throughline between the three is that, in most instances, they're
not determined by the defense. There's gray area, of course, as is the
case with any attempt at defining an absolute.

There's also a longstanding question of how valuable the concept is, in
the forever cold war of baseball analysis. That's all fine, because I'm
mostly interested in co-opting the phrase here. Broadly speaking, the
three true outcomes for a robotics startup would be: As with the
baseball world, there's plenty of gray area to maneuver around in here.
In robotics, specifically, you can forever maintain a perfectly
successful company based on DARPA grants. Unlike baseball, it's possible
to do any combination of the above three, really. But the heart of the
question I'd like to get to here is this: What's the best outcome for a
robotics startup? No one wants number three, of course. But like
striking out, it's a very real - and disappointing - possibility. And as
we've seen, not even a tremendous influx of VC funding can prevent
startup failure entirely - especially in robots, where the barrier of
entry is so intensely high. And besides, robotics is overdue for a
little market correction in the face of macro trends. IPOing has been an
extremely rare outcome for robotics companies, even in the (now bygone)
golden era of SPACs. Given the state of the overall market, some planned
SPACs were put on hold in the interim, in hopes of riding more favorable
trends. Frankly, number two seems like a perfectly reasonable - and
often ideal - outcome for many firms. Robotics requires long runways and
a lot of resources that a big corporation can offer. Where you start to
run into trouble, however, is fit. I imagine conversations happen all
the time wherein the potential acquirer has a dramatically different
notion than the acquiree. We do see these bad fits from time to time, of
course. Maybe the company doesn't understand the market fit or
understand the resources that go into keeping a robotics firm afloat, or
maybe they just had wildly different notions of what their robots could
and couldn't do. For every Amazon buying Kiva, there's several Googles
buying Boston Dynamics. There were some question marks around Hyundai's
subsequent acquisition of the latter firm. A car company isn't the most
natural fit for what Boston Dynamics does, though I will say that this
week's announcement of the Boston Dynamics AI Institute is an
interesting - and promising - wrinkle to this story. Research has always
been a big piece of what the company does, and the new facility affords
the company a lot of runway and resources, backed by a $400 million
investment. That's several times what Ford recently invested in its own
U of M facility. Most intriguing of all, BD's founder and former CEO,
Marc Raibert, will be heading up the institute. "Our mission is to
create future generations of advanced robots and intelligent machines
that are smarter, more agile, perceptive and safer than anything that
exists today," he said in a release tied to the news. "The unique
structure of the Institute - top talent focused on fundamental solutions
with sustained funding and excellent technical support - will help us
create robots that are easier to use, more productive, able to perform a
wider variety of tasks, and that are safer working with people."
Following Google's bungling of the acquisition (and a number of others
around the same time, under Andy Rubin's purview), it's worth a check-in
to see how the firm's efforts in the category are going. My coverage of
the space has largely revolved around Alphabet X graduates. Most
prominent (thus far) is drone delivery service Wing, though we're
starting to see interesting work out of robotics software firm
Intrinsic. Last year, we also gave some column space to Smarty Pants, a
promising soft robotic exoskeleton being developed by the lab. In March,
the lab also offered a preview of Project Mineral, an autonomous rover
designed to collect crop data. Specifically, it's working to phenotype
plants. The company writes: Slightly jealous that Haje got to pay
Google's in-house robotics efforts a visit this week. He wrote about the
experience, which involves some work being done with fellow X graduate.
He explains: All told, I think there's a case to be made here for
developing robotics and AI companies in-house - of course, very few
firms possess the resources of an Alphabet/Google. And even with
Google's time, money and patience, we're a ways away from seeing how
such pursuits might actually pay off. Meanwhile, Xiaomi's efforts are a
massive question mark. Thus far, the company's robotics work looks more
akin to Samsung. Beyond some success with robotic vacuums, I don't have
much reason to believe its work is more than show at the moment. That
includes last year's Spot-like CyberDog and CyberOne, a new humanoid
robot that debuted alongside some phones. From a design standpoint, it's
clear why the robot is being compared to Tesla's thus-far-unseen
efforts. It also gives a more...realistic expectation of what to
anticipate from such a bipedal robot. Before I leave you for the week,
here is some funding news from an interesting startup: YC-backed Mobot
just raised a $12.5 million Series A. The company creates robots
designed to help developers test apps for issues. "There are tools
developed by companies like Applitools, Test.ai and others that leverage
existing emulated testing frameworks to automate testing for mobile
apps. However, the unfortunate reality is that many defects often slip
through the cracks of software-based, emulated testing because it
doesn't accurately represent testing on real hardware," founder Eden
Full Goh tells TechCrunch. "Presently, Mobot is not positioning
ourselves as a competitor or replacement for emulators and automated
testing. Rather, our goal is to replace the inevitable manual quality
assurance that everyone is still having to do and will increasingly have
to do as device fragmentation grows in the next five to ten years."
Meanwhile, I had an exclusive from CleanRobotics, the Colorado-based
firm behind the waste-sorting robotic trash receptacle TrashBot. The
company raised a $4.5 million Series A to scale out a robot designed to
improve recycling sorting at the source. "Recycling rules are confusing
and consumers are often so confused that their recycling accuracy is
less than chance, leading to highly contaminated recyclables, which no
one is buying," CEO Charles Yhap notes. "Our system improves material
diversion from landfills, resulting in more recyclables and less waste."

WeWork files lawsuit against SoftBank for terminating tender offer

The dispute between WeWork and SoftBank Group has turned for the worse
with the former filing a lawsuit against its largest shareholder.

The We Company, the owner of WeWork, has sued SoftBank Group challenging
its decision to terminate a $3 billion offer into the real estate office
sharing company, according to a report in Reuters and other media
outlets.

The lawsuit was filed on the grounds that SoftBank had breached its
contractual obligations by abandoning its tender offer.

"The Special Committee regrets the fact that SoftBank continues to put
its own interests ahead of those of WeWork's minority stockholders," it
said in the lawsuit filed in the Chancery Court of Delaware, according
to a Reuters report.

SoftBank had originally made the tender offer to buy shares of WeWork at
an agreed-upon price last year as part of a package to bail out the
company after its failed IPO. The money would've gone to current and
former employee shareholders, outside shareholders, and ousted CEO and
Co-founder Adam Neumann.

However, SoftBank said it terminated the proposed tender offer for
additional WeWork shares, citing criminal and civil probes into the
startup, its failure to restructure a joint venture in China, and the
impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

For WeWork, it has been a double whammy of sorts from both its internal
business challenges and external environment due to the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic.

It has been hit particularly hard by the outbreak, as its occupancy
rates have plunged over the past month and its largest clients have been
forced to vacate.

WeWork has plummeted from the levels of being counted as a leading
unicorn globally and now struggling to raise funds. WeWork was set on a
downward spiral after filing itsIPO prospectuslast year, which revealed
a $900 million loss over six months and questionable corporate
governance practices.

SoftBank became its largest shareholder after pumping in a considerable
amount of money which is estimated to be about $10 billion.

In October last year, WeWork had formed a two-member special committee
to help negotiate a financing lifeline from SoftBank and its main lender
JPMorgan Chase & Co.

 September 11 -- The HPCC has accused the Jai Ram government of creating
regional imbalance in development projects.

Ajay Mahajan, state general secretary of the HPCC and former Nurpur MLA,
in a press conference said here today that Rs 1,220-crore World
Bank-funded Horticulture Development Project, meant for 12 districts of
the state, was the tip of the iceberg. Kangra, Hamirpur, Bilaspur and
Una districts were ignored.

He said the project was approved in 2014 and the agreement signed in
October 2016 during the stint of the previous Virbhadra government, but
the BJP government had discriminated against Kangra district and lower
areas.

Criticising the state government for shifting office of the
Engineer-in-Chief from Fatehpur (Kangra) to Mandi, Mahajan said the
office had opened during the previous Congress regime for accelerating
the ongoing work on Shah Nehar, Sidhatha and Phina Singh irrigation
projects in Kangra areas.

 

"A Rs 800-crore project, under BRICS funding, was sanctioned during the
Congress regime for IPH schemes, but this government is spending 80 per
cent of the funds only in two Assembly constituencies in Mandi district
alone, whereas 20 per cent budget is being spent in rest of the state,"
he alleged.

He lambasted the state government for its failure to take up the issue
of starting work on a number of new national highways and
Pathankot-Mandi fourlane projects which had been announced by the Modi
government with fanfare.

Mahajan alleged that the government had not only closed working office
of the World Bank-funded Mid-Himalyan Development Project (phase-3) from
Nurpur, but also shifted its regional office from Dharamsala to Solan
despite public announcement of the Chief Minister at Nagrota Bagwan for
shifting head office of the project from Solan to Dharamsala.

'Why I Stopped Wearing My Socks' Will Ignite The Entrepreneurial Spark
Within You (Book Review)

Author Alok Kejriwal is the founder of Games2Win. His previous startup
Mobile2win was acquired by Walt Disney.

So, what exactly is entrepreneurship?

A desire to become a millionaire? A wish to change this world? A plan to
break free from corporate slavery?

As per various estimates, more than 90% of startups fail in first 3
years of its existence, and if we do a quick analysis of the reasons,
then one big reason would be: Lack of clarity.

Alok Kejriwal's first book: Why I Stopped Wearing My Socks is one such
elixir, which will help you to decode this 'Why'. This book can force
you to go to the deepest chambers of your heart and mind, and discover
that Why behind your insane, crazy dreams.

To start with, this book tells us that the entrepreneur should be ready
to devote 10 years to his/her venture, and experience failures first
hand, in order to understand what success actually is.

And once you realize the logic behind this thought, then you will also
realize why 90% of startups fail within 3 years of its existence.

As I devoured this book and thought hard about the invaluable lessons
and stories shared by Alok, then it became crystal clear: This book has
the magical power to ignite the entrepreneurial spark within you. Not
only ignite, but also sustain that spark until it becomes raging flames.

Here are 5 reasons why every dreamer should read this book:

Crispy, Mesmerizing Stories & Lessons

Alok Kejriwal, author of this immensely interesting book is a startup
legend in his own rights.

The short stories behind his quitting family owned business, launching a
contest-focussed startup and then selling it to Disney in China, then
again launching new gaming startup (which will soon file for an IPO) in
India showcases the hustle and patience of an entrepreneur, making it a
mesmerizing read.

In fact, this is a brilliant chance to peek into the mind of an
entrepreneur, wants to make a dent in the Universe.

No, there aren't any hardcore moral lessons here, but short, crispy
stories which teach you way more than an MBA degree ever can. As I
realized very soon, this book has the potential to become a powerhouse
of energy and inspiration, for the budding entrepreneur.

The Ultimate Test Of Your Passion

So, how passionate are you? Can you leave behind everything you have, in
order to achieve everything you desired? Can you say no to the safe
comfort zone and push yourself hard, harder to challenge the status quo?

"Why I Stopped Wearing My Socks" will act as a mirror, and force you to
reflect hard into it, asking the very purpose of your passion.

Did you know that sitting and observing in a factory for hours can teach
you some of the biggest lessons of entrepreneurship and life? If no,
then this book is for you!

Business & Life Ethics Are The Pillars

Ethics is an important, vital part of not only business but also life.
WIthout ethics, this whole journey becomes suffering, plagued by guilts,
mistakes and blunders. Once you finish the short chapters of this book
and see the world from the eyes of Alok Kejriwal, you will realize the
importance of ethics in business and in life.

Right from an ONGC Inspector to a Venture Capitalist, Alok has received
interesting, and viable ethical teachings, which has been shared in the
book. The mistakes, the errors made and the faulted worldview of Alok
has been told as they were, and this makes the reading even more
fascinating.

This is what Alok says, "I would urge everyone reading this to never
compromise on morals and ethics, no matter what the situation maybe. If
you are confused, your conscience will always point you in the right
direction."

Embracing Failure & Refusing To Accept Defeat

It is said that failure is the default state of a startup. But when
actual failure hits you hard, onto your face, then every logic seem to
evaporate.

In this book, Alok has shared some intimate, very real and very touching
stories of failure which should be read by every entrepreneur who thinks
that starting a business is a cakewalk.

You will feel your heart pounding and blood rushing as Alok shares
desperate times when his company didn't have enough funds to pay
salaries, and his company was on the brink of closure. When internal
politics played havoc with his company's morale and when investors
ditched him, right when they were expected to help.

Once you complete this book, you will understand why embracing failure
and refusing to accept defeat makes or breaks the entrepreneur.

Understanding The 'Why'

As mentioned at the beginning of this review, that lack of clarity can
destroy the morale of any entrepreneur and demolishes his/her dream.

On the same hand, as the book states, having clarity and the answer to
'Why' will help you to overcome every conceivable defeat and obstacle.

Why ethics in business is important, why following your passion is
important than being in your comfort zone, why meeting at least 3 new
people everyday can make you confident, why asking questions (even
stupid ones) can force people to notice you, why sales is a skill which
every entrepreneur should learn, why exiting a business at the right
time is important, why 10 years of patience and perseverance is crucial
and answers to more such Whys can be found in this book.

If someone asks me to highlight the biggest lesson of this book, then it
will be a line told by Alok's father when he shared that he wants to
quit the family owned business and stop wearing socks: "Just remember to
be patient, because everything starts small."

ABSTRACT

Purpose

Context impacts the design and practice of entrepreneurship education,
but there is limited focus on context in entrepreneurship education
literature. The purpose of this paper is to review the entrepreneurship
education literature to understand how context has been addressed,
derives contextual elements from prioritized literature and explores how
context can be adapted to and designed with in entrepreneurship
education.

Design/methodology/approach

A systematic literature review is undertaken to explore context in
entrepreneurship education literature. Context entrepreneurship
education yielded 239 items. After refinement, 232 entrepreneurship
education associated publications were reviewed by the team of authors.
Using selection criteria, 26 prioritized publications were analyzed and
categorized according to a theoretical framework.

Findings

Context has been addressed both conceptually and empirically,
quantitatively and qualitatively, and can be categorized across three
sociological phenomena levels → micro, meso and macro. Within these
levels, more specific context elements emerge from the entrepreneurship
education literature. The findings assert that while context is highly
influential in relation to entrepreneurship education, it is arbitrarily
described, and holds a variety of documented and diffuse elements.
Educators have a limited span of control in relation to context
elements, however, for the most parts elements can be adapted to or
designed with. Finally, due to the influence of context it is difficult
to identify a universal best practice of entrepreneurship education
because there simply is no ceteris paribus.

Research limitations/implications

Contextual elements which emerged from the literature consider various
subjects, spaces, structures and networks. Context is complex and has
had limited treatment in entrepreneurship education literature, thus
additional analysis and experimentation is necessary.

Practical implications

Context shapes understanding and influences learning. Addressing
entrepreneurship education across three levels → micro, meso and macro →
and through four framing questions → who, what, where and when → guides
educators in how context influences and can be used when designing
education.

Originality/value

The paper gives new insight into how context is addressed in
entrepreneurship education literature, and how this can influence
educational design.

Introduction

Context is intuitively recognized and theoretical argued as important to
entrepreneurship (Welter, 2011; Welter et al., 2016). However, there is
less agreement on what constitutes context, as it can be conceptualized
at several levels and through various elements (Zahra et al., 2014).
Entrepreneurship research has argued for organization of context across
five categories (Goodman and Whetten, 1998; Welter, 2011) → historical,
temporal, institutional, spatial and social. These categories are
evident across the comprehensive spectrum of literature over the past 50
years, for example, illustrating links between national, regional and
institutional culture and entrepreneurial potential (Autio et al., 2014;
Mueller and Thomas, 2001; Shrivastava and Kennelly, 2013),
entrepreneurial activity influenced by spatial conditions and local,
social and economic milieu (Garofoli, 1994; Muñoz and Cohen, 2017),
temporal interplay of context and action (Moroz and Hindle, 2011;
Solymossy and Hisrich, 2000) or opportunity as conditioned by the
entrepreneurs’ interaction with their context (Gartner, 1985) and role
in the social structure (Greenwood and Suddaby, 2006; Jack and Anderson,
2002).

Accepting that context matters to entrepreneurship because of
interdependencies based upon interaction between the context and the
entrepreneur (Welter et al., 2016), we need to better understand how
context is dealt with when supporting entrepreneurial competence
development. Thus, it seems odd that relatively little attention is
given to context when designing entrepreneurial pedagogy and teaching
entrepreneurship (Neergaard and Christensen, 2017). In this paper, we
take a more stringent look at the literature to investigate how context
has been addressed in entrepreneurship education, emphasizing work which
positions context as a central focus rather than a peripheral
contingency. We emphasize a pedagogical perspective in our analysis and
conceptual implications.

One could argue that in algebra, for a given problem there is a right
equation and there is a right answer, such that while what is learned is
not dependent on where you are or who you are, but how it is learned is
contextually dependent. Using theory of socially situated activity, Lave
(2009) states that “decontextualized learning activity is a
contradiction in terms” (p. 231). Lave argues for the relevance of
context elements when designing and delivering education. In regard to
entrepreneurship education, both what is learned and how it is learned
is contextually dependent. There is no ceteris paribus (all other things
being equal) in entrepreneurship education due to the complex multitude
of variables that equate to a high degree of context dependency.
Entrepreneurship education relies on experience and storytelling, rather
than structured proofs, formulas or equations. For this reason,
entrepreneurship education needs a contextualized perspective. As the
tools of how to be or become entrepreneurial are not complete,
entrepreneurship education needs context which is scaffolded (Neergaard
and Christensen, 2017; Williams Middleton and Donnellon, 2014).
Accordingly, we need to pay attention to context-specific aspects, when
we design entrepreneurship education. It can be argued that not only
context does matter (Barab and Plucker, 2002), but also it is
foundational to any learning which is intended to be situated in
practice, as it weaves together a multitude of factors influencing the
learning processes that takes place (Cope, 2005).

This is particularly important as entrepreneurship education has seen a
significant increase in the past decades (Kuratko, 2003; Nabi et al.,
2017), with increasing attention on learning designed for gaining
experience and preparing for practice (Lackéus et al., 2016; Robinson et
al., 2016). Therefore, it would seem obvious that context constitutes a
central theme for entrepreneurship education (and associated research).
Yet, context as a variable has received scant specific attention in the
entrepreneurship education literature, in comparison to the field in
general (Welter, 2011; Welter et al., 2016), even though Walter and
Dohse (2012) suggest that different results in relation to the impact of
entrepreneurship education can be explained by differences in mode and
setting of education. Blenker et al. (2014) underline the importance of
being explicit about context in research within entrepreneurship
education because it will enable comparison of studies, qualify the
field and guide applicability. These arguments suggest that that the
impact of context necessitates a pedagogic innovation. A better
understanding of context in entrepreneurship education allows for a
shift from addressing context solely as a setting we adhere to include
context treated as a dynamic space that can be designed with.

In this paper, we review the existing literature addressing context in
entrepreneurship education in order develop a more clear and
comprehensive understanding of context as an educational design
parameter. Knowing what constitutes context will enable educators to
design with context, rather than in a context or devoid of context. We
argue that it is important to be conscious of and attentive to context
in entrepreneurship education, as context imprints preconceptions on the
actors in the educational design → namely, the educators, students and
practitioners → and also influences opportunities. In order to design
with context, we therefore need to ask the following research questions:
RQ1. What constitutes context in entrepreneurship education? RQ2. How
can entrepreneurship education be developed with context as a design
parameter?

The paper proceeds as follows. First, to premise the literature review,
we provide an overview of how entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship
education literature have been reviewed previously. We then present the
methodological approach utilized to review literature for the purpose of
this paper, addressing context and entrepreneurship education (through
different keyword pairings). Insights from the review are then presented
and discussed, culminating in suggestions for how these may inform
entrepreneurship education design (and practice). Implications highlight
the need for a conceptual framework which is aimed to raise awareness of
context in entrepreneurship education, design and practice. The
investigation points to areas for future theoretical development in
entrepreneurship education research with regard to context, and
practical implications suggest ways in which educators may make informed
choices when designing with context in entrepreneurship education.

Key issues from entrepreneurship education literature reviews

Entrepreneurship education has been the subject of review studies for
over two decades, with the journal Education and Training in particular
providing a main forum (see e.g. Blenker et al., 2014; Henry and Lewis,
2018; Matlay, 2006; Matlay and Carey, 2007; Mwasalwiba, 2010). Context
or contextualization has often been raised as an influential variable
during these review studies. Context in these reviews have included both
human and non-human actors (Latour, 2005) constituting the who, what,
where and when of entrepreneurship educational context, henceforward
described as context elements. The context elements addressed in the
reviews can be divided across three sociological phenomena levels: the
macro level, which are national context elements; the meso level that
are regional and university specific context elements; and finally the
micro level, which are the course specific elements. The earliest review
(Gorman et al., 1997) capturing the ten previous years stresses the need
for further studies on educational content and markets for education. In
relation to context, these reviews draw attention to expanding
multiplicity, both in terms of expansion across different university
(ex. meso) and country (ex. macro) settings (Matlay, 2006), disciplines
(ex. meso) and educational objectives, methods, content and assessment
practice (ex. micro) (Mwasalwiba, 2010). Blenker et al. (2014) address
methodology issues, seeking an integrative framework to try and improve
how entrepreneurship is researched, aiming for better generalizability
across contexts. Henry and Lewis (2018) provide a systematic review of
previous entrepreneurship education reviews, noting once again that
there is still a lack of generalizability in entrepreneurship education
research not only because of limited conceptualisation and small
samples, but also because of the range of different contexts: geographic
institutional and programmes (again exemplifying macro, meso and micro
levels). Naia et al. (2014, 2015) further found that best practices
could be identified for a speciﬁc context, but there is no evidence that
these practices could be extended to provide a universal approach.
Similarly, theoretical grounding was contingent to the study context.
Overall, the reviews emphasize key issues of concern in terms of
weaknesses in methodology and theorization that undermines
generalizability.

It is perhaps surprising that no review has positioned context as the
main variable towards understanding entrepreneurship education, or
recognized context as a design parameter, given the established
connection between student intentionality, policy and context, for
example, argued for by Pittaway and Cope (2007). Yet 10 years later,
Longva and Foss (2018) still found that impact studies are marred by
weakly understood linkages to context. Reviews of entrepreneurship
education literature thus unveil two main concerns regarding context.
One is the limitation and generalization in research due to contextual
differences between studies. The other is the lack of progress in
understanding context in relation to entrepreneurship education, both
theoretically and in practice.

Methodological approach

To answer RQ1 a systematic literature review collects all the different
current perspectives on context, which inform the construction of a
holistic understanding of context. A systematic literature review
approach provides a stringent and prescribed methodology that allows
researchers to make sense of large bodies of information (Petticrew and
Roberts, 2006). This approach enables not only an overview of the
literature but addresses what works and what does not. In this paper,
the literature review is used to identify the partial and arbitrary
descriptions of context in the current body of literature to inform an
overarching understanding of the phenomena, putting together the pieces
of the puzzle. In line with previous relevant systematic literature
reviews (Henry and Lewis, 2018; Mwasalwiba, 2010; Tranfield et al.,
2003), our design used a multiple keyword search to independently
identify literature, followed by staged analysis to classify
publications according to first general and then more specific criteria,
while not excluding work based on methodological type.

A keyword search was conducted in the Scopus database in order to
identify areas of overlap, as well as potential gaps in the literature,
specifically peer-reviewed publications in books and journals. The
keyword search utilized “Entrepreneurship Education” AND “Context”,
resulting in 239 articles, published between 1 January 1993 and 24
August 2017. The large majority (172 of 217) were published in 2010 or
later. Seven publications from the initial search were excluded as they
were not about higher education, published in a journal or book, or in
English. This resulted in 232 remaining publications that were
systematically reviewed by the authors of this paper. To capture initial
key perspectives and current trends, a brief analysis of the 20 most
cited publications as well as the 10 most recently published items was
conducted (four articles published in 2017 and six articles published in
2016). This preliminary analysis informed the framework used for
reviewing all the publications.

Two main filters were utilized to review the literature. First the
literature was grouped into different classifications. Literature where
context issues in entrepreneurship education were the central focus and
relating to the aim of the piece were classified as “Main”. Literature
which has sections focusing on context issues in entrepreneurship
education, but not having context as the dominant argument were
classified as “Sectional”. Literature with only minor or brief mention
of context in entrepreneurship education was classified as “Minor”. In
total, 26 publications fell into the classification “Main focus” and
thus were positioned as prioritized literature.

The second filter addressed the sociological phenomena levels → macro,
meso and micro. These were also applied to the 26 “Main focus”
publications in order to identify context elements. Macro represents
national and international levels. Meso represents institutional
(university) and regional levels. Micro represents individual and small
group levels, as well as capturing more specific programme aspects.

In order to ensure a robust analysis, the remaining 206 publications
(“Sectional” and “Minor”) were analyzed for context elements using the
same sociological phenomena levels. Three additional elements were
identified, which are presented in the section Findings from non-“Main
focus” literature. Throughout the reviewing process, the authors
discussed classification to ensure consistency. As an additional
consistency check, 50 randomly selected publications from the entire 232
population were reviewed and compared by multiple authors. Across the 50
publications, the authors were found to be consistent with one another
in classification and analysis of context elements.

To understand how the contributions of the publications were developed,
each publication was identified as either conceptual or empirical, with
empirical sub-divided according to use of qualitative, quantitative or
mixed-based methodology. The implications of the conceptual or empirical
base of the reviewed publications are presented in Tables I and II with
associated discussions. The 26 publications representing the prioritized
literature, categorized into sociological levels with associated context
elements, are listed in Table III.

The prioritized literature was then evaluated using a theoretical
framework inspired by previous research (Goodman and Whetten, 1998; Jack
and Anderson, 2002; Welter, 2011) to distil into: content (what), agency
(who), positional (where) and temporal (when) aspects of context. The
framework builds upon Welter (2011) emphasis of using context from an
omnibus rather than discrete perspective, such that context is a lens
through which entrepreneurship is investigated, rather than considered
as a discrete variable. This perspective considers that positional and
temporal aspects operate on various levels. To address this, the
theoretical framework also incorporated the sociological phenomena
levels of macro, meso and micro with additional sub-level distinctions.

Findings from the literature review

When examining who is framing the discussion of context in
entrepreneurship education, one journal in particular, Education and
Training, is dominant. Given its position relative to review of
entrepreneurship education literature, it is not surprising that
Education and Training is the dominant forum of the published work (33
of the 232 published works) addressing context in entrepreneurship
education. The next 12 journals each published between three and nine
articles (see Table AI). Discussion about context in entrepreneurship
education did not commence until 1993. In comparison, context in
entrepreneurship in general has been debated in journals since 1970,
illustrating the difference in the maturity of the fields.

In the following, the findings from the literature review based on the
Scopus search on “Entrepreneurship Education” and “Context” are
presented.

Context in entrepreneurship education

There has been a steep increase of interest in the topic of context in
relation to entrepreneurship education during the last 10 years, which
is evidenced by increasing number of publications on the topic shown in
Figure 1.

Context has been researched as both a primary focus and as a sub-theme
using various methodological approaches. Table I illustrates the
methodological approach distribution of all 232 publications. In total,
85 of these were conceptually based, and 145 were empirically based. The
remaining two publications were identified as wide-ranging books. The
empirical publications therefore represent the majority of the
publications, and these were essentially evenly distributed as
quantitative (69) and qualitative (67). Nine of the empirical
publications applied mixed methods. No preferred methodology for
researching context in entrepreneurship education is therefore evident.

From the 232 publications, 26 were classified as “Main focus” and thus
considered the prioritized literature for the review. The prioritized
literature provides a more complex and nuanced picture of context in
entrepreneurship education. Similar to Table I the publications were
organized according to their methodological approach. In addition, they
were also organized at the sociological phenomena level, either as
addressing one level in particular or several levels (ex. micro + meso).
Table II illustrates the distribution of the prioritized literature in
terms of methodological approach and sociological phenomena level.

There is no discernible pattern when analyzing the methodology
distribution and sociological phenomena level of the prioritized
literature. In total, 9 of the 26 publications are conceptual; 17 are
empirical, where quantitative (9) publications are the most common,
followed by qualitative (5) and mixed method (3). In total, 16
publications address multiple levels while 10 publications focus on a
single level. Only two of the publications address the micro level
exclusively (and without any publications specifically addressing micro
level quantitative, or separately micro level qualitative), with
meso-level publications similarly uncommon (again with no qualitative
methodology). Table II also explicates that it is most common to address
context across all three levels and that this is not limited to any
particular methodological approach.

Context elements are most commonly described as fixed explanatory
factors: “the setting” of the entrepreneurship education or research.
Context from this perspective is something entrepreneurship education
and research is located in, not something that can be designed with or
in other ways utilized. While the literature states that context is
important and influential in entrepreneurship education, context and
context elements are either presented as documented items or using
diffuse language which varies significantly between the publications,
thus giving an arbitrary understanding of what context is. To gain a
cohesive understanding of what constitutes context in entrepreneurship
education, more examination is needed to understand the pieces relative
to one another. The following sections therefore present context
elements from the prioritized literature. In Table III, context is
addressed specifically in relation to three sociological phenomena
levels: macro, meso and micro.

Macro level

On the macro level, ten context elements are identified, as illustrated
in Table III. Geography is often used to explain a contextual setting.
For example, using data from Belgium, USA, China, India and Spain,
Giacomin et al. (2011) find that there are common factors of motivation
towards entrepreneurship, such as status, desire for independence and
personal development, but that the entrepreneurial intention of students
is influenced by their country/cultural background. Comparing political
and economic perspectives from Europe, the Middle East, North America
and India, Chauhan and Das (2016) investigate the entrepreneurship
activity of the population and differentiating factors driving
entrepreneurship education and training. Country setting is also widely
used as an explanatory factor that implicitly or explicitly accounts for
a number of other context elements such as: government policy, national
economy, labour market conditions, national culture and norms.

Government policy is indeed an influential context element. Policy can
promote entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education through positive
attention and resource allocation, or serve as a barrier through
complicated legislation, rigid bureaucracy and underfunding. In their
comparative study of the USA, Fiji, South Korea and China, Lee et al.
(2006) discuss how government promotion is an important influencing
factor on students’ attitude towards entrepreneurship, while in
Mozambique, underfunding was shown to be a main barrier to effective
entrepreneurship education (Libombo and Dinis, 2015). Government policy
is seen as influential through institutional economy (Guerrero et al.,
2014), which can amplify or hinder entrepreneurship education, including
preconditions. Similarly Anderson and Zhang (2015) illustrate the
differences in attention to entrepreneurship education support based on
embeddedness in a prioritized (or not) region within a socialist market
economy. Mwasalwiba et al. (2014) investigate the role entrepreneurship
education plays in the economic transition of Tanzania and the
associated influence and effects of policy and labour market. Balan-Vnuk
et al. (2014) advocate entrepreneurship education as critical in policy
making in Sri Lanka for inspiring sole proprietorship and desire to
promote self-sustained citizens. Garavan et al. (2010) emphasize
government policy as one of five dimensions influencing entrepreneurship
education in Ireland. Today this is a promoting factor, but in 1932
Ireland the policy of protectionism was not conductive to the emergence
of new venture creation, and arguably resulted in the distortion of the
economy.

National economic situation linked to policy is another context element
discussed in the prioritized literature (Anderson and Zhang, 2015;
Chauhan and Das, 2016; Giacomin et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2006). The
setting of entrepreneurship education in developing countries can serve
as both a barrier and a promoter for entrepreneurship and by extension
entrepreneurship education. Funding can be difficult to obtain but a
poor economy can serve as a motivational factor and catalyze
necessity-driven entrepreneurship (Balan-Vnuk et al., 2014), as a
restricted financial situation is shown to increase student motivation
and entrepreneurial intention, thus advocating entrepreneurship
education policy at a national scale. Garavan et al. (2010) categorize
economy as a second dimension that shapes entrepreneurship education by
affecting national policy.

Labour market conditions seem to influence student’s motivation for
entrepreneurship, as high levels of unemployment can be a strong
inspirational and motivational factor for entrepreneurship education.
This associates to both economic and government policy themes. Lee et
al. (2006) found that necessity increases entrepreneurial intent while
ease of obtaining employment decreases entrepreneurial intent. This
finding is echoed in Balan-Vnuk et al. (2014) and Mwasalwiba et al.
(2014) where entrepreneurship education is argued to promote
self-employment.

National culture and norms, while less tangible, emerge numerous times
in the prioritized literature. National values and the social and
cultural environment of countries are found to influence
entrepreneurship education (Anderson and Zhang, 2015; Chauhan and Das,
2016; García-Rodríguez et al., 2017). National culture is found to
explain differences in entrepreneurial intention of students, even when
common motivational factors (pursuit of profit/social status, desire for
independence, creation, personal development and professional
dissatisfaction) align across countries (Giacomin et al., 2011). Others
discuss the importance of social acceptance in regards to
entrepreneurial culture (Chauhan and Das, 2016; García-Rodríguez et al.,
2017), as lack of social acceptance and low practical ability has a
negative effect on students’ attitudes towards entrepreneurship (Lee et
al., 2006). Cultural dimensions, such as low power distance, weak
uncertainty avoidance, masculinity and individual achievement, are seen
to promote entrepreneurial action (Hofstede, 2001). Several pieces of
literature illustrate overarching cultural differences shaping the whole
educational system, including attitude towards entrepreneurship (Blenker
et al., 2008; Garavan et al., 2010; García-Rodríguez et al., 2017;
Gerba, 2012; Leitch et al., 2012). Blenker et al. (2008) contrast
wage-earner culture to entrepreneurial culture and argue for the
importance of institutional fit to intended culture development. And
while Garavan et al. (2010) emphasize the agricultural traditions in
rural Ireland impacting entrepreneurial attitudes, it is recognized that
national culture may have diminishing significance due to emerging
globalization.

Globalization and technical development trends are mentioned as
macro-level context elements that influence entrepreneurship education.
Arokiasamy (2012) investigates globalization trends as mediated through
government policy, and Thestrup and Robinson (2016) showcase how
advances in digitalization enable a new global connectivity and
scaffolding methods transcending all levels of context.

Meso level

In total, 16 publications are found to include context elements on the
meso level, further sub-divided into regional effects, university
specific elements and disciplinary effects. Similar to the macro level,
governance and economy are key themes at the meso level, but these are
now positioned within the region and institution. Culture and norms are
also confined to the institutional sphere at the meso level. Activities,
actors and networks are found more prominently at the meso level.

Regional effects, such as innovative activities, regional economy, and,
by extension, investment in research development and innovation, affect
the entrepreneurial intention of the regional population. Walter and
Dohse (2012) illustrate the degree of entrepreneurial activity within a
region can affect entrepreneurial learning, but that this is dependent
on the mode of education. Active modes of education are, irrespective of
the regional context, positively related to self-employment intentions,
whereas reflective modes of education raise self-employment intentions
only in regions with a high degree of entrepreneurial activity. The
positive effect on entrepreneurial learning happens between the
individual and the local context, emphasizing the importance of
embeddedness in active and innovative regions. Interstitial
organizations, specially run units at community colleges connecting
academics with private organizations such as incubators, are shown to
play an important role in developing entrepreneurial capacity in the
regional workforce (Mars and Ginter, 2012). Blenker et al. (2008) call
attention to general institutional (university) strategy in relation to
entrepreneurial activities in the regional environment and its
importance for entrepreneurship education, thus positioning the
university as a key contextual element in itself.

University-specific context is the most prominent element at the meso
level and is influenced by elements also found at the macro level;
namely, governance and economy. Government policy is a strong governing
mechanism in terms of educational funding and objective. Universities in
Malaysia benefit from government policy actively promoting
entrepreneurship education spurred by the trend of globalization
(Arokiasamy, 2012). Universities are similarly affected by the regional
governance and institutional economy. Guerrero et al. (2014) argued that
entrepreneurial universities either have or are positioned to develop
innovative pathways to reinforce entrepreneurship in their region; or
alternatively suffer from lack of government support to prioritize
resources to their region, given institutional rank (Anderson and Zhang,
2015). Additionally, university policy including institutional
governance and leadership, organizational culture, strategy and purpose,
and institutions’ approaches to the commercialization of research and
technology relating to the university and programme context (Garavan et
al., 2010) are all influential context elements framing entrepreneurship
education. Universities need to focus on entrepreneurship educational
design, in order to stimulate self-employment post university
(Mwasalwiba et al., 2014) as entrepreneurship education,
entrepreneurship support programmes and industry ties are all found to
have positive effect on student intention of self-employment (Walter et
al., 2013). Blenker et al. (2008) found that university age, history,
management, identity and norms are highly influential, as are networks
with other universities and between faculties within the university
itself, as these develop and promote entrepreneurship education and
support student extra-curricular activity, for example, via incubators.

Programme/disciplinary setting → like geography, disciplinary setting is
often used as an explanatory setting. Culture and norms are not only set
by the university, they can be further divided into discipline specific
sub-cultures. García-Rodríguez et al. (2017) found that university
environment inclusive of normative and cognitive development, directly
influences students’ attitudes, self-confidence and motivation, and
through these can affect entrepreneurial intention (Blenker et al.,
2008). Garavan et al. (2010), Maritz and Brown (2013) and Johnson et al.
(2006) all argue for a discipline-based framework for developing
entrepreneurial competence, in terms of profession-, industry- or
invention-based entrepreneurial ventures. For example, in a
developmental economy such as Tanzania (Gerba, 2012), entrepreneurship
education is mainly situated in certain disciplines, such as business
and agriculture, but this is reflected in the trajectory of
entrepreneurship education development in more established economies,
such as the USA (Solomon, 2007). Current policy (Bacigalupo et al.,
2016) and research (Kuratko and Morris, 2018) argue for application of
entrepreneurship to all disciplines, which, in turn, create a need for
development of academic staff. This leads to the micro-level context
elements.

Micro level

At the micro level, eight context elements are identified, with the
primary unit of study being actors and interactions. Not surprisingly
pedagogy and didactics are central themes in half of the publications.
The purpose or objective of the entrepreneurship education spans from
promoting new venture creation to stimulating enterprising behaviour in
general (Blenker et al., 2008; Maritz and Brown, 2013). Choice of
objective greatly influences the applied pedagogy, didactics and content
of any given course (Maritz and Brown, 2013; Neumeyer and McKenna,
2016). Applied pedagogy spans learning methods, models, approach and
didactics (Blenker et al., 2008; Chauhan and Das, 2016; Maritz and
Brown, 2013; Walter and Dohse, 2012), and while more advanced means,
such as experiential learning and reflexivity are advocated, they are
also recognized as challenging to design and deliver, calling attention
to issues of assessment (Maritz and Brown, 2013). Integrating these
issues, Maritz and Brown (2013) argue for adapting Alberti et al.’s
(2004) model to entrepreneurship education programmes in order to
holistically assess the why (objectives), what (content), how (pedagogy)
and for whom (audiences) in entrepreneurship education.

Because learning is socially situated (Lave, 2009) the actors involved
in the learning process, the students, the educators, external
stakeholders and social network, all carry significance. Student-related
context elements are extensive, including nationality, cultural heritage
and professional profile (Giacomin et al., 2011), preferred learning
style (Walter et al., 2010) and gender (Giacomin et al., 2011; Haddad et
al., 2016; Maritz and Brown, 2013). Haddad et al. (2016) question the
extent to which education accounts for gender stereotypes and how this
is or could be counteracted, through entrepreneurial self-efficacy.
Cultural heritage, gender and field of study all influence student
entrepreneurial intention, disposition and sensitivity to motivation and
perceived barriers for entrepreneurship (Giacomin et al., 2011), all of
which feeds back to determining how to design entrepreneurship education
to maximize learning outcome for the involved individuals.

Many context elements at the micro level originate outside the classroom
but are carried into the classroom by the students (Obrecht, 2016).
García-Rodríguez et al. (2017) found that the social context, including
family, exerts a weak direct influence on the perceived attitudes or
desire towards the option to start a business, and an indirect influence
on entrepreneurial intention. For example, Xie and Wang (2014)
emphasized individually based social and emotional aspects of learning
contributing to educational objectives, and others highlight individual
competence (Maritz and Brown, 2013) and social network (Walter et al.,
2010) as capital that students bring into the entrepreneurial learning
process. These context elements play a role in relation to
entrepreneurship education and are found to affect entrepreneurial
intent (García-Rodríguez et al., 2017), perception of entrepreneurial
capacity (Haddad et al., 2016) and entrepreneurial action (Guerrero et
al., 2014). The diversity of the student body (Maritz and Brown, 2013)
also affects the outcome in an entrepreneurial learning process.
Heterogeneity can spark creativity but also present itself as a barrier
for collaboration. Taken together, these context elements make it
difficult to generalize best practice without taking actor preferences
and preconditions into account, and this can expand from an individual,
to a team or interpersonal focus as well (Neumeyer and McKenna, 2016).

Not only are students important contextual carriers, but educators are
as well. Maritz and Brown (2013) acknowledge an educator’s knowledge,
skill and attitude as influential to receipt of entrepreneurship
education. Garavan et al. (2010) problematize educators’ lack of
experience while at the same time illustrates challenges faced when
linked to both universities and businesses. In addition, Libombo and
Dinis (2015) discuss challenges around pedagogic design and content and
identify main barriers as lack of resources, qualified teachers and
networks. Other external stakeholders, i.e. local business counsellors,
entrepreneurs, funding agencies and potential customers are also
included as influential actors in relation to entrepreneurship education
(Neumeyer and McKenna, 2016).

The micro contextual setting is addressed as a learning space (Haddad et
al., 2016) but it also includes online opportunities, such as educating
through blended learning (Chauhan and Das, 2016; Haddad et al., 2016;
Thestrup and Robinson, 2016). The final context element drawn from the
literature at the micro level is content (of courses,
syllabus/curriculum). Content is central in entrepreneurship education
(Garavan et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2006; Maritz and Brown, 2013) and
is addressed by approximately one-third of the prioritized literature.
Content is directly associated to the purpose of the education as it is
the baseline provision to support the learning objectives, as
exemplified in the Blenker et al. (2008) framework for developing
entrepreneurship education.

Cross-level observations

Central themes across sociological phenomena levels include political
and economic influences, geography, culture and development, activities,
networks, actors and interactions. Transitioning from the macro to the
micro level shifts focus from general policy to actors and interactions.
Culture is a transcending theme across national culture at the macro
level, institutional culture at the meso level and individual culture at
the micro level. A relatively new context element recognized on all
levels is digitalization (Thestrup and Robinson, 2016).

Additional context elements from non-“Main focus” publications

Analysis of literature in all three classifications (“Main”, “Sectional”
and “Minor”) presents a broad geographical spread, with 5 regions and 36
countries acting as “the setting” of the entrepreneurship education (see
Table AII). To ensure that no context elements were missed, the analysis
of the original 232 publications was revisited to scan for additional
elements that were discussed in publications with “Sectional focus on
context issues in entrepreneurship education” or “Brief mentioning of
context in entrepreneurship education”. Three additional elements were
identified.

Relating to the micro level, pedagogy and setting, simulation and gaming
(Newbery et al., 2016; Pavlova and Chernobuk, 2016) were considered as
the extension to scaffolding methods, enabling the educator to mediate
entrepreneurial experience through a controlled process. Relating to
focus in content and setting, Pittaway and Thorpe (2012) introduce
temporal business phases → pre-start-up, start-up, growth, crisis and
failure → to contextualization. Type of start-up is also presented as a
contextual setting (Zhang, 2015), with family businesses positioned as
having particular context elements as a type of start-up (Barrett, 2014;
Rautamäki and Römer-Paakkanen, 2016).

Not adding new levels or elements, five publications complimented the
discipline setting by elaborating upon which industry “one” is educated
for and in such as public sector (Adcroft et al., 2005), creative
industries (Carey and Matlay, 2010), engineering (Thongpravati et al.,
2016) or music (Noyes and Deligiannidis, 2012).

Benefits and challenges with integrating context in entrepreneurship
education

At all levels, context elements can either limit or enable
entrepreneurial activities, entrepreneurial opportunities and motivation
for becoming entrepreneurial (Welter, 2011), all essentially influencing
the prerequisites for entrepreneurship education. Preconceptions of
purpose, process and definitions are all shaped by context (Zahra et
al., 2014). Most educational designs are tailored by educators to move
the students towards the educators’ preconceptions, but if the gap
between the preconceptions of the educator and his or her students is
too large, it will be a very difficult task, and a challenging journey
for the students to take (if they even are open to doing so)
(Seikkula-Leino et al., 2010; Williams Middleton and Donnellon, 2014).

In relation to limiting or enabling students in entrepreneurship
educational processes, many context elements come into play. The
students’ background (Fayolle and Gailly, 2008; Walter et al., 2010) can
hold inspiration or necessity for entrepreneurial action, or on the
contrary, cause reluctance to engage in entrepreneurial action. Both
family (García-Rodríguez et al., 2017) and cultural background (Giacomin
et al., 2011) can also have an influence on entrepreneurial intent.
Moreover, social network (Walter et al., 2010) can be essential in
enabling entrepreneurship giving access to resources, but reference
groups can also have a negative influence on entrepreneurial attitude if
entrepreneurial action goes outside the social norms. In the course
setting, the fit between student’s preferred learning style (Walter and
Dohse, 2012) and the pedagogy and didactics applied in the course is
important in relation to the learning process. Furthermore in the
professional profile of the education (Giacomin et al., 2011) there can
be an necessity for entrepreneurial action related to future employment,
which can also be related to general labour market conditions (Lee et
al., 2006).

For educators many context elements influence the design process and the
execution of entrepreneurial educational processes. However, far from
all context elements are within the educator’s span of control and some
may even be difficult to predict. Indeed, contextualizing
entrepreneurship education calls for an individualistic approach because
there is no ceteris paribus in entrepreneurship education. At a
programme and university level, resources allocated to individual
courses, student number, scheduling flexibility and requirements for
assessment (Maritz and Brown, 2013) can have a great influence on
applied pedagogy and didactical design opportunities (Blenker et al.,
2008; Chauhan and Das, 2016; Maritz and Brown, 2013; Walter and Dohse,
2012). University culture and traditions can either support or hinder
entrepreneurial activities (Blenker et al., 2008). Similarly, regional
effects can also have a supportive or limiting impact on
entrepreneurship activities, as some regions provide strong support and
resources for entrepreneurial activities enabling inclusion of various
stakeholders (Neumeyer and McKenna, 2016), i.e. local business
counsellors, entrepreneurs, funding agencies and potential customers;
while others deprioritize one region or university for another (Anderson
and Zhang, 2015). Finally, educator network, knowledge, skills and
attitudes (Maritz and Brown, 2013) influence the educational process,
and much like the students, the educator’s background can either enable
or limit the entrepreneurial education process.

Welter (2011) and Zahra et al. (2014) identify temporal settings as an
important part of context. However, research in entrepreneurship, and
additionally entrepreneurship education, has not fully accounted for the
interdependency of temporal and other dimensions of context (Zahra et
al., 2014), and the potential influence on context elements, such as
policy and economies in transition (Libombo and Dinis, 2015; Mwasalwiba
et al., 2014). As evidenced by this review, accounting for temporal
settings while embedded in them continues to be a key challenge in
entrepreneurship research, but the benefit of increasing awareness of
this dimension may provide insight into trends and transitions
experienced in relation to other context elements.

Discussion

Drawing from the findings of the literature review, we put forth four
main assertions: context in entrepreneurship education is arbitrary;
context in entrepreneurship education is both documented and diffuse;
educators have a limited span of control in relation to context
elements; a lack of ceteris paribus in entrepreneurship education.

Context is everywhere and no-where. There is no general framework for
working with context in in entrepreneurship education, nor is there
existing research that covers all levels and context elements
simultaneously. Instead context in entrepreneurship education literature
is currently scoped to the interest or expertise of the author(s),
scoped by the frame or audience of the publication outlet, or limited by
the explanatory ability of the empirics. To comprehensively cover
context at all levels would demand large and coordinated efforts, with
access to proprietary and/or sensitive information and may be outside
current means. Our findings, consistent with previous research (e.g.
Zahra et al., 2014), also find that context is inherently tensioned,
which could limit the level of prescription a framework could provide.

Entrepreneurship education, including context elements, is increasingly
documented and empirically investigated through multiple forms of
policy, analysis, funding description, university and programme framing
and accreditation and university network peer evaluation, applied
pedagogy and didactics, content, etc. This is evidenced through the
ever-increasing publication of entrepreneurship education research,
introduction of new entrepreneurship education conferences and journals,
and government programmes, papers and reports. At the same time,
entrepreneurship education research is still predominantly descriptive,
building upon cases and storytelling (Johannisson, 2016) because of the
complex matrix of variables that shape the learning experience, which,
to be entrepreneurial, is fundamentally situated relative to
uncertainty. There are even attempts to document the contextual
influence of culture (Giacomin et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2006), but
social interactions, personal heritage and preference are still diffuse,
while at the same time highly influential context elements.

With the increasing complexity of education and the educator’s span of
control in relation to context elements is further limited. Developments
of online learning, MOOCs, flipped classroom, etc. mean that the
learning space is no longer confined and thus ability to control and
stabilize influential variables is reduced (Lackéus and Williams
Middleton, 2018). At the same time, there are often clear guidelines in
terms of time, credit points, learning objectives, physical
interactions, etc. that allow the educator to define and make decisions
upon what and how is taught and with whom the students interact. This
perhaps indicates a shift from an educator’s responsibility of
distributing knowledge and what to think, to educators as facilitators
of tools to think with → tools that frame learning and sensemaking.

These insights lead to the conclusion that there is no real ceteris
paribus in entrepreneurship education. Recognizing that context matters
are accepting that everything else is not equal. The importance of
context in entrepreneurship education is well established, but, as has
been shown, context has rarely been the central focus but has rather
been addressed as an influencing element, and thus context elements have
not been systematically transferred into research addressing how
educators can actively design with context in mind. As Welter et al.
(2016) argue, a contextualized understanding questions our tendency for
an “all-are-alike” approach. Thus, while context creates a
generalization dilemma, we can generalize how we frame context through
elements (Table III) and a conceptual framework (Table IV). If we
approach context from two perspectives, as a lens (omnibus) and as a
(discrete) variable (Welter, 2011), we argue that educators can make
better educational designs by raising their contextual awareness,
understanding of which context elements can be designed with or
otherwise influenced proactively, and which context elements are those
to which educational design must adhere. Educators therefore need to
make sense of the “who, what, where and when” (Welter, 2011) of context
to strengthen the student’s learning process in entrepreneurship
education. Next, we use findings from the literature review and
identified context elements to present a conceptual framework.

Making sense of context in entrepreneurship education

To operationalize context in relation to entrepreneurship education,
Table IV provides questions for educators interested in designing with
context when developing their learning processes. Some context elements
will be within the educator’s span of control and can therefore be
applied directly into the educational design and delivery. Other context
elements are outside the span of control and may therefore constitute
“framing factors” to which educators must adhere, adapt or slowly adjust
over time. In either case, part of the educator’s role in
entrepreneurship education is as a mediator of context for the students
in their learning process.

Table IV presents context elements at the macro, meso and micro levels,
with additional level distinction stemming from the prominent themes
identified through the literature analysis. The macro level is divided
into a national and international level, as policy and economics
associated to education are often governed through national and
international guidelines. The meso level is constituted by the programme
and university as institutional contexts and the local regional context.
The micro level is the course level, the classroom. The questions asked
at the different levels are relating to the context elements of who,
what, where and when.

As Table IV suggests, working with “who” at all levels will help
identify relevant stakeholders and gatekeepers. In the literature this
is mostly discussed at the micro level, where students (Blenker et al.,
2008; García-Rodríguez et al., 2017; Giacomin et al., 2011; Guerrero et
al., 2014; Haddad et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2006; Maritz and Brown,
2013; Walter et al., 2010), educators (Maritz and Brown, 2013) and
related stakeholders (Neumeyer and McKenna, 2016) are presented as key
actors. Understanding the “who” can enable expedient networking, while
also promoting awareness and understanding of the potentially complex
mix of actors, with diverse cultural heritages, involved in an
entrepreneurial learning process. Such an understanding may support
successful interaction.

It may seem obvious, but the “what” simply concerns the capture and
presentation of descriptive phenomena in relation to entrepreneurship
education, at all levels. This facilitates understanding in regard to
activities, content, resources and process, in order to guide actors
involved in terms of what they can participate in and what they need to
do.

Much of the literature identifies “where” as a setting and explanatory
factor their research and findings. The “where” on the macro level is
the country specific context (Blenker et al., 2008; Garavan et al.,
2010; García-Rodríguez et al., 2017; Gerba, 2012; Leitch et al., 2012),
that uses explanatory factors as political governance (Anderson and
Zhang, 2015; Balan-Vnuk et al., 2014; Blenker et al., 2008; Guerrero et
al., 2014; Lee et al., 2006; Mwasalwiba et al., 2014), economy (Anderson
and Zhang, 2015; Balan-Vnuk et al., 2014; Blenker et al., 2008; Guerrero
et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2006; Mwasalwiba et al., 2014) and culture
(Anderson and Zhang, 2015; Blenker et al., 2008; Chauhan and Das, 2016;
Garavan et al., 2010; García-Rodríguez et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2006)
to describe the entrepreneurial environment. At the meso level the
university setting is primarily described as an influential context
element (Arokiasamy, 2012; Blenker et al., 2008; García-Rodríguez et
al., 2017; Gerba, 2012; Guerrero et al., 2014; Haddad et al., 2016; Mars
and Ginter, 2012; Walter and Dohse, 2012; Walter et al., 2013). The
“where” is most often described as a setting, providing frames that
either hamper or promote entrepreneurship education and as something
educators must navigate within.

Finally, the “when” of context is understood as the period in which the
entrepreneurship education takes place, but also the frequency and
longevity of the education. This dimension is not significantly
described in the literature, but rather related to the political and
economic themes in terms of, for example, the timeframe of a
transitional economy (Lee et al., 2006). However, it may be quite
important in terms of deciding when we should teach whom what, as one
size does not fit all (Blenker et al., 2012).

Not all context elements may be relevant to consider for every
educational design. Some elements can be proactively designed by the
educator, while other elements are out of the span of control and must
be considered as fixed framing elements that the educator reactively
adheres to, with potential to perhaps change over time, depending upon
institutional or other legitimizing support.

Conclusions and implications

In this paper, a systematic literature review was conducted to answer
the question: “what constitutes context in entrepreneurship education?”
Analysis found that context in entrepreneurship education can be
described at multiple levels and be categorized in relation to multiple
elements. As suggested in in Table III, context elements can be
identified across three levels, macro, meso and micro. These findings
align with previous research addressing context in entrepreneurship
literature in general (Welter, 2011). More specifically, key themes were
identified which prioritized context elements at the different levels,
such as country/national description at the macro level, university at
the meso level and student/student activities at the micro level. Given
that context is a complex phenomenon, structuring the perspective
through sociological phenomena levels and in relation to the “who, what,
where and when” frame enables researchers and practitioners to better
identify and address the constituting elements.

To address the RQ2 context elements were framed with the categorization
of content (what), agency (who), positional (where) and temporal (when)
distilled from established frameworks (Goodman and Whetten, 1998; Jack
and Anderson, 2002; Welter, 2011) and resulting in Table IV. The
framework provides educators with questions to guide the designing of
education with context. While this framework illustrates ways in which
context can influence or is influenced by entrepreneurship in an
educational setting, not all elements will be relevant for every
educational design, and it is yet to be empirically tested. Nonetheless,
the analysis and resulting framework emphasizes the importance of
consciously working with context elements in relation to educational
design, providing options for proactive rather than reactive engagement.
This enables educators and students to better become “pilots”
(Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005) in their learning and entrepreneurial
processes, such that they can better identify, understand and use the
context elements from and in their educational setting.

The practical implication is a guideline for design of entrepreneurship
education programmes and courses that take context elements into
consideration. This includes awareness of applicability of certain
context elements to education approaches. Some elements may align
naturally with a “learning through” approach (Neck and Greene, 2011;
Ollila and Williams-Middleton, 2011; Pittaway and Thorpe, 2012), just as
“learning about” naturally limits contextual richness, but may be allows
for macro level perspectives (what is entrepreneurship in economics,
what is entrepreneurship in sociology and what impact do national and
international markets have on entrepreneurship, historically and
currently), etc. These may be definitional elements in “about”, whereas
they are more experiential elements in the “in” or “through”.

Entrepreneurship education is a global phenomenon (see Table AII),
recognized by governments practitioners alike for its importance in
contributing to growth and value creation (Kaufmann, 2009).
Entrepreneurship education is gaining increased scholarly attention
(Nabi et al., 2017) and is still emerging in many regions, as
exemplified by Figure 1. This signals the importance of introducing a
framework for defining and working with context in entrepreneurship
education, to support comparative analysis and continued research
development.

A key aim of the paper has been to increase insight and awareness
regarding potential knowledge gaps between the entrepreneurial
experience, as addressed in general entrepreneurship literature, and the
use of different types of education to inspire and prepare students for
entrepreneurial practice, or to learn more about entrepreneurship.
However, there are still several unanswered questions regarding context
in entrepreneurship education, which need to be put on the
entrepreneurship education research agenda: what are common means for
designing with context? And to what extent are micro and meso context
elements driven by macro level elements? As the current dialogue about
context in entrepreneurship education was shown to be limited to
predominantly one journal, a broader exposure would enrich the research
in this field. Qualifying contextualization of entrepreneurship
education in research enables a shift from arbitrary single case studies
towards an understanding of how to generalize when taking context into
account. This positions entrepreneurship educators as a key audience for
this work, but there are additional practitioners to consider:
university leaders, educators in other disciplines, collaboration
partners or acting entrepreneurs that are engaged in the learning
spaces.

We have aimed to call attention to the importance of context in
entrepreneurship education. Table III provides a tool to decipher how
context has been treated in entrepreneurship education theory and
through the three levels of categorization making it more navigable. In
extension, the benefits and challenges with integrating context in
entrepreneurship education are addressed. With Table IV, educators are
given a framework to make sense of their specific context. The framework
provides a holistic view of context and educators are then left with the
choice of which context elements are relevant for them to design with.
Next steps include determining means to test and validate the framework.
The “interactive” structure is intended to provide more descriptive
rather than definitional framing. Over time, qualification and
meta-analysis from the research community as well as practitioners in
the field is required to gain and validate additional insights.

Attributes of a robust startup team

The success or otherwise of a startup rests on its founding team. A
shared vision, passion, domain expertise, a can-do attitude and ability
to multi-task are some of the traits that make for a robust startup
team.

Over the years, studies have revealed that 23 percent of startup
failures are attributed to an inadept startup team. Building a strong
startup team, therefore, is the most important task founders face in
launching a successful startup and securing investor funding.

Investors almost always don't invest in ideas; they invest in founding
startup teams, even if that "team" happens to be just one or two
persons. An inept founding team can ensure that even the most innovative
idea fails, while an adept and strong startup team can make even
mediocre ideas a resounding success.

So, how do founders recognise possible team members ahead of time for a
startup team who have that potential? Such potential team members have
some common attributes and approaches that are non-negotiable as far as
building a robust startup team is concerned, and that startup founders
can look for.

Building a phenomenal team can give competitive leverage towards
execution

The startup team should demonstrate complementary and diverse strengths
as well as skillsets. The key is to have a well-balanced team that can
handle a wide range of responsibilities. Team members need to be ready
to wear multiple hats at the same time while being adaptive and
flexible. They must have the ability to read the signs early, and if the
early signs point towards a pivot, they should have the innate strength
to do so quickly.

Personalities and nature of interpersonal relations play a critical role
in the startup journey. Constant conflicts within the startup team can
put the startup's success in serious jeopardy. On the other hand, a
great understanding and camaraderie amongst the founding team members go
a long way in keeping the team together.

Sharing a common vision and maintaining a laser-sharp focus

For a startup to succeed, every team member must share the founder's
vision. It is the founder's responsibility to ensure that the startup
team consists of members that are aligned with the company's vision and
understand why they are doing what they are doing.

More often than not, once the team starts believing in the company's
vision, they exhibit the enviable traits of passion and dedication.
Passion is integral to a startup team as it alone can keep the team
upbeat and motivated at all times.

The founder must maintain a laser focus on narrowing the scope, rather
than expanding it.This means ensuring that side-tracks are eliminated,
cultural alignment is strong, priorities are on common ground, and the
people are mature enough to understand the realities and on-ground
situation.

Prior startup andindustry-specific experience

Investor evaluation of startups follows a mixed pattern. While some
investors rely on their instincts and are positive about the future of
the startups, others look for mitigating the risk factor by giving
weightage to the previous experience of a startup launch. Before
investing in a startup, investors exude confidence on startup teams
which include talent with domain and industry-led expertise, especially
in sectors where specialised knowledge is required, viz., AI, ML,
medicine, etc.

Therefore, founding teams must possessstreet smarts, as well as prior
skills and experience as the startup culture is all about getting hands
dirty, multi-tasking and learning on a day-to-day basis. While the prior
experience will help in bringing domain expertise and product
orientation to the business, a street smart approach will lead to
customer centricity and ensuring relationships with stakeholders.

Willing to learn and ability to see challenges as opportunities

The startup propensity to be flexible in approach, willingness to learn
from past mistakes and openness to feedback is a critical trait that
investors look for. Investors in fact like to see founding teams that
see every problem as an opportunity to innovate, rather than a chance to
fail.

Obstacles should be seen as creative challenges that pave the way for
innovation rather than as impediments. The tasks that seem
insurmountable often have an alternate and perhaps a better solution
that is lurking around the corner. You just need to look hard.

While it is important for startup founders to keep all these factors in
mind while hiring, the mantra is not to build the team keeping the
startup phase alone in mind. It is prudent to plan the hiring
requirements not only around the present stage but also around where the
company is headed in the future. Keeping in mind the long-term vision
for the business is the key to building a team that stays together on
the journey.

To sum up, one of the key focus areas while starting up is to assemble a
passionate team that believes in a collective vision, is adept at
multitasking and revels in getting its hands dirty to make things
happen. In formative years of any startup, talent edge is a key
differentiator where small teams are expected to deliver big results.

May 11 -- In April, we brought you over a dozen breakout sessions on
fundraising and operations at the TC Early Stage event. Calendly's Tope
Awotona explained how to bootstrap effectively, Marlon Nichols shared
how to get an investor's attention, Zoom CRO Ryan Azus talked about how
to build and lead a sales team, and Fuel Capital's Leah Solivan told us
about the worst startup habits and how to kick them.

But that was just the tip of the iceberg.

On July 8 and 9, we're bringing even more of that goodness to the table
with TC Early Stage Marketing & Fundraising. Our speakers will give
brief presentations around a variety of startup core competencies, like
product-market fit, paid marketing strategies, and of course,
fundraising. Each session is specifically designed to allow for loads of
audience Q&A so you can ask your own questions to these experts.

Check out the sessions below:

Product-Market Fit is All About Tempo with Mike Vernal
(Sequoia)Sequoia's Mike Vernal understands that the most successful
companies are not necessarily the ones with a great idea, but the
ability to learn from their customers and adapt quickly. Hear this
seasoned venture partner explain how customer feedback loops, product
iteration tempo and mindset not only affect fundraising, but the overall
trajectory of the company.

How to Line Up Your Growth with Your Goals with Susan Su (Sound
Ventures)Unlike giant brands, startups need to use their marketing spend
wisely and efficiently. Sound Ventures' Susan Su is a growth marketing
expert and will share how to define growth based on your startup's
goals, and how to take a framework-based approach to growth, rather than
relying on old playbooks that aren't relevant.

How to Navigate the Ever-Changing World of Early-Stage VC with Avlok
Kohli (AngelList Venture)With over 25 personal investments, AngelList
Venture CEO Avlok Kohli knows a thing or two about early-stage
fundraising. At Early Stage, Kohli will explain the landscape of the
early-stage fundraising market and how to take advantage of the changes
in the VC world over the past year.

Design Matters with Scott Tong (Designer Fund)Design has never been more
important. Users have been spoiled and startups, along with big brands,
are offering designers many more seats at the table. Hear from Designer
Fund's Scott Tong on how to think about design from the early stage and
how it can impact everything from UX to brand awareness to long-term
vision.

How Founders Can Think Like a VC with Lisa Wu (Norwest Venture
Partners)Though there is more capital flowing through the market than
ever before, the world of fundraising can still feel like a black box to
many founders. Hear Norwest Venture Partners' Lisa Wu explain how
founders can get in the mind of a VC, framing their company's narrative
in terms that VCs love. Be the ball, as they say.

How to Capitalize on Being Coached with Ted Wang (Cowboy Ventures)Ted
Wang, partner at Cowboy Ventures, comes from the legal world where he
was a partner at Fenwick. In short, he's seen his fair share of startup
success and failure. At Early Stage, Wang will explain the value of
coaching for startup founders, including the different types of coaches
one might utilize, how to choose between them, and how to get the most
out of a good coach.

Nail the Narrative with Caryn Marooney (Coatue Ventures)Storytelling is
a critical skill for startups. Coatue Management partner Caryn Marooney,
formerly head of comms for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus,
will share how to frame the narrative for a startup depending on the

Persistence is key: Meet entrepreneurs who survived hardships and losses
to run successful businesses

Challenges and hardships can often cripple us into submission. But these
entrepreneurs survived and persisted, going on to lead successful
businesses.

We often hear stories of entrepreneurs who started small and made a big
business. But today, SMBStory, has brought for you a dose of motivation
from those who faced fears, risked themselves, and fought through them
like a warrior.

These entrepreneurs went through unique challenges and hardships and
built successful businesses.

Bhupat Brothers

Stories about people moving to big cities to chase their dreams are a
plenty but few have the grit to nurture their roots and find success in
their home cities. Founders of Sheetal Cool Products (SCPL) are on a
mission to put their city - Amreli - on the map.

"Iss shehar ne hume bahot diya hai (this city has given us a lot); now
it is time to give it back," says Yash Bhuva, Executive Head of SCPL,
which is based out of Amreli in Gujarat.

Beginning its journey from a paan shop in a street to building a
publicly-listed food manufacturing company that aims to make Rs 300
crore turnover by the next fiscal year, SCPL has come a long way. The
company is now eyeing to capture a pan-India market from Gujarat's
Saurashtra region.

SCPL was born when Jagdish Bhuva took a new step in his life, leaving
the family's agriculture occupation and starting a paan and cold drink
counter shop by the name Sheetal Pan & Cold Drinks in a street in Amreli
in 1987. His younger brothers, Bhupat, Dinesh, and Sanjay soon joined
him.

The family had only just begun the business, and before the venture
could establish itself, the local municipality demolished the shop in
1989.

For the Bhuva brothers, this small shop was their only source of
livelihood. After struggling for two years, they were able to arrange
money and buy another small shop in front of Amreli bus stand in 1991.
Since then there has been no looking back.

Today, SCPL makes ice cream, dairy products, and namkeens apart from
other food items. The state of Gujarat has now given the company a
go-ahead to set up 50 ice cream parlours in the region, the largest so
far after Amul.

Tulja Sukhdayalsing Sharma

While the business community and media were celebrating, and rightly so,
the rise of women entrepreneurship in India on the occasion of Women
Entrepreneurship Day, a 34-year-old frail woman stood resolutely under
her dripping umbrella awaiting a bus.

A business owner herself, she was on her way to meet a potential
customer. Tulja Sukhdayalsing Sharma aka Rani Tulja has a small workshop
in Aurangabad under the name of Tulja Tooling in the machine tools
business. For nearly two years now, she has been out on the road, come
rain or shine, meeting industrialists and manufacturers to sell her
products.

Being one of the few women who chose to set up her own tooling workshop
rather than work in another establishment, soft-spoken Rani Tulja stands
out in this macho landscape of machines and tools.

After completing her diploma in Draftman Mechanical from the town, Rani
not only battled the prejudice that her gender attracts, but had to
undergo severe personal challenges to the point where she even
contemplated ending her life.

Yet, today, she stands tall.

She has not only found a firm footing in her area of expertise but has
expanded the market of her products to neighbouring Kolhapur, Nagpur,
and other states like Gujarat and Punjab. Today, she has five machines,
including a milling machine, lathe machine, and drill machine, and
employs two workers. She does the design, technical work, and marketing
herself, and made a modest sum of Rs 24 lakh last year.

Rahul Goel

Rahul Goel was still studying at Amity University, Noida, when he was
helping his father in his car accessories business located in Karol
Bagh, New Delhi. The company was dealing in the manufacturing of car
mats, speakers, and other accessories. One day, while working at their
office, he found that his father had a registered trademark for a brand
'Woodman', but had never used it.

"Living in times when internet penetration is so deep, I asked my father
if he wanted to make use of the trademark and if we should sell our
products online. My father was very supportive but he guided me towards
starting up my brand, a separate entity rather than scaling up the
existing business," Rahul tells SMBStory.

As Rahul already had a knack for entrepreneurship, initiating a new
business wasn't hard for him. In 2015, he approached ecommerce platforms
like Flipkart and Amazon to list his Android car stereo system on the
marketplace.

"Flipkart had newly launched the car accessory category then in 2015,"
Rahul says, adding that just after he listed his products, demand poured
in. Within seven months, he had done business of around Rs 60 lakh.

However, his venture saw several ups and downs. Rahul bore a huge loss
of Rs 1 crore and was in heavy debt in just two years of starting
Woodman.

So, what helped Rahul recover losses and restart the business that holds
such a good position today that he is aiming for ambitious expansion in
2022? Rahul says, "Focus".

Today, Woodman makes a revenue of Rs 5 crore, and Rahul expects the
company to close FY22 at Rs 7.5 crore.

Keshav Rai

Twenty-seven-year-old Keshav Rai was an average student in school but
his keen interest in repairing things made him pursue engineering.
However, he soon got bored and decided to try his hands at
entrepreneurship.

Keshav was so serious about starting his own company that he requested
his father to fund one of his app-based businesses in 2015. But as they
say, timing is everything. Keshav's first two startups were failures,
but he never gave up on innovating and learning.

Having failed in the first two business attempts, Keshav left home, and
spent tough days before encountering the idea of starting a
semi-automatic bike cover business.

Keshav started Bike Blazer in late 2016. It offers two-wheeler parking
covers that are water-resistant and protects vehicles from dust. The
handy device can be fixed on the vehicle and the overall operational
time of the cover is below 30 seconds, says Keshav.

Today, Bike Blazer is seeing an annual turnover of Rs 1.3 crore.

How Marmeto is changing the ecommerce game with Shopify

When it came to his career choices, it took a couple of wrong moves
before Shashwat Swaroop landed his dream career as an entrepreneur.
Inspired by a family member, he first sought to become a lawyer, until
his career counselor suggested that he try his hand at engineering as it
had better prospects. A year into engineering, Shashwat realised his
heart wasn't in it.

"I realised that I didn't want to become an engineer like many
engineering students in the country. Instead, I wanted to build
something and innovate," says the 25-year-old.

The drive powered his passion as he launched a few ventures before
tasting success with Marmeto in 2017 . The Benagluru-based web
development agency builds technology-driven capabilities and features
for e-commerce stores running on Shopify and helps them drive customer
satisfaction and user retention.

Shashwat and his two co-founders - Saurav K and Prabhat Kumar Prasad -
were a part of the Shopify Partner program that supported the startup in
its growth journey by offering technical expertise, resources,
mentorship and a robust ecosystem to scale.

While entrepreneurship can be a fulfilling journey, it is not a
cakewalk. Before the hard work yielded any results, Shashwat traversed
through a challenging journey with more than a few bumps on the road.

Reaping success with grit and determination

Eager for a fresh start while he was still in college, Shashwat got
together with a group of his batchmates to launch an e-commerce startup
in 2014. "We started scaling it up and soon enough, our efforts were
reaping rich rewards. By 2015, we were finishing over 150 orders a day."
They also managed a good SEO ranking without spending anything on paid
marketing.

"However, the idea ran its course as we were into book writing and
textbooks didn't command a great price in India. Plus, there were
logistical issues leading to a negative margin," says Shashwat.

Out of funds and bandwidth, he was far too involved in the startup
ecosystem to give it up so soon. After briefly consulting e-commerce
brands and consumer technology startups, he went on to join Qtrove, an
e-commerce platform selling natural and sustainable products.

Shashwat saw the stint as an opportunity to prove himself after the
disappointing failure of his first startup. "I helped the platform scale
and build the technology vendor vertical from scratch. The experience
gave me the confidence to take an entrepreneurial plunge again and
that's when Marmeto came into the picture."

Incidentally, Qtrove was operating on Shopify and as the former scaled,
Shashwat realised the need for an enterprise platform like Shopify. "We
came across several platforms, but they weren't catering to individual
needs of brands in India because they had access to international
markets like the US and UK which fetched them easy money for relatively
small jobs," he explains.

The penny dropped when Shashwat realised the growing opportunity to
build localised solutions for the distinct problems faced by Indian
e-commerce brands running on Shopify and help them tap into its
potential.

Vocal for localised solutions

Shashwat says that the easiest part of the task was to get his
co-founders on board. "I didn't even have to convince them. We all had
that drive to innovate," he laughs. The trio started exploring new
avenues in customer satisfaction that Shopify could open up for them and
saw an opportunity between the platform's offerings and what Indian
brands needed.

For instance, India's is a cash-driven market. While the volume of cash
on delivery (COD) orders was high, Shopify didn't have the facility back
then. "Moreover, as not all merchants could deliver at all locations,
the platform needed a capability where a merchant could restrict
services to specific pin codes. Or, could charge an additional fee for a
COD order," he explains.

Another problem area that beckoned attention was returns to origin
(RTO). "In 2017, Indian merchants were looking for a way to validate
mobile numbers; absence of this feature often caused heavy losses to
merchants when an order was returned due to incorrect contact details.
We built solutions that could help a merchant verify a customer's mobile
number with an OTP, before a COD order was processed. With the solution,
merchants could validate the customers' mobile numbers and avoid frauds.
"

Leveraging innovation to drive impact with Shopify

As a budding startup, Marmeto had its work cut out. They were assisted
by the Shopify Partnerships team who were always available and often
brainstormed with the co-founders to find out what kind of solutions
needed to be built. For Shashwat, what stood out about Shopify was that
it treated their partners as team members.

One of the toughest hurdles that the bootstrapped startup faced was to
rope in merchants who didn't know much about Shopify's potential. "Most
merchants saw Shopify as a platform which catered to an exclusive
audience. They needed to see how brands were scaling by using Shopify.
This gave us a purpose and led us to build more scalable and innovative
solutions that could be integrated with Shopify easily," Shashwat adds.

As Shopify expanded its footprint in India, it came across new
challenges specific to high-scale brands that are looking to boost
operations. The problems gave Marmeto a chance to think bigger and
innovate at scale.

Talking about how anyone with web development and design skills can work
remotely and become a Shopify partner to support businesses globally,
Vargab Bakshi, Partnerships Lead at Shopify India believes that the
e-commerce sector represents a massive opportunity if the number of
brands springing up in the country are any indication.

"Marmeto is an inspiring story for all tech entrepreneurs out there.
They are a top agency supporting fast growing brands like Epigamia,
mCaffeine and MTR who use Shopify as their e-commerce platform.
Shopify's Partner program allows agencies and freelancers to work with
1.7 million+ businesses across the world. It is a vibrant ecosystem of
entrepreneurs helping entrepreneurs," he adds.

Anubhav Bassi on working in Ranbir-Sharaddha's Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar:
'Had a lot of fun, Luv Ranjan is quite funny'; Standup comic Anubhav

Video. In the show, the comedian makes fun of his failures in life.

Standup comic Anubhav Bassi recently came up with his show Bas Kar Bassi
on Amazon Prime Video. In the show, the comedian makes fun of his
failures in life.

Stand-up comedian Anubhav Singh Bassi started his career as a lawyer. He
graduated from National Law University, Lucknow. Then he thought he is
not cut for the job of a lawyer, so he started preparing for civil
services. Soon, he realised he would never be able to clear that as well
and he opened a restaurant with his college friends. He failed at being
an entrepreneur too. Eventually, he found his calling in stand-up
comedy. Soon enough he realised he is good at it and even gained
prominence in the field with his hilarious set-pieces. His comic persona
has now landed him a role in Luv Ranjan's upcoming film, Tu Jhoothi Main
Makkaar, and from his debut acting project, Bassi has learnt how acting
is starkly different from performing live on stage.

"These are two totally different art forms. I cannot relate one to the
other. In one, I have to write my lines and perform. In another, I have
to perform the dialogues written by someone else and am responsible for
someone else's hard work. But, I enjoyed it a lot," Bassi said while
speaking about his first acting experience.

The experience turned out to be a joyride for Bassi because of Luv
Ranjan and the film's writer Rahul Mody. The like-mindedness of the trio
made them gel well on the sets of Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar. "I enjoyed
everything that Luv sir made me do in the movie. I loved the entire
process. Luv sir and Rahul sir are quite funny people. We used to talk
about similar things, so our jokes mostly landed and we used to have a
lot of fun," the comedian shared.

Anurag Bassi recently came out with his debut comedy special, Bas Ka
Bassi, on Amazon Prime Video. The show is 90 minutes of pure
entertainment as the comedian makes some relatable jokes about the work
culture at startups and fickle mindedness of youth today about their
career choices. He starts with his experience of working with a lawyer
after completing his graduation and addresses his failed attempt at
entrepreneurship.

During an interaction with indianexpress.com, Bassi shared how he came
up with the name of his debut stand-up special. He narrated, "Ashish
Solanki (comedian) and I were going to some corporate show in Gurgaon in
a cab and I was cracking jokes which were not funny at all. Then Solanki
said, 'Bas kar Bassi.' Two minutes later, we realised it was a good name
for a show. So, when I started my solo show, I named it Bas Kar Bassi."

Bassi mostly creates humour through his lived moments in life. Bas Kar
Bassi has him making fun of himself and his friends for switching many
careers. But, in reality, he has no qualms about trying different things
before finally becoming a comedian. He called himself a "shaukeen" while
sharing how he never sticks to doing something in life just because he
started doing it. He said, "Main shaukeen admi hun, agar main kuch
shaunk se nahi kar raha hun toh main nahi karta hun (If I am not
enjoying something, I will not do it). Anything which makes you happy
and content, you should do that."

In Bas Kar Bassi, the comedian makes fun of his failure and, while
making these jokes, he learned that things that made him sad were
actually not that upsetting.

"The most wonderful part about being a comedian is the things that have
pained you the most are the things with which you are spreading
happiness," he shared, while adding that it's not difficult to crack
jokes on oneself when you realise that "things you were cribbing over
didn't make you as upset or sad." He quoted examples, "When I was
preparing for UPSC, I used to think why am I not able to crack it, but
when I joke about it, I realise that I actually didn't put in as much
effort into it. It's just that main dukhi zyada ho raha tha."

Bassi believes that his on-screen persona is quite similar to his
off-screen persona. So, it doesn't bother him when people expect him to
be funny most of the times because he is a comedia. But he gets
"annoyed" when people expect him to tell jokes at a place like a family
wedding.

He shared, "What sometimes annoys me is when you have gone somewhere
with a different mood and you are expected to be the same there as well.
For example, if I go to some of my relative's wedding and there I am
asked by any distant relative to crack a joke, that irritates me. Tab
lagta hai ye koi jagah nahi hai ye baat karni hai, ab koi bank mein hai
toh vo yahan note toh nahi gin raha na (Then I feel like saying that
this is not the place for that. Now, someone working at a bank is not
counting the notes at a wedding)."

Anubhav Bassi's Bollywood debut Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar will hit the
theaters on March 8.

The Circle.Work-backed Circle of Angels has already onboarded over 50
angel investors, including Tanmoy Chakrabarty, Safir Anand, Ashok
Venkataramani, and more.

Gurugram-based Circle of Angels (CoA) on Tuesday announced its first
round of fundraising of Rs 25 crore, which will be used to fund startups
across sectors. The Circle. Work-backed platform connects startups,
mentors, and investors with each other.

Founded by Karanpal Singh in 2018, CoA aims to drive positive change in
an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, business partners, investors, business
angels, venture capitalists, and crowd-funders. Membership to this
network is by invite or referrals from existing members, and the angels
pledge a minimum annual investment commitment of Rs 5 lakh that can go
up depending on deal size, which varies between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 3
crore.

CoA claims it has already attracted a highly vetted, and curated list of
over 200 senior angels, investors, startup founders, and tech pundits
from around the globe, specialising in fields like fintech, law,
finance, SaaS, digital media, artificial intelligence, and
cybersecurity, among others. The investment thesis of CoA will be to
back startups with disruptive business models, high growth, and scale
potential.

Rajiv Bathla, Chief Operating Officer, The Circle.Work, said,
"Early-stage startups are prone to failure despite sound business ideas
due to lack of access to funds, but more importantly, mentorship and
networks. Through CoA, The Circle.Work intends to invite experienced and
accomplished business angels to provide valuable advice and create
important connections between founders, entrepreneurs, and corporations.
Our role will be that of a catalyst to help startups navigate through
the early days of their journey. Initially, we plan to work with about
10-12 company boards, and actively create a bespoke deal flow for their
funding."

In a statement, CoA said it has already onboarded over 50 angels,
including Tanmoy Chakrabarty (Group Government Affairs Officer, Tata
Sons Private Limited); Raghu C.V. (Group General Counsel at Samvardhana,
Motherson Group); Vijay Yalamanchili (Founder and CEO, Keka); Safir
Anand (renowned IP lawyer and strategist), Ashok Venkataramani (Founder
of Intelligent Insights); and Sandeep Budhiraja (Executive Director at
BYLD Group).

Amit Dutta, the Chief Evangelist of CoA and a serial entrepreneur, said,
"Our country's aspiration of achieving a $5 trillion economy would be
powered by the unleashing of vibrant entrepreneurship culture, and CoA
is in a unique position to support this disruptive growth by enabling
budding entrepreneurs to not be shackled by concerns on access to
early-stage capital and providing them quality mentorship, best
practices and learnings, and the motivation to succeed in a road less
travelled."

On the social and conceptual structure of the 50-year research landscape
in entrepreneurial finance

Introduction

Entrepreneurial firms play a crucial role in economic, social, and
environmental sustainability globally. According to the statistics of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), firm
start-ups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) contribute to 99
percent of all businesses and around 50–60 percent of added value (OECD
, ). Regarding developed countries, for example, in the United States of
America (U.S.) job market, start-ups are among major job creators, even
though their impact on net job creation is not sustainable as more than
half of them fail in the first 5 years (Dilger ; Gompers and Josh ).
Also, small start-ups play a significant role in fostering innovation,
which is one of the crucial factors that lead to economic growth and
structural transformation, by reducing bureaucratic inertia and
resistance to new R&D (Dent et al. ; Megginson ; Scherer ). Most
recently, when the world is suffering from the COVID-19 outbreak,
entrepreneurs are racing to find a vaccine for the virus. One of the
front-runners in the race is Robert Langer, a scientist-entrepreneur
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Dayton ). As for
developing nations, newly established businesses are expected to drive
economic development without compromising the future of social and
environmental aspects in both the short and long term (Dean and McMullen
; Dhahri and Omri ; McMullen ; Vuong et al.

).

Entrepreneurship, being an indispensable part of economies, has also
undergone various phases of development along with the socio-economic
changes all over the world. Since the 1920s, Ludwig von Mises,
an Austrian-school economist, had predicted the collapse of the Soviet
Union due to the problems of central economic planning (Von Mises ). He
claimed that knowledge and information could be utilized fully only in a
decentralized market system with free competition and pricing. When the
Soviet hammer and sickle flag lowered for the last time over the Kremlin
in 1991, the dissolution of the Soviet Union marked a milestone in
the changes of socio-economic structures not only in the post-communist
countries but also in capitalist nations.

The third Industrial Revolution, which is an era of rapid technological
progress associated with the development of information technologies,
has also marked the introduction of computers and the Internet. This
revolution has created enormous opportunities for entrepreneurs and
venture capital firms worldwide. However, it also leads to the so-called
Internet bubble, a.k.a. The “dotcom bubble” in 2001. The combination of
several factors, including speculative or fad-based investing, an
abundance of venture capital funding for start-ups, and the failure of
dotcoms to turn a profit, resulted in a loss of 77% in the NASDAQ index,
as well as the burst of several internet companies. Then, the global
financial crisis of 2007–2008 was caused by excessive risk-taking by
banks and a downturn in the subprime lending market in the U.S. This
crisis was then spread to Europe and the rest of the world. The
International Monetary Fund estimated that large U.S. and European banks
lost more than $1 trillion on bad loans and toxic assets.

Such drastic socio-economic changes in the last several decades have
considerably affected the emergence and growth of entrepreneurship and
entrepreneurial finance research. Therefore, it is imperative for
researchers to conduct a review that can present a general picture of
entrepreneurial finance literature and offer future research directions.

Several scientists have recently examined the state of the art of
entrepreneurial finance; to mention a few, studies of Bellavitis et al.
() and Cumming et al. () are great examples. Bellavitis et al. ()
provide knowledge of current emerging sources of entrepreneurial finance
and generally forgotten sources as well as the insufficiencies of
mainstream theories in the entrepreneurial context. They also suggest
that future attention should be paid to new sources of entrepreneurial
funding (e.g., crowdfunding), usually ignored conventional financing
sources (e.g., bank debt), and the globalization of entrepreneurial
finance markets. Cumming et al. () summarize recent advances in the
literature regarding the financing of entrepreneurial firms during their
lifecycle, the effect of business angels on newly established firms'
economic performance, and how entrepreneurs finance from venture
capital. Based on the summary, the authors recommend future research to
examine the international flows of funding given the development of
Internet-based financing platform (like crowdfunding), the interplay
between different types of investors given that financing sources (e.g.,
crowdfunding, business angel, venture capitalists, etc.) as complements
or substitutes for each other, and the sustainability as well as
social-human capital of board members.

These studies, together with others such as those of Chemmanur and
Fulghieri (), Cumming and Groh (), and Fraser et al. (), provide
relatively comprehensive and detailed research trends. However, all of
them are narrative reviews that are subjective in nature and
significantly influenced by prior knowledge of the researchers (Kraus et
al. ). Moreover, these works merely focus on some facets of
entrepreneurial finance research. The current body of literature in this
discipline, despite its significant growth over the last few decades,
has not provided an overview landscape of this research area. As a
result, this study aims to fill this gap by using bibliometrics, which
has been widely applied to help researchers to assess the discipline's
landscape, and governments/funding organizations to optimize the
efficiency and effectiveness of research and funding allocation (Moed ;
Weingart ). The increasing popularity of this statistical method results
from its advantages, including large-scale applicability, easy
replicability, and perceived objectivity (Haustein and Larivière ). In
particular, compared to traditional methods to conduct literature
reviews, bibliometric analysis can present objective criteria to
evaluate the developments in a research field. They can also serve as a
useful tool to measure scholarship quality and productivity (Aparicio et
al. ; Cobo et al. ). In addition, the systematization and replication
processes offered by this method can enhance understanding of the
knowledge dissemination in a field. They can point out research gaps and
directions to advance the discipline. Zupic and Čater () further claim
that bibliometrics provides “a systematic, transparent and reproducible
review process,” which helps describe, evaluate, and monitor published
research. Therefore, bibliometric analyses can bring new insights into
the entrepreneurial finance field as a complement to previous research.

Therefore, given the complexity and dynamics in the entrepreneurial
finance field, we aim to provide an overall picture of the discipline by
using bibliometrics to answer the following research questions:

What are the volume and the most crucial period within the
50-year-period of development of the entrepreneurial finance discipline?

What is the social structure (or collaboration patterns) across levels
(individual, institution, and country-level) in entrepreneurial finance
literature?

What is the conceptual structure (or main research domains) in
entrepreneurial finance literature?

What are future research directions in entrepreneurial finance
scholarship?

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. “” describes the
Materials and Methods employed in our study. “” presents the main
results.“” provides a discussion of the results and a conclusion.

Materials and methods

Bibliometric analysis

Science mapping is one of the major components of bibliometrics,
together with scientific output and impact evaluation. To study the
collaboration patterns across levels (individual, institution, and
country), we employ the science mapping workflow suggested by Cobo et
al. () and Aria and Cuccurullo (): study design, data retrieval, data
analysis (descriptive analysis, network matrix creation, and
normalization), data visualization (mapping), and interpretation. The
current study aims to explore two out of three structures of knowledge
(K-structures): conceptual structure (by co-word analysis), and social
structure (by co-author analysis).

The co-authorship analysis is performed to study the collaboration
patterns among authors, institutions, and countries in various
scientific disciplines, such as clinical research, business, and
management research, and social research, etc. (Aria et al. ; Fonseca et
al. ; Marzi et al. ). Through co-authorship analysis, the social network
of authors, institutions, and countries within a scientific discipline
can be visualized. A social network consists of two fundamental
components: node and edge. Each node represents an author (institution
or country), while each edge represents a connection between two authors
within a social context. The size of a node is proportionate to the
total number of connections the given node has with other nodes (or the
degree of the given node). The thickness of an edge illustrates the
frequency that two nodes connected by the given edge appear together.

In order to define groups of authors (institutions or countries) that
obtain similar collaboration patterns, a similarity analysis is
performed using the multilevel approach by Blondel et al. (). This
approach, known as a multilevel modularity optimization algorithm (or
Louvain algorithm), is based on the maximization of a modularity score Q
(Newman ). Another algorithm that is used simultaneously with the
Louvain algorithm to plot the social network is Kamada-Kawai layout
algorithm (Kamada and Kawai ).

Thematic mapping, built upon the keyword co-occurrence network and
clusters, is performed to study the conceptual structure of
entrepreneurial finance. Groups of frequently co-occurring keywords are
identified by the simple center algorithm of Coulter et al. (). The
detected research domains (or clusters) are later plotted on a thematic
map. A thematic map is a two-dimensional diagram characterized by two
parameters: “density” (x-axis) and “centrality” (y-axis), which help
categorize themes into four quadrants (Cobo et al. ). The centrality and
density are measured by the Callon et al. ()-proposed formula.

The upper-right quadrant: clusters in this area are called motor themes,
which are both well developed and essential for the structuring of a
research field. They show strong centrality (high degree of external
interaction) and high density (high internal strength of the network).

The upper-left quadrant: clusters in this area are internally
well-developed, but lack external interaction with other themes, so they
are very specialized and peripheral in character.

The lower-right quadrant: clusters in this area are important for a
research field due to their high centrality, but not developed. The
characteristics of these clusters are transversal, general, and
essential.

The lower-left quadrant: clusters in this area are both undeveloped and
marginal because of their low centrality and density. They can be
emerging themes or vanishing themes.

Search strategy

To conduct a bibliometric analysis, selecting a proper database is very
important. The current study examines the landscape of entrepreneurial
finance research with data retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS)
database of Clarivate. WoS is one of the most reputable and
long-standing databases in both Natural Sciences and Engineering and
Social Sciences and Humanities.

Entrepreneurial finance is a field encompassing the intersection of two
major fields, “entrepreneurship” and “finance”. Studies in
entrepreneurial finance do not merely examine how entrepreneurs make a
financial decision or allocate financial resources (Paré et al. ). In
fact, this is a relatively interdisciplinary field, linking various
areas such as public policy, psychology, sociology, and geography
(Cumming and Johan ). Therefore, we define entrepreneurial finance
research as any studies that are related to financial issues among
entrepreneurs and organizations with entrepreneurial orientation.

Based on prior bibliometric studies about entrepreneurship (Aparicio et
al. ; Vallaster et al. ), we utilize the keyword search with the
following words: “entrepreneur*” (entrepreneur, entrepreneurs,
entrepreneurial, and entrepreneurship), “start-up*”, “new enterprise*”,
and “new firm*”. For finance, we review studies of Padilla-Ospina et al.
(), Xu et al. (), Zhang et al. (), and Cumming and Groh (), and
determine to use the following search keywords: “financ*” (finance,
financing, financial, financer, and financier), “debt*”, “venture
capital*” (venture capitalist and venture capitalists), “trade credit*”,
“crowdfund*” (crowdfunding, crowdfunded, crowdfunding, and Crowdfunder),
“angel invest*”, “private equit*” (private equity and private equities),
and “IPO*”.

The search was conducted on the 2nd March 2020 through the field tag
“Topic”. The search can be replicated using the following search query:

When searching the WoS database, we followed prior pieces of literature
in the same vein (Ferreira et al. ; Marzi et al. ; Xu et al. ) and
extracted documents in the “article” category because papers listed in
this category had been through the rigorous peer-review process. Because
we perceive entrepreneurial finance as an interdisciplinary field, we
did not limit the search query to any research areas. Also, the
documents have to be written in English from 1990–2020. Eventually,
7,873 documents are extracted.

After retrieving documents from the online database, we curated and
removed unqualified data. In total, 971 documents were excluded from the
analysis because (1) they are published in 2020, (2) they obtain no
publication year, or (3) they are retracted articles, books, book
sections, proceeding papers, or data papers. We did not include any
book, proceeding paper, and other types of publications except for
research articles because either WoS or Scopus concentrate more on
journals and less on other means of scientific knowledge dissemination
(Mongeon and Paul-Hus ).

Procedure

The data were initially downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS)
database based on the keywords mentioned above and inclusion criteria
under the.txt format. The data consisted of authors' names, authors'
affiliations, titles, publication sources, abstracts, keywords, and
cited references. The downloaded data were later curated and excluded
unqualified publications in Excel after converting from.txt files. The
bibliometrix R package (Aria and Cuccurullo ) was employed to analyze
and extract specific data from the.txt format. The package provides two
alternatives to perform the bibliometric analysis; one is for coders,
and another one is for ordinary users employing the biblioshiny
function, which is a web-based application developed on Shiny
environment. In this study, co-authorship analysis is conducted through
coding, and thematic mapping is conducted using the biblioshiny function
for the sake of flexibility and aesthetics. For transparency, the
study's anticipated limitations are described in the Discussion
following (Vuong ).

Results

Scientific output

This section provides an overview of the research landscape of
entrepreneurial finance from 1970 to 2019. We record a total of 6,902
research articles by 12,855 different authors in 1,891 journals that
meet our criteria.

Publication output

Entrepreneurial finance is a relatively young field of science with the
first paper published in 1970 (Jordan ) and has been growing
dramatically in the last 30 years. Figure  shows the annual number of
publications related to the financing issues of entrepreneurs from 1970
to 2019 with exponential and linear estimations. It can be seen that the
exponential estimate (R2 = 0.93) can explain the research output growth
in this field better than the linear one (R2 = 0.61). Overall, the
annual growth rate of research articles is 19.75 percent (the
calculation does not include the period 1970–1990 due to sensitivity).

The annual number of publications in entrepreneurial finance from
1970–2019

The most important period

We split the annual research articles into four periods: 1970–1990,
1991–2000, 2001–2010, and 2011–2019 (see Table ). The period 1970–1990
can be considered the “takeoff roll” period for the field, with both the
numbers of publications and authors being modest. Meanwhile, the
increase in the number of documents, sources, and authors during the
period 2011–2019 is impressive; solely the proportion of materials,
sources, and authors during this period account for 75.22, 86.15, and
81.86 percent of the field, respectively. Notably, the number of
publications in 2015 almost doubled the number of publications in the
previous year. This unexpected surge might be the consequence of the
emergence of 'crowdfunding' as a new method of financing among
entrepreneurs. The term 'crowdfunding' barely appears before 2010
(Cumming and Groh ). However, it has now become one of the most
attractive research topics within the discipline (Belleflamme et al. ;
Mollick ).

Among the four periods, the 1991–2000 one marked the most crucial
milestone in the history of entrepreneurial finance in terms of
productivity and impactfulness. For productivity, this period obtained
the highest average annual growth rate in the number of studies at
24.46%, and the impact of publications during this period was also the
highest at 77.46 citations per document. The prominence of this period
might result from the dissolution of the Soviet Union (USSR) and the
Internet revolution, as well as other historical events prior to it.

In addition, the increasing number of authors per document over time and
the decreasing share of single-authored papers hint at the rising
collaboration trend among researchers in the discipline of
entrepreneurial finance. The group size measured by the collaboration
index also slightly decreased from 2.5 during 1970–1990 to 2.34 during
2011–2019, which hints at the fact that researchers in this field tend
to collaborate in a smaller group.

Social structure

In this section, we examine the scientific performance and collaboration
patterns across three levels: author, institution, and country. The
results from the national, institutional, and individual levels suggest
the dominance of Western ideologies in the discipline, demonstrated by
the strong presence of influential authors and institutions from the
U.S. In contrast, the lack of authors, institutions, and countries in
continents other than Europe and North America is noticeable (Crew ).
Unfortunately, those left-out countries include the Asia–Pacific area,
which is currently the home of four out of the ten most productive
countries in terms of research productivity, namely China, Japan, Korea,
and Australia. Even though China exposes a sharp rise in scientific
production that ranks 4th among the ten most productive countries,
China's scientific impact is the lowest in terms of both citation per
paper and average JIF.

Most productive authors and their social structure

Among the top ten authors in entrepreneurial finance research based on
full counting and fractional counting methods, the number of authors
affiliated with institutes in Europe and North America is overwhelming
(see Table ). Wonglimpiyarat J is the only author whose affiliation was
outside Europe and North America. Still, the total number of citations
received by the researcher from Thailand is not in line with his/her
production. It is also notable that European authors tend to collaborate
to achieve higher scientific output than authors from other territories.
In detail, 9 out of 11 most prolific authors (including Cumming D) based
on full counting are affiliated with institutions in Europe, whereas
with fractional counting, 5 out of 10 most prolific authors (including
Cumming D) are from North America and Thailand.

Another observation is that Vismara S from the University of Bergamo,
Italy, started his career in the topic of entrepreneurial finance in
2010, which is comparatively later than other researchers on the list.
His success might be in touch with the recently rising topic of
'crowdfunding' (Rossi and Vismara ; Signori and Vismara ; Vismara , ).

Wright M is the most productive author as well as the second most
influential author. His works are cited 3,151 times, with the
corresponding h-index being 27. In terms of scientific impact, Zahra SA
is the most influential researcher in the entrepreneurial finance
discipline even though he only published 21 papers. His classic works
extend our understanding of corporate entrepreneurship and firm
performance (Zahra , ; Zahra and Covin ). Notably, most of the authors
(9/10) start in the 1990s and early 2000s, whereas Cumming D is the only
author publishing most recently but ranked 5th among the top ten most
influential authors with 2,290 citations.

All authors presented in Table are from Western countries. Also, the
impact of the U.S. in entrepreneurial finance is again reaffirmed, with
eight of the most influential authors being affiliated with institutions
in the U.S. The only European representatives in the table are Cumming D
and Hellmann T from the U.K., and Wright M from Belgium.

The first publication year shows the first year the author started to

The author's collaboration network is also visualized. Each node (or
vertex) on the undirected graph indicates a specific author with his/her
name displayed in a label; the size of the node is proportional to the
total node degree measuring how many links start from or arrive in the
given node. If there exists a co-authoring article between two or more
authors, the nodes will be connected by links (or edges); otherwise, the
node will obtain no connection link with other authors on the graph. A
group of frequently collaborated authors will be clustered in the same
color using the Louvain clustering algorithm, and the dotted line shows
a cross-group collaboration between two authors in two different
clusters.

Initially, we visualized the network with 30 most representative
authors, but the result has no clear tendency. Thus, we increased the
number to 60 most representative authors (see Fig. ). Astonishingly,
most of the top ten authors in terms of scientific impact and output
collaborate heavily with each other and form three main groups, which we
may call “supreme groups” in the discipline. Meanwhile, other
researchers tend to work alone or in a small group with two to four
people. When plotting with a higher number of authors (100 and 200 most
representative authors), larger groups of researchers start to emerge,
but those groups are relatively peripheral compared to the “supreme
groups.” The result, therefore, can be considered unchanged.

Most productive institutions and their social structure

Table shows the top ten institutions for scientific production in the
topic of entrepreneurial finance; or, we may say 11 powerhouses. The
three most productive institutions are Harvard University and Indiana
University in the U.S., and Ghent University in Belgium. Interestingly,
all the 11 institutions are in Western countries, eight of which are in
North America (the U.S. and Canada), and others are in Europe (United
Kingdom, Belgium, and Italy). Contributing more than half of the list,
the U.S. is home to most of the powerhouses of entrepreneurial finance
research, including Harvard University, Indiana University, University
of North Carolina, Stanford University, the University of Minnesota,
Babson College, and the University of Pennsylvania. Ghent University in
Belgium is the only institution with three researchers in the list of
top ten authors for scientific production, who are Wright M, Vanacker T,
and Manigart S.

We then visualized the collaboration network of 50 most representative
institutions employing the Kamada-Kawai network layout and Louvain
clustering logarithm (Fig. ). The network points out four main clusters:
(1) Blue cluster–collaboration dominated by private institutions within
the U.S., led by three powerhouses (Harvard University, Stanford
University, University of Pennsylvania, and the University of North
Carolina); (2) Orange cluster–collaboration group dominated by public
institutions within the U.S., led by two powerhouses (Indiana University
and the University of Minnesota); (3) Red cluster–collaboration group
dominated by institutions in the Europe and Canada, led by powerhouses
outside of the U.S. (Ghent University, University of Nottingham, York
University, and the Polytechnic University of Milan); (4) Purple
cluster–collaboration group that has a connection with all clusters, led
by one powerhouse (Babson College); (5) Green cluster–collaboration
group that has a close connection with European institutions.
Nevertheless, only three institutions from other regions outside Western
countries appear in the network (Tsinghua University, Southwestern
University of Finance and Economics, and the National University of
Singapore). This indicates the weak knowledge exchange of institutions
around the world apart from Western countries in the discourse of
entrepreneurial finance. The visualization result from 80 and 100 most
representative institutions reveals the rising distance between clusters
1 and 3, the higher interconnection of clusters 2, 4, 5, and the
marginal appearance of several institutions from China and Hong Kong.
Generally looking, there is not much difference in the bigger picture,
which suggests the Western monocentric in the collaboration network.

Most productive countries and their social structure

With 2,193 articles contributing 31.77 percent of the total publication,
the U.S. is the most productive country. The scientific impact of the
U.S. (76,894 citations and 35.06 citations per article) is also far
ahead of other nations. For some countries, the number of articles does
not reflect much of their impact (see Table ). Netherlands authors have
only 243 articles, but each of them is cited 21.17 times. In a list
dominated by developed Western countries, China is on the rise with 424
publications, but their impacts are relatively low. The average citation
of an article by China is 13.31, making them the least influential
country in the top 10.

The collaboration network of 30 most representative countries presents
three clusters of international collaboration among countries: (1) North
America and Asia, (2) Western Europe, including Italy, (3) South Africa,
North Europe, and Central Europe (see Fig. ). The dominance sign of
Western countries in the research topic of financial issues among
entrepreneurs is relatively transparent that North American and European
countries create three main collaboration networks and significantly
contribute to them. The finding provides an additional piece of evidence
on the influence of Western countries in the field of entrepreneurial
finance.

Conceptual structure

To implement keyword co-occurrence analysis, we use thematic mapping
instead of network visualization to examine the current development
situation of each area as this method is better in evaluating the
current development stage of the research domains than network mapping.
We employ 500 most representative words in the Author Keyword field
rather than the Keyword Plus field because Author Keyword terms are as
useful as Keyword Plus in exploring the knowledge structure of
scientific fields and also provide a more comprehensive representation
of the article's content (Zhang et al. ). A bubble on a bi-dimensional
map presents each detected domain. The terms/words in the bubble are
terms/words with the highest number of occurrences within a domain. The
bubble size is proportional to the word occurrences of the domain, and
the bubble position on the map is given based on Callon's centrality and
density scores.

Here, we present five primary research domains with their current
development stage (see Fig. ). The most extensive research domain (blue)
is associated with the venture capital financing of entrepreneurs, so
the domain is called “venture capital.” This research domain has an
extensive connection with other research domains, but a relatively weak
connection within the domain, which makes it relatively transversal.
Researches in this domain usually concern the relationship between
venture capital and the innovation ability of new firms (Gu and Qian ;
Santos and Qin ), the role of venture capital financing in China (Cheng
et al. ), and gender issues in obtaining venture capital (Guzman and
Kacperczyk ).

Thematic mapping of 500 most representative authors' keywords in
entrepreneurial finance discipline

The second most substantial research domain is “crowdfunding” (purple).
This domain is located on the y-axis, which indicates the growing
external links representing connections with other research domains.
This domain focuses mainly on the crowdfunding topic; some exemplary
studies are Cumming et al. (), Foster (), Hervé et al. (), Vismara (),
and Miller et al. (). As crowdfunding is a recently developed topic and
relatively transversal, the domain's internal links are weak.

The third domain is related to the activities and financial performance
of small-medium enterprises, so we call it “SMEs finance” (green) – the
motor theme of the entrepreneurial finance field. The domain is not only
well developed but also substantially interacted with other domains.
Gomezel and Rangus (), Adomako (), Donkor et al. (), and Farrington et
al. () are some of the exemplary researches. Also, the SMEs' financial
performance and internationalization are often concurrently examined
(Gonzalez-Perez et al. ; Jin et al. ).

The fourth domain (red), titled “social entrepreneurship finance,”
apparently examines how social entrepreneurs finance their businesses.
Social entrepreneurship refers to businesses aiming to create social
value through recognizing opportunities, employing innovation,
tolerating risk, and declining to accept insufficient resources (Peredo
and McLean ). The financing issues of social entrepreneurs in India
attract substantial interest from researchers (Satar and John ; Tasavori
et al. ; Verma ). The topic of microfinancing for poverty alleviation is
also included in this domain (Alawattage et al. ; Hussain et al. ; Price
). Moreover, the financing issues of social entrepreneurship are
frequently studied with sustainability issues (Gray et al. ; Laurell et
al. ), which might require the expansion of external links (or
centrality) due to the interdisciplinary nature of sustainability.

The fifth domain–“IPO and corporate governance” (orange), is relatively
specific to the connection between Initial Public Offering (IPO) and
corporate governance. The knowledge within the domain is developing, but
its interaction with other domains is limited, making the domain
knowledge narrow. Studies in this domain usually pay attention to IPO
underpricing and information asymmetry (Fitza and Dean ; Pollock et al.
; Wang et al. ).

Discussion and conclusion

The historical 1991–2000 period of entrepreneurial finance

From the data of 6,902 research articles between 1970 and 2019, we
consider the 1991–2000 as the most important historical period of
entrepreneurial finance due to the significant growth rate in the number
of articles as well as average citations per document. These may result
from the worldwide historical events occurring in the same period. On
the 26th December 1991, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union voted
itself out of existence, which led to mass migration from USSR countries
to others. Notably, around 800,000 immigrants settled down in Israel
during 1990–2000, whereas the U.S. welcomed approximately 280,000
immigrants from ex-USSR countries during the first half of the 1990s.
The emigration wave to Israel and the U.S. brought with them a large
number of scientists and engineers. These scientists and engineers are
among the people that contributed and facilitated the Internet
Revolution and the surge in hi-tech during the 1990s (Senor and Singer
).

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (), the number of new
business establishments less than 1-year-old increased rapidly from
around 569,000 in 1994 to around 674,000 establishments in 2000. Given
the tremendous number of new business “born” annually, finance becomes a
fundamental need for the survival and performance of start-ups. As a
consequence, the amount of venture capital disbursement during 1991–2000
rocketed by approximately 3,000 percent from nearly $3 to $90 billion
(National Science Board ). Despite a much lower amount of investment,
the European venture capital industry also invested $12 billion in 1999
(Hege et al. ). With such a massive amount of investment,
entrepreneurial finance was a fertile research field for cultivation.

The 1991–2000 period would not have been the most historically important
milestone without the contribution of prior scientific and political
events that helped entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial finance
disciplines take off. The first event that needs to be mentioned is the
Nobel prize of Friedrich von Hayek in the 1970s for the business cycle
mechanism and the effectiveness of a decentralized market system. After
the publication of Schumpeter (Schumpeter ), the prize might bring more
attention to entrepreneurship, which has long been perceived as the
“heart” of the economy by the Austrian School. The idea of a
decentralized market system also affected the world's leaders during the
late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. This idea promoted the liberalizing
of the economy by reducing state intervention and increase
entrepreneurialism. Two exemplary cases are Margaret Thatcher and Ronald
Reagan, with their famous “Thatcherism” and “Reaganomics” being
associated with supply-side economics. The worldwide economic
liberalization, in our opinion, paved the road for not only the rapid
growth in entrepreneurship research (Landström and Lohrke ) but also the
boom in entrepreneurial finance research during 1991–2000.

Then, the dotcom bubble in 2000 affected both the economy and science.
In economic terms, while the number of establishments less than
1-year-old slightly declined by around 3 percent (U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics ), the venture capital investment in the U.S. dropped by
around 79 percent after 2 years (National Science Board ). In science,
the average annual growth rate slowed down to 11.33 percent during
2001–2010. After the Great Recession in 2008, another boom is coming due
to technological advancement and new players in entrepreneurial finance.
In economic terms, the emergence of Industry 4.0 and cryptocurrency
marked a coming of a new technology revolution in the 2010s decade. In
contrast, the publication growth rate increased to 19.81%, partly thanks
to the emergence of crowdfunding – a new web-based financing method.

Western ideological homogeneity and a decade of heterogeneity

There exist some signs of Western ideological homogeneity in
entrepreneurial finance research. Ideological homogeneity has been
researched extensively, especially in political science. The term often
refers to the lack of opinion diversity, as a majority hold a similar
opinion. Regarding the disadvantage of this phenomenon, under the
influence of ideological homogeneity, the minority might be influenced
to adjust their opinions to be in line with the majority, thus narrowing
the realm of intellectual inquiry and debate (Atkeson and Taylor ;
Wojcieszak ). The dominance of ideology may also result in the rejection
of papers on unpopular subjects or with a different point of view. As a
result, scientists with less dominant views may find homogenous
environments hostile; thus, they are less willing to share their
opinions (Campbell ).

The research output and social structure across three levels (authors,
institutions, and countries) in our study reveal some characteristics of
Western ideological homogeneity as suggested by Nescolarde-Selva et al.
() and Atkeson and Taylor (), namely: ideological hegemony and
homogenous social circle of top researchers. First, our findings
indicate that the ten most productive authors, institutions, and
countries are all Western. Only by fractionalizing the count, an author
from Thailand is detected. However, his impact within the field is very
modest, with only 107 citations compared to thousands of citations of
his peers.

Second, the Western monocentric within the discipline seemingly derives
from the close collaboration networks among European and North American
top authors and institutions. Our social structure analysis reveals a
close-knit scientific community formed by institutions within Europe and
North America. Meanwhile, the collaboration network among 60 most
representative authors illustrates “alliances” of top Western authors,
or we may call “supreme groups.” The close connection of Western authors
and institutions might amplify their impact on entrepreneurial finance
and simultaneously reinforce the influential power of the Western
ideology. In contrast, less relevant authors tend to work alone or in a
small group; hence their impact is much smaller than the large research
groups. In such a Western-centric discipline, China has an impressive
performance in terms of publications, but its impact is low compared to
Western countries. Given that entrepreneurial finance is becoming a
global issue (Boyde ; Hruby ; Sindakis ), we would like to raise the
concern of ideological homogeneity in the field of entrepreneurial
finance.

We believe that there are no “one size fits all” theories, concepts, and
frameworks that can explain the dynamics of entrepreneurial finance.
There are always risks in using a “seemingly universal” concept or
framework in analyzing the economic realities occurring in another place
with different sociocultural, institutional, and financial contexts,
which can be reliable predictors of entrepreneurship dynamism (Vuong et
al. ; Vuong , ). Another possible risk is that the dominance of Western
ideology in entrepreneurial finance may constrain researchers from
non-Western countries to share different opinions and direct
international research toward Western research orthodox. We believe that
the economies around the world will take great benefits from a more
ideologically diverse environment. In an ideological heterogeneity
environment, a country might find the most appropriate ideology that is
not only effective in promoting economic development but also receive
less resistance from the institutional and sociocultural filter process
of that country. However, ideological diversity is very costly,
especially for emerging countries, because it requires a strong
scientific foundation and proactive attitudes from researchers,
institutions, and governments (Vuong , ). Thus, besides the effort to
accept heterogenous values from the side of Western communities, we
encourage scientists from non-Western countries to propose new ideas
that reflect from local sociocultural perspectives bravely, and perhaps
established empirical evidence.

Entrepreneurial finance research themes and future research agenda

Based on the co-occurrence analysis of the most 500 authors' keywords,
we identify five main research domains, including “venture capital,”
“crowdfunding,” “SMEs finance,” “social entrepreneurship finance,” and
“IPO and corporate governance.” Among the five domains, there are still
many rooms for further research in “venture capital” and “crowdfunding”
domains. As these two domains are currently the two most popular
financing methods of entrepreneurs, they have a substantive connection
with other themes within the field. Still, the internal links have not
been fully built up. While “venture capital” has played a significant
role in the development of entrepreneurial finance since the 1970s
(Fells ), “crowdfunding” has only started to emerge since 2010 (Cumming
and Groh ), so there are still plenty of rooms for research on the
relationship between crowdfunding and entrepreneurship.

The finding from the conceptual structure asserts that “social
entrepreneurship finance” is an internally well-developed research
domain with the highest density score. We learn that the financing
sources for social entrepreneurs and enterprises mostly come from
familiar sources such as (a) government funds, (b) charitable
organizations, (c) personal networks and business angels, and (d)
microfinance initiatives. Thus, research on “social entrepreneurship
finance” also mainly focuses on these financing sources (Cheah and Ho ;
Cheung et al. ; El Kallab and Salloum ). On the other hand, conventional
financing channels, such as venture capital and IPO, seems not to have
been paid adequate attention. The low centrality score of the research
domain, and a limited number of studies found, confirms this issue
(Achleitner et al. ; Mayer and Scheck ). Given the increase in the
number and size of social venture capital firms, such as Triodos
Investment Management, Vital Capital, Grassroot Business Fund, and
Unitus Seed Fund, etc., more researches on how social entrepreneurs and
enterprises finance from social venture capitals need to be conducted.
Moreover, in regions that lack access to the conventional banking system
or obtain a high inequality level, microfinance might be an excellent
approach to start with.

The vital contribution of venture capital to the development of
start-ups in Western countries from the 1970s has led to intensive
research endeavors exploring the relationship between venture capital
and entrepreneurial firms’ performance. Crowdfunding has recently
emerged as a prominent contributor to the field thanks to the diffusion
of the Internet around the globe. However, as the dotcom bubble was
influenced mainly by the homogeneity of venture capital as the
dominating financing source during the 1990s, overemphasis on one or two
financial sources might not help diminish the adverse consequences of
the next economic crisis. Therefore, we argue that diversifying
viewpoints and financial sources to be studied is an important future
research agenda in entrepreneurial finance.

Prior reviews have directed future research to new sources of financing
as well as conventional sources that remain underexplored, such as
accelerator and incubator, crowdfunding, family offices, university
fund, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), bank, governmental venture capital,
and peer-to-peer lending, etc. (Bellavitis et al. ; Fraser et al. ;
Klein et al. ). In supplement to these suggestions, our findings
highlight the demand for studying financial sources that are crucial in
non-Western contexts. For example, governmental venture capital,
peer-to-peer lending, and family/friend loans are common forms of
financing in countries with high central government control and
collectivism characteristics. Also, a majority of findings in
entrepreneurial finance are based on Western data (Cumming and Johan ;
Mitter and Kraus ), so studies employing cross-sectional and non-Western
data might provide valuable discoveries that contribute to theoretical
and empirical advancements in the entrepreneurial finance discipline.

Strategies for diversification in entrepreneurial finance

The world economy is currently paralyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, with
already more than 11 million confirmed cases and 500,000 deaths by
now (WHO ). The need for diversification is more substantial than ever
as the likelihood of a post-COVID-19 financial crisis is nigh. We,
therefore, would like to propose strategies for policymakers, editors,
reviewers, and authors to diversify the literature of entrepreneurial
finance:

Authors: Non-Western authors need to be more proactive in sharing their
perspectives and knowledge of local financing methods as well as bravely
protect them despite possible criticisms from Western peers due to
different core values (Vuong ). Besides, not only non-Western authors
but also Western peers should have entrepreneurial attitudes to take
risks, explore, and challenge counter-intuitive ideas. These actions
will eventually result in problem-solving ideas through the mechanism of
imaginativeness (Kier and McMullen ). For example, “How can social
enterprise obtain IPO?” and “How can social enterprise balance between
showing investors profit and solving the social-environmental problems?”
can be the two questions to start with.

Journals: Editors and reviewers should be more open-minded with new core
values or perspectives proposed by non-Western scholars. Given that the
majority of members in the editorial boards of entrepreneurial
finance journals are Western scholars, the participation of editors and
reviewers from non-Western national and cultural backgrounds is
necessary. Participation can be promoted through inviting highly
influential non-Western scholars to join the editorial board or initiate
Special Issues on local and regional knowledge of entrepreneurial
finance. The initiative using Special Issues can also be applied to
increase scientific output regarding new players in entrepreneurial
finance (Block et al. ).

Policymakers: Policymakers should implement policies that could promote
cross-national knowledge exchange among authors and institutions through
research collaboration or conference organizations. Moreover, enhancing
the availability and quality of data regarding start-ups’ financial
activities also help foster scientific activities in non-Western
countries (Cumming and Johan ).

Limitations

There are several limitations to acknowledge in our study. Firstly, the
WoS search algorithm provides only results searched in most prominent
sections of the article, but not the whole article (e.g., title,
abstract, keyword, etc.), so it fails to detect articles with deeper
layers of meaning. The bibliometrics method helps develop a holistic and
objective viewpoint on the studied field; nevertheless, key findings
cannot be explained in detail. This requires the implementation of a
qualitative review. Also, in this study, we only use data from the WoS
database and do not consider articles not written in English as well as
other various forms of publication (e.g., books, book sections, and
proceeding papers), so there is a possibility of production bias. The
reason is that some countries usually publish social science studies in
the form of books, use their language to write research papers, and
publish in a local database, such as Japan (Nguyen et al. ).

Furthermore, the findings in this study can only show the dominance of
Western countries in terms of scientific production and international
collaboration within the discipline, but not really an ideological
homogeneity. Therefore, studies employing Y-index, historiography,
co-citation, and qualitative analyses are recommended to examine the
Western ideological homogeneity further.

Online & Offline. Small, Medium and Big Budgets.

Recently I wrote a long list of ideas on startups and new businesses to
start in 2018. Thought of sharing it on YourStory, India's best startup
community.

For starting up, the starting point is not necessarily an idea, it could
be a problem. It could be applying a solution or a different approach to
the existing solutions. You don't even have to think something out of
the box, it could be improvising on other existing solutions.

Remember Facebook is not the world's first social network. WhatsApp now
under Facebook is still dreaming to add features and gain benefits, like
what QQ, WeChat has done in Asian countries. And I am not even including
India under it, India is unique in that regards.

I was in Reliance Infocomm just before everyone in India started having
mobile phones. Now JIO including other Telecom players have bought a
surge of Data Plans, the handset companies are enjoying the wave and
they will for long. I just bought two phones for my family, one brand
didn't even exist few months ago.

Any business that can scale by identifying the need and finding paying
customers will make money. - V Ganapathy, Axilor Ventures

Can there be a rush of opportunities, are you prepared?

Workshop Travel - Travel portal to learn new skills.

Indian travel industry has big opportunities both in India and Abroad.
And Indians going out of India. It needs a healthy atmosphere and
thinking out of the box. With so many arts and cultural activities,
there exists a good opportunity to make it participatory. Learn Manipuri
dance for a week in Manipur. Learn Rajasthani cooking for a week in
Rajasthan. Inclusive and immersive experience for a short period.

Teacher Tutor - Find a teacher near you, to fund her educational
advancement

Every problem needs a solution and there will be so many problems with
you anytime. Teacher are celebrated everywhere but rarely looked at they
might be having their own educational needs. If they love teaching,
logically speaking they would love to learn new things and advance. Can
you create a funding solution like GoFundMe?

Help on Wheels - Networked clinics & ambulances on wheels

Which can scale like Uber or Lyft, possible? Space is a big problem in
cities and even in other Towns. Not everyone can hold Ambulances &
mobile clinics. There might be an opportunity to manage this separately
and assist current medical services.

Homemakers? - What is there?

There are many educated, mobile powered, app using, middle-class Indian
homemakers at home. What do we have to serve their intellectual needs?
Or in terms of physical activities. What can they do in terms of online
business, WFH opportunities, social engagements, hobbies, games and
more?

Daily Global Tiffin - World food in a box.

After food startups successes and failures, the next question is what
they will eat from the same menus and where they will graduate to. From
current convenience, will they see it as a regular daily option. Are
there any possibilities they are already getting bored. India itself has
many things to add to the menu It is much feasible for startups if they
have a mass effect on the menu as well. Think!

Indian SMEs are critical to making India a manufacturing hub and we must
foster the sector if we are to meet the national imperative of inclusive
growth. - R Narayan, Power2SME

Singapore has a thriving startup ecosystem[1]. It stands 18th on the
Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking created by the world-leading innovation
policy advisory and research firm Startup Genome.

The Singapore startup scene has a valuation of USD 22.5 billion, whereas
emerging businesses worldwide are worth USD 3.8 trillion.

However, there are still gaps and challenges businesses face in the
city-state and one of the most common challenges is the woes of
corporate financing.

Challenges for incorporating a business in Singapore

The team behind Cialfo

Singapore-based college application platform Cialfo[2] is among
promising edtech players in the region. Cialfo is not only an
award-winning, fast-growing edtech company but also a digital
transformation leader that is making higher education accessible by
delivering 360 support to students worldwide.

On the other hand, Endowus[3] is Singapore's leading digital wealth
advisor, and the first that allows people to invest across all sources
of wealth including CPF in a single platform. To date, they have
returned more than S$2 million in trailer fees back to their clients.

Yet another startup, Singapore-based Konsyg[4], is a global provider of
end-to-end sales services. With a rich client portfolio in Singapore and
beyond, they claim to provide 70% more effective revenue and lead
generation than internal sales functions and are among the emerging
companies in this sector.

These emerging leaders in respective sectors have had one thing in
common in their journey- the challenges and costs that they have faced
when it came to corporate financing.

'As a rapidly growing startup expanding its operations across 4
countries, regulatory, tax and legal compliance became a significant
challenge as we venture into uncharted territories. Scaling quickly also
means that we often do not have a reserve of internal capabilities and
resources to manage a recurrent surge in business activities,' shares
Evalyn Tan, Finance Director at Cialfo.[6]

The team behind Endowus

We've faced our share of startup related challenges! So, we started from
scratch in 2017 in one of our cofounder's basements with the idea of
solving retirement, and we were bootstrapped all the way through till
2021 when we first raised external money. Accounting, corporate
secretarial, tax and payroll needs were the main area where we needed
help,' says Dominic Ong, the Chief Financial Officer at Endowus.[7]

'From the very beginning, we were well aware that we don't have an
understanding of back-office-related matters, including process,
taxation, and overseas operational setups. Plus, in the sales world,
mitigating expectations is the biggest 'woe'. Companies tend to want
overnight revenue, which makes setting expectations always a challenge.
The misconception is that a lack of overnight results is a flaw in the
sales process when in reality companies should be looking more into
pipeline development in order to judge the quality of the sales
function. So, we needed the team to focus solely on managing client
expectations and helping them achieve their goals through our services.
So, we badly needed a reliable partner for matters like bookkeeping,
taxation and financial management,' shares William Gilchrist, Founder
and CEO of Konsyg[8]

William Gilchrist, CEO and Founder of Konsyg

These challenges are faced by many young and small businesses in the
city-state. In fact, many businesses in Singapore fail[9] due to poor
bookkeeping and inefficient finance management. One of the biggest
challenges is the lack of options out there- large corporate servicing
firms focus on volume while small-scale firms have limited resources and
generally do not have automated processes, which slows down things
considerably.

In fact, Singapore has a relatively easier and quicker process of
business registration, which attracts investors from worldwide. However,
Singaporean businesses are registered only if they meet strict
eligibility criteria, follow the established registration procedure, and
are issued with a certificate of incorporation by the registrar of
business. Deviating from these rules is not acceptable and authorities
follow them strictly.

Plus, Singapore authorities strictly follow businesses' tax compliance
and apply harsh sanctions to non-compliant businesses without
exceptions. While the perk is that corporate income tax is only at 17
per cent but for small and young businesses, with little to no knowledge
of the compliance guidelines, it can be tricky to focus on these things.

PikoHANA: Empowering small and young businesses in Singapore and beyond

This is where PikoHANA, a mid-level corporate servicing team that
focuses on accuracy, automation, and systems, is stepping up and helping
fill in the gaps. PikoHANA helps SMEs scale by digitising their
back-office and operational reporting, giving them access to information
and data that allows them to make key operational and strategic
decisions on a more informed basis.

Dominic from Endowus shares, 'They (PikoHANA) were the ones that helped
us to incorporate in 2017! PikoHANA took care of our accounting,
corporate secretarial, tax and payroll needs, enabling us to focus our
attention on achieving product/market fit - and we are now the leading
digital wealth platform in Singapore!'

'In Q1 2022, we received our license in Hong Kong, our first overseas
market, and we asked PikoHANA to manage our accounting and payroll needs
for that as well. It simplifies our life to have one partner supporting
us for both markets,' he adds.

Evalyn from Cialfo shares, 'We have partnered with PikoHANA to manage
various business processes as well as corporate reporting and
compliance. PikoHANA spearheaded the establishment of our company's
accounting and finance best practices. With a team of dedicated
professionals who had an in-depth understanding of our business,
PikoHANA empowered us with the ability to respond quickly to new
business demands. This enabled us to focus on executing strategies and
scale with peace of mind.'

William from Konsyg shares, 'PikoHANA has been with us since our
founding. PikoHANA has allowed Konsyg to focus 100% on our core skill
set. We have been able to exist in complete peace, being able to trust
that PikoHANA 'has our back'.

William adds that PikoHANA has helped him and his team get a better
understanding of how the company runs from a back-office perspective.
'PikoHANA is leading the charge in ensuring our staffing matters in
terms of payroll, filings, and structural matters are met in real-time.
I couldn't imagine running this company without PikoHANA there, it would
be nearly impossible,' he says.

PikoHANA's fractional finance model covers more than just taxes and
corporate returns. Their model encompasses anything connected to finance
from CFO advisory, bookkeeping, accounts keeping, payroll, invoicing,
vendor payments, etc. — essentially anything an in-house finance team
does without taking care of both managing and training. The company's
differentiator is that they do all the low-value work for a reasonable
price and on the side, they give good guidance and advice to help
businesses grow and scale.

with HPE[11]

'One of our goals is to be the leading college and career guidance
platform in Southeast Asia, India and China. With PikoHANA's support, we
were able to replicate and roll out best practices at scale in each of
these regions, thereby giving a positive experience and leaving a
striking impression on our clients and associates,' says Evalyn from
Cialfo.

With a core focus on SMEs with less than 50 employees, PikoHANA puts
together a dedicated team for each client where there's an assigned
account manager with a response time of under 30 minutes (email, phone
or zoom) and as many experts as needed, enabling startups to scale and
expand easily.

If you are looking for a concierge, hands-on fractional finance team to
support your growth and help with incorporating your business in
Singapore, visit PikoHANA[12] to learn more. PikoHANA also offers
incorporation services in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, as well as
fractional finance services for companies incorporated elsewhere.

Thriving without investments in the post-COVID era

While funding is a perquisite for startups, sometimes it can hamper the
entrepreneur's ability to steer his venture in the desired direction.
Instead, bridge financing could be a good option for the long haul.

Startups raising big funds over the years and collective months have
become a major point of celebration. Startups that have raised funds
have been put under the spotlight and are at the centre of conversations
and major headlines.

Too often, the fundraising element of a startup's journey is given so
much applause that it often masquerades the desired outcome of that
startup, which is building a successful business, constant innovation of
their products, and building a profitable and sustainable business
model.

Entrepreneurs should be applauded not just for raising funds but also
for the value, innovation and passion they create with their service or
product. To some extent, yes, raising capital is a growth indicator that
validates the growth of startups.

But, CB Insights-conducted research showcased how only 29 percent of
startup failures can be attributed to them not raising capital or
because they have run out of cash. If we take a closer look at the CB
Insights' report, the other 71 percent of a startup's failure is
attributed to the startup pioneering a product that is not needed by the
market, hiring of a faulty team, cost and pricing issues, etc. Clearly
indicative of how other metrics in a business often get overlooked with
the fundraise cloud swarming thick in the forefront.

The fuss over fundraise

Raising a huge round of funds should not always be a cause for
celebration, although, initially it may bring in freedom to execute an
idea, it always comes with strings attached.

If entrepreneurs venture into startup ecosystem with the mindset of only
raising funds, then they will have mistakenly set themselves up for
giving up more of their venture than they bargained for by the time they
reach series B or series C.

Especially with the onset of the pandemic, large and average ticket size
funds are no longer available to startups, and average ticket size of
those deals across sectors fell by 17.2 percent, a YourStory report
showed. If there is one thing this pandemic has taught the startup
ecosystem, it is to refine themselves into a lean business with a sharp
focus on products and to grow without risking one's control over their
destiny.

Fundings and their impact

When the funds by the entrepreneur are organically grown, they tend to
manoeuver through really hard decisions when it comes to expenditure.
Through this process, every idea is vetted and tested, so that the
decisions will be far more measured and the resultant impact too will
determine the startup's trajectory.

The alternative is to take calculated risks and raise money when there
is a clear use for it. Unfortunately, startups so far have been wired to
completely rely on funds to survive. Even though a complete bootstrapped
startup is unheard of, complete bootstrapping is the kind of reality
that is difficult to attain and practice.

Therefore in a world where we become borrowers, what we can practice is
becoming strategic and mindful borrowers. For example, laying out a
concrete plan in terms of the kind of funds we want to borrow, how much,
and from whom. These filters used in the decision heavily impact an
entrepreneur's future choices of financing options and worst-case
scenario, their exits.

Each time a business raises money at a valuation higher than itself, it
automatically blocks itself from a choice of options. Investors may set
their immediate priorities on the startup that may derail or burn them
out of their initial vision.

Investors introduce these priorities as they are bound by the payoff
from the investment. Raising a huge round of funding may not be an ideal
practice for startups to get used to, as they burn off on more than what
is required and risk themselves of insolvency, especially if their
business model is not highly profitable.

A case for bridge capital finance

Bridge capital finance, also known as bridge financing, is a form of
temporary, interposed funding intended to cover a business's short-term
expenses.

For example, global spending on compliance and regulatory expenses is
pegged at around $270 billion. For a fintech startup, the complication
surrounding compliances is enhanced by the fact that the industry lacks
specific guidelines to govern unique and innovative business models. In
order to meet these costs, bridge capital financing can be the ideal
segue for expenses that early stage fintech startups may have to incur.

Bridge capital financing is the type of financing which is most normally
used to fulfil a company's short-term working capital needs. A startup
that is in a relatively concrete position may have more options than a
seed-stage startup who may have to rely on temporary financing in order
to build a product and showcase proof of success.

Bridge funds, if provided at the right time to the startups, can
facilitate them enough funding to not only ensure their survival but
often to help its product and prepare itself for larger investments,
which is a primary consideration for tech startups with complex and
unpredictable product design processes.

Some other benefits that bridge financing can provide for early stage
startups include:

Speed

Swift processing and immediate fund accessibility make bridge financing
a sensible option for early stage startups who need an influx to
continue in build mode and meet their short-term requirements. While
venture funds may have several rounds of due diligence before even
offering a fundraise, with bridge financing the duration is
significantly shorter.

Stake

Bridge financing is smart way for early stage concept stage startups to
preserve stake in their organisation for as long as possible as they
ready themselves for the market and raise funds without any pressure on
performance, enabling them to have full control over their vision coming
to life.

Survival

Very often, startups may get off to a great beginning; however, they end
up meeting an untimely demise because they are not ready enough for
venture capital funds to find them interesting but they have already
made some headway in terms of building up their idea. It is at this
critical stage of survival that bridge financing can turn out to be a
boon for startups.

Bridge financing can be an effective way to avoid cash burn in myriad
areas and instead shift focus to optimising spends such that it enables
the founders to improve operations and ensure smooth functioning in the
run up to becoming a mature business and deriving real measurable value.

It also ensures that the business has sound performance metrics based on
realistic benchmarks that are not created under any kind of pressure to
perform or drive ROI. Instead, it enables entrepreneurs to maintain a
steady gaze on building a lasting successful venture that would
automatically garner interest and funding when the time is right and at
the right value, creating a win-win situation for founders and investors
alike.

Conviva: New Streaming Data Shows Ads Continue To Falter, Roku Has
Radically Improved Performance And Overall Streaming Viewing Climbs

FOSTER CITY, California, Feb. 4 -- Conviva issued the following news
release:

- Conviva's Quarterly State of Streaming Report Details Which Regions
are Embracing Streaming, Social Video Performance and Why Google Owns
Mobile Video

Conviva, the leader in global streaming media intelligence, released its
quarterly State of Streaming report for Q4 2019 today, revealing
streaming viewing continues to climb - up 58% year over year - as
consumers are motivated by new streaming services like Disney+ and Apple
TV+ and the convenience of on demand versus live streaming (66% of
global streaming viewing is now on demand).

Advertisers Still Struggling with Streaming Quality

Conviva analyzed more than 11 billion ad attempts in Q4 2019 and found
that while streaming ads are slowly improving in quality, the length of
time a viewer must wait for the ad to start nearly doubled, going from
1.14 to 2.27 seconds over the span of a single quarter. As a result,
viewers are more likely than ever to exit an ad, with exits before an ad
starts surging 49%. Conviva found ad buffering also remains an issue
with a 48% increase quarter over quarter.

In slightly more positive findings, 36.5% of streaming ad attempts
failed to play as intended in Q4 2019, down from 39.6% last quarter. Ad
start failures also improved, going from 35.7% in Q3 to 30.8% in Q4.
Advertisers are also shortening their ads, with average time down from
38 seconds in Q3 to 26.6 seconds in Q4.

"From recent entrants like Disney+ to soon-to-be-launched services like
NBC's Peacock and HBO Max, we've barely begun to scratch the surface of
streaming's impact not only on consumer behavior, but also on the
multi-billion dollar advertising and entertainment industries," said
Bill Demas, CEO, Conviva. "As with any disruptive technology, growing
pains are inevitable. The companies that win the streaming wars will be
those able to offer viewers a fast, clear, reliable experience
regardless of where in the world they live, or what device they use."

Roku Radically Improves Performance; Continues to Lead Device Category

Roku, a company whose market share remained steady in Q4 2019 with 43%
of all connected TV viewing time, markedly improved performance in the
past year, providing viewers with a more consistent and high-quality
viewing experience.

In Q4 2019 Roku (as compared to Q4 2018):

* Reduced video start failures by 56%

* Reduced video start times by 12%

* Reduced buffering by 34%

* Improved bitrate/picture quality by 25%

Fire TV, the second-largest player in the device category with 18% of
the connected TV market, reduced video start failures by 15% and
buffering by 9%. However, Fire TV's video start times increased 15% as
compared with Q4 2018. Apple TV, which holds 9% of the connected TV
market, still leads with the fastest start time, but saw increases in
both video start times and video start failures, up by 25% and 19%
respectively.

Streaming Grows Internationally; Asia Ripe for More Streaming Adoption

Streaming is growing rapidly not just in the United States, but also
around the world. Streaming viewing is up 63% in the Americas year over
year and 65% in Europe. Streaming growth in Asia is slower, showing just
a 10% increase year over year. However, it's worth noting the connected
TV market in Asia only accounts for 2% in viewing hours, but netted 243%
growth year over year, as compared to growth on mobile or PC devices in
Asia, which inched up just 11% and 6% respectively.

The Americas experienced the lowest rate of video start failures at
.51%, the lowest rate of buffering at .31% and the best bitrate (picture
quality) at 5.94 Mbps. Asia claims the world's fastest video start time
at 2.58 seconds while Europe lags behind in many quality categories,
including the highest percentage of video start failures at 1.63%.

Android Dominates Mobile Streaming Viewing

Nearly a quarter, 24%, of all streaming time is spent on a mobile
device, and Google's Android phones represent the majority with a 60%
share of the mobile devices used. Google is followed by two Apple
products-the iPhone at 26% and iPad at 14% share. This represents a 47%
increase year over year for Android phones and an 84% increase for the
iPhone.

Social Video Core to News and Sports Organizations

Compared to Q4 2018, in Q4 2019 news organizations created 23% more
videos on average across all social platforms as they leverage video on
social platforms to boost audience engagement. Facebook in particular
saw a sharp increase in live video content from news organizations as
they posted 28% more live videos on average. Facebook also saw a 125%
increase of average views per news video compared from Q4 2018 to Q4
2019. Overall, Facebook accounted for nearly 60% of all video views by
major news organizations on social media platforms in 2019.

Professional sports teams also enjoyed a banner year on social with a
game plan of more quality over quantity, increasing their average
cross-platform views per video by 33% and engagements per video by 40%
despite posting 9% less video content in Q4 2019 as compared to Q4 2018.
Sports organizations saw the largest increase of average engagements per
video (Q4 2018 vs. Q4 2019), growing on Instagram by 50% and YouTube by
47%. Instagram drove the most views for professional sports teams with
46% of their total views during 2019.

Methodology

Data for Conviva's State of Streaming report was primarily collected
from Conviva's proprietary sensor technology currently embedded in three

Rafale deal: Money laundering and BJP

Pakistan Observer

July 12, 2021 Monday

Section: Vol. 32; No. 191

NO one in India was aware about the philosophy behind Prime Minister
Narindra Modi's boast that, had there been Rafale with Indian Air Force
(IAF), Pakistan Air Force (PAF) could not have targeted and fallen two
Indian aircrafts on February 27, 2019.

During his address at a public gathering at Ahmedabad, PM Modi said, 'If
IAF had Rafale during the air strikes then India wouldn't have lost
anything and Pakistan wouldn't have anything left.'

Indeed, no one among the Indian masses, no intellectual or general among
the audience corrected Prime Minister Modi that, 'It's not the gun but
man behind the gun who matters'.

The American statesman Theodore Roosevelt explained this entire
relationship in the wordings; 'The truth is that any good modern rifle
is good enough. The determining factor is the man behind the gun.

By emphasizing the significance of Rafale, Mr Modi was indeed,
underestimating the professionalism of Indian Air Force. Very recently,
the same viewpoint was reinforced by General BiponRawat, who gauged the
role of IAF like a supporting arm for Indian Army.

Indeed, a year after the first batch of Rafale was formally inducted
into Indian Air Force; there is no worthwhile change in the combat
worthiness of IAF.

Rather, two parallel sets of controversies have started in India over
the Indian Government Rafale Deal with French Government and a war of
words between Indian Chief of Defence Staff and Indian Chief of Air
Staff over the actual role of IAF in Indian Joint Warfare.

It is intimated that Indian military is undergoing a massive reforms
system which include; modernization of weapon system and theaterisation
of command structure.

The modernization of all three services consists of; bolstering and
speeding-up the combat worthiness of all three services in a time period
of 5-7 years.

This includes; modernisation of all critical weapons, missiles, fighter
jets, submarines and warships either through new purchases like Rafale
or indigenous production.

This is being done through 'mega procurement plan which would cost over
$130 billion in less than a decade's time, starting from 2019.' The
theaterisation of command in Indian Military is being done on the line
of Chinese PLA.

As perceived by Gen Bipon Rawat, the Indian CDS, there will be five
unified theatre commands of all three services, aiming to; achieve
better planning, quick military response and a joint/ unified approach
for fighting the future war.

The blue print of this threaterisation has met difference among three
services, involving wider political circle; Modi's BJP and other
political parties.

Indeed, the sceptics quote Liddell Hart saying over these massive
reforms, who once said, 'The only thing harder than getting a new idea
into the military mind is to get the old one out.'

General Rawat is trying to modernize and threaterise Indian military
through a traditional and neurotic approach which is non-starter in its
entirety.

It is worth mentioning that, Indian Military Modernization has failed
many a time in the past four decades, the prominent being the Cold Start
Doctrine, the brainchild of General KrishnaswamySundarji.

As the Army Chief of Indian Army General Rawat tried to re-activate the
Cold Start Doctrine, however it ended up as failure in a rapidly
changing environment of modern battlefield.

Modi's philosophy behind necessity of having Rafale for IAF which could
have countered the broad day light targeting of Indian aircrafts on
February 27, 2019 has many mysteries, now unfolding one by one.

Indeed, the deal for the purchase of 126 Rafale manufactured by Dassault
Aviation of France was initiated in 2004 and processed in 2007.

It was almost final in 2014, once there was a change of the Government
in India with Modi as the new Prime Minister.

In April 2015, in a period of less than one year of BJP Government,
Prime Minister Modi ordered cancellation of the deal without assigning
any explanation.

Indeed, during his visit of France in April 2015, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi had a meeting with French President, Francois Hollande and
decided to replace the original Rafale deal of 126 aircrafts with just
36 aircrafts, all were to be made in France by Dassault.

The famous Indian capitalist Anil Ambani of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai
Ambani Group (Reliance ADAG) later became the of-set partner of
Dassault. After replacement of the deal by PM Modi, Randeep Surjewala,
leader of Indian Congress party disclosed in 2017 that procurement of
the Rafale has bypassed the procedure of acquisition of aircrafts with
some veiled motives.

It was also revealed that, the new deal has substantially escalated the
cost of aircrafts; from Rs 526.1 crore to Rs 1,570 crore.

While the Indian Government had managed to hide the commission, it
received from Dassault, the French anti-corruption agency Agence
Française Anticorruption (AFA) found financial anomaly in the deal.

'The agency's (AFA) inspectors found that Dassault had agreed to pay one
million euros to a middleman just after the 2016 signing of the Rafale
fighter jet deal. That middleman is now accused of money laundering in
India in another defence deal.

The company said the money was used to pay for the manufacture of 50
large replica models of Rafale jets.' The corruption in the Rafale Deal
by BJP Government under Modi has been proved by AFA, France.

Apart from the commission, Modi Government received from Dassault, there
are many other aspects which emerged as a result of initial probe of the
deal.

The most significant aspect is the money laundering, a subject of
Financial Action Task Force (FATF), whose headquarters is in Paris,
France.

Should this inter-governmental organisation probe the Indian money
laundering cases, revealed as a result of probe by AFA of France?

Ethical dilemmas at the workplace: what to do?

e27

August 15, 2019 Thursday 5:05 AM EST

Byline: Marina Pilipenko

Aug 15, 2019( e27: http://www.e27.sg Delivered by Newstex) How to tackle
ethical dilemmas that arise in the workplace Professional behaviour
often differs from our everyday behaviour patterns. At work, you have to
be friendly and polite in situations where you'd be bursting with temper
outside of work. At work, you mostly need to keep emotions (and
sometimes opinions) to yourself. It's more complicated if you're a
manager.

Maintaining afunctional work environment[1]is your responsibility, and
you have to find constructive ways to address performance issues,
work-related problems, and employee behaviour. Here's where workplace
ethics comes into play. Being different from our everyday life ethics,
it can cause dissonance between what you want to do and what you should
do. Below, we've collected the most common ethical dilemmas that people
face at work - and have to solve.Dilemma: What to mention and what to
omit at a job interview?Ethical dilemmas can appear already at the job
interview, especially if you have a not so perfect employment history.
Should you mention you were fired from your previous position? How to
explain why it happened? Making up a perfect cover story is tempting,
but what if the employer finds out the truth? Even if you don't have a
history of firings and workplace conflicts, there can be doubts about
what to say to your potential employer. For example, when asked why you
left your previous job, the first sentence that probably comes to your
mind is 'I escaped a viper nest'. But how can you be honest about the
actual reasons for leaving and not come across as unprofessional, rude
and overly demanding? Also Read:Poor business ethics, lack of innovation
are key reasons for failure of startups in India: IBM study[2]SolutionBe
upfront about important facts about your previous employment. What you
liked, what you disliked and why you left. Even if you don't get a job
or get fired, it doesn't mean you're a bad person who should never work
again. If you committed a mistake, emphasise on the fact that you
learned your lesson. That said, resist the urge of involving emotions:
be mindful about the words you choose. Just be aware of the good and the
bad at your previous workplace.Dilemma: Running a personal business at
the workplaceHaving aside hustle[3]is not a crime (at least as long as
it doesn't violate your employment contract). Many have one. Sometimes,
it can require your urgent attention while you're at your day job. You
have obligations to both employers, so what to do? Or, say, a friend
just sent you a link to a gorgeous dress from an online shop, and now
you're studying the entire summer collection on their website, while
your day is ticking away. You are just disconnecting from the dull
routine. Nothing illegal, but somehow doesn't feel right.SolutionMake
sure to separate your side hustle from your primary job. Don't take on
side projects that would require your immediate attention through your
regular workday. Keep in mind that it will jeopardise your reputation
sooner or later. As for googling something personal during your work
hours, using your work phone for personal calls, or printing out your
stuff with a company-owned printer, review what your company's policies
say about using company-owned resources, and strictly follow
them.Dilemma: Should I report the inappropriate behaviour of a
colleague?It's your coworker you're friends with, and they are rude to
clients. Or using racial slurs, or bragging about how they violated the
company's policies and had zero consequences. Usually, it's supposed
that behaviour like this should be reported, but since it is your friend
you never want to snitch on them. The dilemma doesn't necessarily
involve friendship though. You might be afraid of the consequences of
reporting a manager's behaviour or trying not to be petty. The frequent
choice is not reporting - but is it right? Also Read:5 elements of
company culture that will keep your business moving[4]SolutionNot
reporting inappropriate behaviour is nurturing it. Addressing it timely
is the appropriate way to handle it: talking to the offender personally,
or initiating a formal procedure with a manager or HR department -
reporting rudeness, policy violations, sexual harassment, racism, or
other severe issues is essential to keep a work environment functional
and inclusive.Dilemma: How do I address unprofessionalism?Now it's your
employee, and they burst into tears after hearing that you are not happy
with their performance, even asking you not to give them feedback. Or
it's a summer intern who would always choose the least appropriate topic
for a water cooler talk and never notice the sudden awkward silence. Or
an employee who never misses a chance to police others for clothes and
tattoos. Or, say, an otherwise lovely person who is dropping F-bombs
over and over again. The problem is, you'd be happy to have them stop
all of it, but you have no idea how to explain basic things like this.
Or you don't want to be that grumpy person no one wants to communicate
to. Or it's something that seems not so severe and perfectly excusable.
How to handle it?SolutionIn most cases, people don't realise they're
doing or saying something wrong until someone addresses it. This is
especially true for interns and young employees at their first
post-college job, who didn't have a chance to adopt professional norms.
So you need to get rid of the 'if I ignore it, it will go away' mindset
and be transparent with your employees and interns about their
behaviour. The key point is being kind and willing to help: frame it as
something that will block them from great jobs and networking
opportunities in the future - and keep in mind you're doing them a
favour by addressing their lack of professionalism as early as
possible.Dilemma: How do I admit I've committed a mistake?You're on the
IT team, and you've granted access to confidential data to someone who's
not supposed to have it. Or you've sent your valued customer's invoice
(with a decent discount!) to another customer who's paying regular
price, and now both are not excited, to say the least. Or you've messed
up the client database, and no one can use it. Plot twist: no one knows
it was you. What to do? Silently wait until it settles up or admitting
it was your fault? They say it's okay, to be honest, but in real life,
penalties are highly likely as soon as the culprit is caught. And you
don't want any penalties.SolutionIt can sound hard and disappointing,
but admitting the mistake is the best way to handle the problem. The
sooner the problem is known, the better is the chances to minimise its
consequences. Besides, getting in even more trouble if they find out it
was your mistake is not what you're aiming at. Be honest, and make it
clear that you've learned an important lesson from your mistake and it's
guaranteed that you'll never commit it again.Dilemma: I disagree with
management's decision - what do I do? Your grand boss appointed a new
manager in your department, and you realise they're the least competent
person at their job. Or work you dislike and are bad at has been
assigned to you and saying no is not an option. Or your coworker
overshared a bit and you've learned they have received a better bonus
than you, despite the fact that you've been working harder. How to
address it? Also Read:Play nice, be friendly, add
value[5]SolutionActually, there's no 'how-to' for solving this dilemma:
each case is individual. The good news is, it's always a chance to make
an important decision and improve the quality of at least your work
life. You can keep the disagreement to yourself and continue enjoying
the benefits of your job, or suggest a better solution, or speak up as a
group with your coworkers and influence the unpopular decision. -

Fintech gives fillip to jobs and funding in Singapore financial sector;
MAS wants to spur enterprise financing for growth firms, and is on the
lookout for a sustained rate in the creation of startups

Singapore

SINGAPORE'S move to develop the fintech sector came at a critical
juncture, a time of weakness in traditional job creation in the
financial industry, and just as the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) was intent on spurring enterprise financing for growth companies,
MAS' managing director Ravi Menon has said.

Some 2,000 jobs have been created in the fintech sector over the last
two years, feeding into a net increase of 7,800 jobs in financial
services and fintech - close to the financial services' Industry
Transformation Map (ITM) target of 8,000 jobs. MAS now expects job
growth in financial services to exceed the ITM target this year.

Being able to hit the fresh ITM targets was a pleasant surprise, said Mr
Menon, who noted that the main drivers came from jobs related to digital
technology and associated areas such as cyber security.

Speaking to The Business Times in an interview ahead of the Singapore
Fintech Festival next week, he said: "If you look at the traditional
areas in the financial industry globally, jobs have generally been cut
back.

"So I think this fintech phenomenon has been most timely. It has created
demand for many new technology-related jobs in the financial industry,
offsetting the cutbacks in other areas."

This comes as the financial industry has experienced not just slower
economic growth globally, but also tighter regulation and keen
competition from non-financial technology players.

Mr Menon told BT as well that the financing activity for startups has
picked up. Today, there are some 220 venture capital (VC) and private
equity (PE) managers in Singapore; VC and PE assets under management in
Singapore has grown at an average of 28 per cent per annum over the last
five years. And as a sign of the interest in Asia, more than
three-quarters of their investments are across Asean, South and North
Asia.

Singapore has in recent times simplified the regulatory regime for
venture capital managers, shortening the authorisation process from 16
weeks to four.

In a speech at the GIC Institutional Investors Roundtable, Mr Menon said
MAS would go further to boost enterprise financing. It is working with
the financial industry to develop a utility service for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which would aggregate information to
help these smaller companies show their credit worthiness at the pre-IPO
phase.

MAS also plans to create private market platforms so Asian growth
companies can connect with investors for capital and expertise.

To boost the research coverage for both private and public markets, MAS
is curating Asean VC and PE research with industry partners, and funding
research to support market liquidity in the post-IPO phase.

These developments prompt the question of how sustainable the startup
sector can be, given that most startups can, and do, fail. But Mr Menon
noted that the aim is to ensure a constant thrum in the sector.

"If you look at the major innovation hubs, failure rates are, by nature,
high. But people just move on to do new things. The capabilities don't
die, they get sharpened by experience and failure.

"That's why the failure of startups shouldn't bother us. What should
bother us is if the rate of new startups being created is slackening."

While encouraging fintech firms to disrupt the incumbents in the
financial-services sector, MAS is also watching keenly how traditional
jobs at financial institutions will be transformed for the digital age.

Mr Menon observed that chief executives of banks here are concerned that
some staff are not adapting quickly enough to change, raising the
question on whether some degree of anxiety should be injected to prevent
complacency in this regard.

A recent Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) survey of 1,028
financial professionals found that most felt technology could drive
efficiencies, including replacing repetitive activities with automation.
Yet, while two in five find it important to pick up new skills for the
digital economy, they also find no urgency to do so.

But although this is the case, the government said last year that
financial institutions should not be too quick to fire their employees
as a "tendency", and in the name of disruption.

MAS has been taking deep dives to look at how jobs would be transformed
for the digital age, right down to the specific skills that are needed
for the roles at financial institutions.

In August, the IBF launched its one-stop career centre, designed to
offer training to tackle skill gaps.

Estimates for at-risk jobs in Singapore are hard to pin down now, but
major consumer banks were asked last year to retrain some 3,500 existing
employees within three years. To date, about a third of these have been
trained, including 450 who have moved into new roles.

Mr Menon said: "Job displacements and entirely new jobs occur more at
the fringes. Rather, what we see more often is job transformation. Most
jobs are going to be changed.

"The challenge is to figure out what is the likely configuration of new
roles and displaced roles within existing jobs and to equip our
workforce for it."

The Singapore Fintech Festival 2018 will be held from Nov 12 to Nov 16
at the Singapore Expo, and will be attended by top government officials
and business leaders. Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime
Minister of India Narendra Modi and the managing director of the
International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde are among the attendees.

Graphic

Mr Menon says the main drivers in job creation came from jobs in digital
technology and associated areas such as cyber security.

Time and time again we hear of, or witness, start-up businesses'
failures; or even worse, huge companies or projects crashing after
cruising in 'business paradise'. Like first-time walking toddlers, it is
natural that all entities or initiatives have their fair share of
ground-tasting. Just as some valley-of-death scenarios can be
overpowering, numerous others can be avoided or at least controlled.

The solution? 'Strategising' - knowing and working on where you are now
(your current situation), where you want to be, and how you will get
there. By simply but painstakingly going through the right processes to
decide on the appropriate questions to ask, asking them and implementing
the answers to the Whats, Whos, Whys and Whens, companies can when ready
move from growing 'organically', to being vertically catapulted up and
above their peers. If you know where you are going your chances of
getting there are higher. Will implementing these move you toward your
core goals, and will it be easier said than done? Your guess is as good
as mine.

1 "Know your enemies and know yourself and you can fight a hundred
battles without disaster."

Apart from the fact that every single business or project has its own
space (internal and external), there exists an encapsulating box which
contains all that is needed by each and every other business. Each
business, each project, each programme, each industry, and even the
environment has the right, at different scales, to converge toward every
single element available within this capsule.

And mind you, even your internal space is not spared from this web I
call the 'Business War'. Each idea could be another's thought; employees
could be poached; services delivered exclusively well by the next firm;
and products made with the same specifications - anyone could discover
the blueprint of the next big thing!

Grasping Corporate & Business Strategy

As leaders and team players, having a clear perspective of what
strategising is in itself very difficult, multi-part and complex; and we
first find an answer in the mere listing of its characteristics here.
Secondly, we have evidently never been able to holistically capture the
main blueprint for guidance: its definition.

Another point to be raised is why companies in Africa - West Africa or
Ghana for that matter - should be operating strictly based on theories
that were formulated far away across the world without going through the
vital process of tailoring to fit. Does distance and the hidden factors
that crop up with it not matter? Finally, but not lastly, is seeing some
managers simply and solely relying on outdated processes.

Having past traditional and contemporary scholars in the business world
taking steps backward to study historical strategic lessons - of Sun
Tsu's 'The Art of War', mechanisms of Alexander the Great and Napoleon -
over time only reveals among all the theories that the corporate world
is a battlefield; and deciding to be in it means taking a stand and
having opposing forces come at you no matter your purpose, point of
entry, age, armour or determination.

Great theorists like Michael Porter and Igor Ansoff have been viewed
taking strategy from different angles. To each, corporate or business
strategy comprises planning for and having well-structured intra- and
inter-functional cooperation, competitive advantage, cost-leadership,
relevant categorical analysis and assessments, etc.

Others have come up with main issues of strategy being having the
ability to provide the best product or service among your 'real'
competitors, or discover and deliver the exclusive customer needs or
desirable products and services, or fight to the 'death' for the market
share of already existing products/services. But, really, does doing
just one or even a multiplicity of any of these get you to your final
business-targetted destination?

Evolution of Strategy

The whole story of strategy has been and continues to be that of an
evolving style. The world is moving at a very fast pace, and huge deals
are now made by a mere click of a button. Almost all constant factors
are in this paradigm shift toward being variables. Any firm today - no
matter its size, however measurable - that is not constantly reassessing
and strengthening its winning strategy or redeveloping and
reconstructing its ailing one is in line for relegation or incineration.

Every corporate/business strategy should be a live document; it should
be fed when hungry, cleaned when dirty, and be allowed to walk
(implemented). But businesses are too fixated, and honestly don't have
that much time to deal with their operational ballyhoo let alone
something far-sighted. A point of reflection: "The notion that
businesses have to annually rejuvenate plans to remain in business in an
ascending manner is just too distracting and expensive".

Taking a good and hard look into your current situation, and the
future - and of course with the right analytical ingredients - gives a
good shot of anticipation with little margins of error. It is the
pursuit of undertaking these steps that presents the complexity and
difficulties of strategising to businesses and institutions.

Strategic Thinking, Decisions and Plans

As organisations typically struggle with issues on whether they ought to
be Planning on decisions made or deciding based on plans made, let's
face it: in business, firms and institutions never really completely
win, but there are definitely always winners.

Many initiatives and their strategies are ignited by a vision; and while
it is the prime factor, businesses have to be sure not to be put in the
blind-spot of necessary market realism. Your vision must be a solid
foundation on which to build, but must not restrict the flow-level of
your business so that it would eventually be prevented from growing. It
has to be well-accommodating for the biggest possible breakthrough in
future.

For example, remember the all incredible times of Blockbuster movies
with your family and loved ones, or the times you just had to have or
rely on yahoo? Or perchance the period within which the main means of
corporate and private communiqué was by BBM, and all and sundry wanted
to know everyone's PIN.

It was the phone to have in the mid- to late-2000s, and the super
'BlackBerry' had in 2007 more than half the market share of phones in
the US. Well, on August 29, 1997, Netflix was founded; Google was born
on September 4th 1998; and on the 29th of June 2007, the iPhone was
released. Blockbuster movies, Blackberry, yahoo become prisoners and
casualties of the business war, because 1"the art of war teaches us to
rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own
readiness to receive him; and not on the chance of his not attacking,
but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable".

The Dynamism of Strategy: Changes in its Form and Style

Now, one major factor that keeps entrepreneurs and businesses on their
toes at all times is competition. That competitor who exists within your
space and is at all times thinking about what to do better and best
(with you in mind), just as you do about them, and is probably - apart
from thinking how you think and doing what you do - does better on some
factor to factor basis like product or service delivery.

The old form of generic strategy might not quite go beyond where there
is business 'self-actualisation' levels of core competence.  Strategy
has over recent years taken on a new meaning in response to the
ever-changing business ecosystem. The era when businesses saw their
competitors and other businesses as 'die-hard' enemies and threats are
long gone. Why? Well, because your competitors are external factors -
and its within that setting that opportunities also thrive. Why carve
out a threat at your disadvantage where there lies a chance to craft an
opportunity?

A new form of strategy has evolved, referred to as the "Remix Strategy"
by Gomes-Casseres; and even though the remixing of businesses is not a
new phenomenon, with early sightings made of Joseph Schumpeter's works,
business strategy is creating tremendous value by being turned
outside-in. This approach widens the unit of analysis previously
restricted to competitive advantage that came from internal resources
and activities of the business or corporation in the case of the
traditional approach, to simply the combination of resources which yield
value.

That combination competes with other combinations - and while some will
gain advantage over others because they incorporate just the right
resources, others will gain advantage because they manage their
collective resources better than others do. The right combination of
resources yields competitive advantage; hence, we see firms partnering
with their competitors to gain competitive advantage in specific
products and services.

Would the word 'frenemies' better describe the current evolving stage of
strategy wherein businesses make friends from their 'enemies'
(competitors)? This might have seemed too farfetched to early strategic
thinkers. Consumers are in a constant search for ingenuity, for whatever
it is that will make their lives easier to match-up with the growing
pace of life and living it. And it is from what this external
opportunity presents that brilliant initiatives are recently observed -
like the new big kid, the Fintech industry; or the recently observed
'collabos' of Insurance Companies and Telcos with the Banks; as well as
Restaurants, Manufacturers, shops/retailers with courier services and so
on.

And why not, the almighty Mercedes is trying coffee delivery by drone to
beat traffic; there are 'coffee-copters' Uber is joining forces with
NASA for 'UBERAIR' - flying taxis that take off vertically by just 2020;
and Google, in its quest to avoid the fate of businesses it replaced, is
sticking its neck out and doing Moonshots.

Recognise the one common conspicuous factor in all these? Technology! Be
sure not to brush technology under the carpet. Your ability to identify
the resources of your competitor and that business around the corner
which best complements yours to deliver value for the customers in a
specific market space may be what will win you the game. With all these,
I guess the question that sums it all up is "would you rather hold a
full bowl of 100 units or enjoy a half-bowl with millions of units?"

Having an Implementation Plan:

1 "Victorious warriors win first and then go to war." Strategy without
tactics is the unhurried course to success. But tactics without strategy
is the noise before defeat. Going back to the time you called the front
desk of that organisation that humid afternoon, when the phone kept
ringing with no reply; or the time when the waiter or waitress had no
clue of the menu he/she was handing to you; the rude sales girl, or the
product that made you feel like you had been duped after using it; or
perhaps asking the questions "Why that  failed merger? Why we are not
hearing of that company anymore?" Or "Why don't I see that product on
the market anymore?" These could all be outcomes of lacking
comprehensive business strategies, or the inability of firms to properly
execute their business strategies.

There is a need to ensure that strategy implementation processes are
properly developed outward in the 'SMARTest' possible ways, and with no
allowance for trial and errors, to ease actual implementation. Strategy
has traditionally been a higher-level management affair, but its
evolution has taught even the think-tanks to be extra mindful of
developments that hover around the lower sections.

When Infosys Limited had a vision of getting its staff up to speed with
the fast-changing trends of the IT industry in which they operate, it
considered innovative measures to establish their internal training
programme (of course, constant training is a norm for an IT firm).

However, the firm got its team to visit flight schools and see how
professional pilots are taught to deal with split-second, first-hand,
fast-changing situations. They stated that "problems have to be solved
on the fly", and of course you can't drag your feet when you are the
3rd-largest IT firm in an IT knowledge-hub like India. And when you have
huge companies like the Goldman Sachs Group and Philips N.V. hire you
for fast executions, "Take-offs are optional but landing is mandatory".

Finally

Introducing change for good will in itself attract some resistance, even
internally. Implementing new or revised strategies starts from the
development of that strategy and having to predict the reactions to your
actions by all that will be affected in any way. For reasons of culture
and the presumed norms of the organisation, those who would benefit
while still on the blind-side might even be at the high table
championing resistance - and therefore creating another avenue to be
considered.

If you don't know where you are going and don't have any means of
transport that can get you there, you might end up taking the seemingly
comfortable walk trail to smell the roses and throw stones at chained
dogs that bark at you. Strategy is about being prepared for the moment
that need not be missed for an action to be taken without vital time
being lost through hesitation. 1"…defeated warriors go to war and then
seek to win"

New Delhi, Feb. 12 -- This article was originally published on Medium by
Sahil Lavingia, the Founder and CEO of Gumroad.

In 2011 I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest-before I
vested any of my stock-to work on what I thought would be my life's
work.

Just had an idea for my first billion-dollar company. Tomorrow, I start
building it.

- Sahil Lavingia (@shl) April 2, 2011

Blockchain and cryptocurrency news minus the bullshit.

Visit Hard Fork. CLICK IT

Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of
employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something
like that.

That didn't happen.

Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a
profitable, growing, and low-maintenance software business with
customers who adore us. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At
my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including
many of my best friends. I had failed.

I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today. It
took me years to realize that I was misguided from the outset. This is
that journey, from the beginning. A weekend project turned VC-backed
startup

The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able
to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple
links. No need for a storefront.

I built Gumroad that weekend, and launched it early Monday morning on
Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000
people checked it out on the first day.

Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at
Pinterest-before I vested any of my stock-to turn it into what I thought
would become my life's work.

Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel
investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca,
Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and
First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M
more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), a
top-tier VC firm, led the round.

I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M
in the bank and three employees. And the world was starting to take
note.

We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers
started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn't.

To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company-including
many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things
would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from
the company would ever find out.

Then TechCrunch published Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup
Restructures. All of a sudden my failure was public. I spent the week
ignoring my support network and answering our customers' concerns, many
of whom relied on us to power their business and wanted to know if they
should look for an alternative after reading the news; some of our
favorite, most successful creators left. (It hurt, but I don't blame
them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.)

So what went wrong, and when? Failing in style

Let's start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, up
until the layoffs:

It doesn't look too bad, right? It's going in the right direction: up.

But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of
double-or-nothing. It's euphoric when things are going your way-and
suffocating when they're not. And we weren't doubling fast enough to
raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we looked
for to grow the team.

Every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.

For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less
than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.

But at the time, I thought: "It's okay." We had money in the bank, we
had product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things
would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; it wasn't
our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.

But now, I realize: It doesn't matter whose "fault" it is, we hit a peak
in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but
there weren't enough of them who needed our specific product offering.
Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to
justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until
acquisition or IPO).

In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, when our
bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway, I told the twenty-person
team: the road ahead was going to be a tough one. We didn't have the
numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over
the next nine months to get even close to them. To that end, we
deprioritized everything except features that would directly "move the
needle." Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try
everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it
needed to be.

If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire
more people, and start the journey again. If we didn't, we would have to
drastically downsize the company.

In those nine months, when the whole team knew that we were fighting for
our company's life, not a single person left Gumroad. From "this is
gonna be hard," to "yep, turns out it was," every single person worked
harder than ever.

We launched a "Small Product Lab" to teach new creators how to grow and
sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to
debit cards, payouts to the UK, Australia, and Canada, various additions
to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to
see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they've
purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just from August
to November.

Unfortunately, we didn't hit the numbers we needed. Slim down or shut
down?

Looking back, I'm glad we didn't hit those numbers. If we doubled down,
raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there was a very
real possibility it would only lead to a more spectacular failure.

With that off the table, our options were:

Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try
something new. Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to
aim for sustainability. Position the company for an acquihire.

Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to
convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small
business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another
billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings-and their money.

I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our
creators, our employees, and our investors-in that order. We helped
thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going
to go into the pockets of creators?-?for rent checks and mortgages, for
student loans and kids' college funds. And it was only growing! Could I
really just turn that faucet off?

And if I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team,
which means I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the
product. There were too many acquisition stories that promised exciting
journeys and amazing synergies to come-and ended with a deprecated
product a year later.

It was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise
more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn't sit
right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That's what I
told every new hire and every investor. I didn't want to become a serial
entrepreneur, and risk disappointing another customer base.

We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun:
I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find
a new tenant for our $25,000/month office and focused all of our
remaining resources on launching a premium service.

In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked
like this:

Revenue: $89,000 for the month Gross profit: $17,000 Operating expenses:
$364,000 Net profit: -$351,000

A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:

Revenue: $176,000 for the month Gross profit: $42,000 Operating
expenses: $32,000 Net profit: +$10,000

It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid, and that we were
in control of our own destiny. Skeleton crew to lifestyle business

It got worse from there.

Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our
investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other
opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.

I was basically alone. I didn't have a team, nor an office. And San
Francisco was full of startups raising gobs more money, building amazing
teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became
billionaires. Meanwhile, I had to run a "measly" lifestyle business. It
wasn't what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.

Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at
the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn't stop, but there was only so
much I could do as an army of one.

I shut off the rest of the world. I didn't tell my mom about the
layoffs-she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My
friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor
suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking
that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more
lonely.

Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad's support queries.
I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help
from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed now, but they
always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I
tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side
project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.

To me, happiness is so much about an expectation of positive change.
Every year before 2016, there was an improvement in my expectations-in
the team, the product, or the company-and this was the first time in my
life when the present year felt worse than the last.

Living in San Francisco was already a struggle, and when Trump won the
election, I ended up leaving for good. New beginnings

Then one day, everything changed. Again. I'm wary about sharing this
part of the story, because I don't know if there is anything to learn
from it. But it happened, so here it is.

On November 27, 2017 I got this email from KPCB, our lead investor:

I am following up our conversation a few months ago. KP would like to
sell our ownership back to Gumroad for $1. Can we discuss this week?

Mike had left KPCB to start a new company, and KPCB didn't want the
operational headache of appointing a new board member. Plus, it helped
their taxes. In one fell swoop, our liquidation preferences (how much we
would have to sell for before dollars started going to employees) went
from about $16.5M to $2.5M. All of a sudden, there was a light at the
end of the tunnel. Small, dim, and far away, but present. There was a
path to an independent business, not beholden to the go-big-or-go-home
mentality I signed up for when I raised money.

One investor joined them. We've bought back a couple more, since then. I
keep the rest of the investors up-to-date with a brief email every few
months.

The future came into focus: I could grow a small team, slowly buy back
our investors, and build Gumroad into a meaningful business focused on
our creators. We would never become a billion-dollar company, and that
started to feel okay. Certainly, the thousands of creators selling on
Gumroad wouldn't mind. Finding new forms of impact

The eight years I worked on Gumroad were full of personal ups and downs.
There were months where I worked 16 hours a day. But there were also
some months where I worked four hours a week. Here's one way to picture
that time:

Can you tell which is which? I can't. We had a sales team for a few
years, then we didn't. Can you tell when we made the switch? I can't.

It doesn't matter how amazing your product is, or how fast you ship
features. The market you're in will determine most of your growth. For
better or worse, Gumroad grew at roughly the same rate almost every
month because that's how quickly the market determined we would grow.

So instead of pretending to be some sort of product visionary, trying to
build a billion-dollar company, I'm just focused on making Gumroad
better and better for our existing creators. Because they are the ones
that have kept us alive. Creating and capturing value

At a CEO Summit many years ago, my all-time hero, Bill Gates, was on
stage. Someone asked him how he dealt with failing to capture so much
value? Microsoft was huge, sure, but tiny compared to the total impact
it has had on the world and on humanity.

Bill's answer: sure, but that's true with all companies, right? They
create some value and succeed in capturing a very small percentage of
it.

Similarly, I am now more focused on creating value than capturing it. I
still want to have as large an impact as possible, but I don't need to
create it directly, or capture it in the form of our revenue or our
valuation.

For example, Austen Allred, who's raised $48M for his startup Lambda
School, got his start selling a book on Gumroad.

I shifted my focus from selling my book (using Gumroad, the platform he
built) to growing a VC-backed company (which he invested in).

We still disagree on some things I'm sure, but everyone could learn a
lot and quickly by getting out of his or her bubble.

- Austen Allred (@Austen) February 7, 2018

Startups have been founded by former Gumroad employees, and dozens more
companies have been massively improved by recruiting our alumni.

On top of that, our product ideas, like our credit card form and
inline-checkout experience, have proliferated the web, making it a
better place for everyone-including those that have never used Gumroad.

While Gumroad, Inc may be small, our impact is large. There is, of
course, the $178,000,000 we have sent to creators. But then there's the
impact of the impact, the opportunities that those creators have taken
to create new opportunities for others. Opening up

I've found other ways to create value, too. After the layoffs, I didn't
talk to anyone about Gumroad. Not even my mom. And after moving away
from San Francisco, I felt pretty disconnected from the startup
community.

So, as a way to re-engage with the community, I thought about sharing
our financials publicly. Founders starting their own companies could
learn from our mistakes, utilizing our data to make better decisions.

It was scary: What if we don't grow every month? It could scare off
prospective customers. It's something I would never expect a startup
seeking venture capital to do. It makes sense to hold those cards as
close to your chest for as long as possible when you must raise money,
hire people, and compete for customers with other venture-seeking
startups.

But, since we were not any of those things anymore, it was easier to
share that information. We were profitable, and a no-growth month won't
change that. So in April 2018, I started to release our monthly
financials publicly.

Gumroad in April:

GMV: $4.2M (down 2 percent) Revenue: $273K (down 2 percent) Gross
profit: $65K (up 34 percent)

Let me know if you have any questions!

- Sahil Lavingia (@shl) May 14, 2018

Ironically, more investors have reached out (we're just interested in
raising money from our customers for the moment, thanks!), more folks
want to contribute to Gumroad, and our shift in focus has brought us
closer to our creators.

Instead of freaking out about how 'small' Gumroad actually is (like I
thought they would), our creators have grown more loyal. It feels like
we're all in this together, trying to do earn a living doing what we
love.

Soon, we will also open-source the whole product, WordPress-style.
Anyone will be able to deploy their own version of Gumroad, make the
changes they want, and sell the content they want, without us being the
middle-man.

In 2018 we donated over $23,775 (8 percent of our profits) to different
causes. We raised money for the hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico
and the floods in Kerala. We helped fund the Presence-of-Blackness
project in speculative fiction, and a Mexicanx publication. Seeking the
non-binary

For years, my only metric of success was building a billion dollar
company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal. It's completely
arbitrary, and doesn't accurately reflect impact.

I'm not making an excuse or pretending that I didn't fail. I'm not
pretending that it feels good. Even though everyone knows that the
failure rate in startups, especially venture-funded ones, is super high,
it still sucks when you do.

I failed, but I also succeeded at many other things. We turned $10
million of investor capital into $178 million and counting for creators.
And without a fundraising goal coming up, we are just focused on
building the best product we can for them. On top of all that, I'm happy
creating value beyond our revenue-generating product, like these words
you're reading!

I can't wait until I'm successful so I can write about failure.

- Sahil Lavingia (@shl) October 1, 2013

I consider myself "successful" now. Not exactly in the way I intended,
though I think it counts. Where did my binary focus on building a
billion-dollar company come from in the first place?

I think I inherited it from a society that worships wealth. I don't
think it's a coincidence that Bill Gates was my all-time hero and was
also the world's richest person.

Since I can remember, I equated "successful" solely with net worth. If I
heard someone say "that person's really successful," I didn't assume
they were improving the well-being of the people around them, but that
they had found a way to make a lot of money.

Wealth can be a measure of success, as seems to be in the case of
someone like Bill Gates, who has invested heavily in philanthropy. But
it's not the only way to measure success, nor is it the best one.

There's nothing wrong with trying to build the next Microsoft. I
personally don't think billionaires are evil. And there's a part of me
that wishes I was still on that path.

But for better or worse, I'm on this one now. This has been my path to
notbuilding a billion-dollar company. There are many like it, but this
one is mine.

Let me know if you have any questions. I'm happy to help, or at least to
listen.

No funding winter at Inflection Point Ventures as it adds 100+ investors
every month

The Gurugram-based angel investment platform says its strong diligence
process and post-investment support for startups gives it an edge with
both retail investors and the companies it backs.

Jignesh Kenia, a chartered accountant who holds a key position at a
media company, has been an angel investor since 2018. He has invested
$250,000 so far in over 50 startups, and exited from seven with an
internal rate of return of more than 150%.

Jignesh has been investing through angel investment platform Inflection
Point Ventures (IPV), which has created an ecosystem to benefit both
entrepreneurs and investors.

Since its inception in 2018, Gurugram-based IPV has been driving the
narrative that startup investments are not a huge risk while providing
an opportunity to investors who come with relatively less amount of
capital.

Founded by professionals who had decades of experience in the financial
services world, IPV was quite clear on why and in whom it would like to
invest.

"Our core objective has been to democratise the world of angel
investment," says Ankur Mittal, Co-founder & COO, IPV.

The other co-founders of IPV are Vinay Bansal, Mitesh Shah, and Vinod
Bansal.

Today, the early-stage angel investment platform has an investor base of
over 7,200 people, and more than 60% of them belong to the CXO category
from around 45 countries.

The start

Ankur says the co-founders, including him, went about creating their own
channels to get into the funding mode.

The founders saw that a significant number of early-stage startup
investments were very personality-driven, i.e., based on decisions made
by a key individual who is well-connected within this ecosystem.

"This investment philosophy was driven by who is investing rather than
whom you are investing in," says Ankur.

IPV started creating its own network of investors, which mostly included
CXOs of companies. It also consisted of professionals who were experts
in their respective fields--be it finance, tech, HR, etc., which led to
startup deals coming onto the platform.

"We consciously built a CXO-driven platform, which ensured better deal
flows and deeper relationships within the ecosystem," says Ankur.

However, the core focus of IPV was there should be a return on
investment (RoI) as it had many investors who were partaking some amount
of money from their salaries to be part of this funding activity.

Focus on returns

To ensure better returns for its investors, IPV put in place an
exhaustive due diligence process for any startup investment, which was
backed by its CXO network, which had sectoral experts.

Ankur says IPV has built a proprietary scorecard, which looks into 30
variables and has over 400 plus questions. Based on the feedback of
startup founders, it gets inputs from its investors.

"We combine the art and science of investing though one cannot discount
the element of luck," remarks Ankur. He adds, "We are constantly
improving our selection process, which has reduced the failure rate of
startup investment."

Ankur claims that of the 132 investments made by IPV till now, only four
startups have failed to return the capital, and 55 of them have gotten
exits or follow-on funding.

No funding winter

Given the present environment of a funding slowdown, Ankur says IPV is
doing more investment deals than last year.

The platform is adding about 100 plus investors every month, with 80
percent of them coming through referrals.

"This environment works very well for us as people will invest in
opportunities that are well-researched," says Ankur.

This has had a bearing on the quantum of investment that IPV makes into
each startup. The average cheque size was around Rs 2.5 crore in 2021,
and this has increased to Rs 4 crore in 2022.

Today, any investor can come onto the platform with a minimum investment
of Rs 2.5 lakh. IPV has close to 7,200 investors on its platform at
present, and it has made 132 startup investments amounting to Rs 520
crore.

Angel investing platforms are something similar to crowdfunding but are
more structured where deals are sourced and presented to the investors,
who then decide whether to invest or not.

Ankur also cites the example of March 2020 when the first nationwide
lockdown was announced to combat COVID-19, and cheques dried up for
startups. It was during this time that IPV invested in startups such as
Otipy, Samosa Party, BluSmart, and Toch, which have all gone on to raise
their next round of funding.

"We were willing to write the cheques, but did not drop our due
diligence process," says Ankur.

Benefitting both investors and entrepreneurs

The investment philosophy of IPV has benefitted both investors and
startups. For the investors, they get an opportunity to invest in a good
asset class, and Ankur believes it has created a level playing field.

In the case of startups, besides the money raised through the platform,
it gets access to other important inputs like connections, market
linkages, strategic inputs, etc., all due to the CXOs available on IPV.

"We identify areas where the startup founders need help and our network
does the needful," says Ankur.

IPV is a stage and sector-agnostic platform for startup investment. It
typically comes in at a seed and pre-series A stage of funding.

The USP

In terms of competition, IPV runs into other angel investing platforms
like Indian Angel Network (IAN), Mumbai Angels, and Ah! Ventures, as
well as incubators and accelerators.

Ankur believes the strong diligence process and post-investment support
for startups give IPV an edge in the market. It has built strong
linkages with other VCs, family offices, and universities, which helps
support its startup portfolio.

According to an investor, the big differentiating factor for IPV is its
lower investment threshold, which is not the case with other platforms,
where an investor will have to invest anywhere above Rs 5 lakh.

In the present funding environment, Ankur is quite clear about the
startups IPV wants to invest in. Unless they can show an 18-month runway
in terms of capital availability, it will not invest.

He remarks that during the boom time of 2021, IPV had advised its
startups to raise as much capital as possible, because one never knows
when the situation would change.

The platform also launched a new VC fund called Physis Capital early
this year with a size of $50 million to invest in pre-Series A to Series
B startups.

Ankur says Physis Capital will allow it to invest in those startups in
the IPV portfolio, which are absolute winners.

"We have never believed in the FOMO (fear of missing out) style of
investing, and IPV has created an ecosystem where one earns the trust of
the investors," says Ankur.

How sports can serve as an efficient laboratory for us to learn about
life

Hindustan Times Lucknow

October 9, 2019 Wednesday

Copyright 2019 HT Digital streams Ltd All Rights Reserved

Length: 895 words

Dateline: India

Body

India, Oct. 9 -- Nearly every one of us has played a sport at some point
in our lives. Most of us enjoy watching sports. Events like the FIFA
World Cup or Wimbledon attract television and online viewership in
billions.

Hosting the Olympic games is seen as a matter of national pride, and can
impact the fortunes of an entire country or population. The business of
sports is a $500-billion industry worldwide, and growing. Clearly,
sports is a substantial aspect of the world we live in.

But what can we learn from sports? Remarkably, this is not a question
that schools or universities have directly asked or answered.

Universities, for example, have focused on developing excellence in
sports, and devote substantial resources to build winning teams and
nurture champion athletes. So much so that college football or
basketball in America is widely followed as a spectator sport. The
Oxford-Cambridge regatta has become an inherent and historic part of
elite higher education in the UK.

This in itself is a good thing. But there is a more substantial role
that sports must play in educational institutions.

I have invited Viswanathan Anand, one of the most accomplished chess
players in history, to share his views with me in this column.

Anand believes that sport imitates life, and shows you how a game needs
to be played correctly. In chess, for example, two players may be equal
in many spheres of the game, but on a given day, one person wins not
because of complete chess knowledge, but on that day their preparation,
intuition and guts worked in their favour.

Going beyond developing excellence in sports, universities must embrace
sports as a laboratory for life skills-where we can experiment and learn
about life.

This can be structured around several questions.

First, how do we learn to cope with and learn from failure? Losing is an
essential part of sports. No one likes to lose and, yet, we all do.

Playing sports regularly and, therefore, losing somewhat regularly gives
us an opportunity to develop a culture of learning from failure. Anand
believes that failures sometimes teach us more than success. When you
lose a game in chess, you can pinpoint the exact move that turned the
result.

That could be a calculation oversight, an emotional oversight or plain
physical fatigue. A good response to failure is not to brood, but to
introspect, identify areas of improvement, and work hard to get better.

We must similarly respond to failure in our jobs, startups or other
pursuits.

Second, how do we develop a culture of constant improvement? When Anand
sits down to prepare for a match, he focuses on the problems in his
preparation and just thinks of ways to solve them. Without worrying
about large, long-term goals or expectations, he just thinks about what
he should be working on for his next game. This cycle of constant review
and improvement must carry over into our professional lives.

Third, how does one learn to deal with pressure situations and perform
under pressure? Anand says that when you have had enough experience,
dealing with pressure becomes second nature. Sports can be great
training grounds to give us this experience. Anand believes that
pressure goes away the moment a game begins, because you only worry
about the position on the board and not about other things. Each of us
may deal with pressure differently, but we must learn to deal with the
stress situations we face in our lives. Sports offer a great testing
ground for this.

Fourth, how do you play fair and play by the rules all the time, without
exception?

When you knick an edge of your cricket bat to the wicket keeper, and the
umpire hasn't heard it, do you walk off the pitch back to the pavilion
or hold your ground? Anand believes that playing fair keeps his life
simple and keeps him out of real-life chess situations. How you handle
these situations in sports mirrors how you would handle them in life.

So how can modern universities leverage the potential of sports to help
students learn about life? The way to do this is to integrate sports
into the curriculum thoughtfully, and open faculty positions for
accomplished sportspersons who think cerebrally about how sports relate
to life. Students must be encouraged to reflect on their regular
sporting experience, whichever sport they choose to play, and determine
what life lessons they can draw.

In today's world, there are other interesting questions too which sports
can help us think about. How is a sport evolving, for example, and what
shape is it likely to take 20 years from now? Think of the advent of T20
cricket or chess robots.

Trends in sports tend to mirror broader trends in society, such as
shortening attention spans, and studying these can lead to interesting
insights.

As yet another example, we might think about what it means to be a good
team player in a virtual world, where online gaming participants team up
virtually with other players they have never met or otherwise interacted
with.

Sports mirror life, and therefore serve as a great laboratory to
experiment with, learn about and prepare for life in an unpredictable
world. Universities must embrace this view for the benefit of their
students.

Reflecting on my failure to build a billion-dollar company

Feb 12, 2019( TheNextWeb.com: http://thenextweb.com Delivered by
Newstex) ; This article was originally published on Medium[1] by Sahil
Lavingia[2], the Founder and CEO of Gumroad[3]. In 2011 I left my job as
the second employee at Pinterest-before I vested any of my stock-to work
on what I thought would be my life's work.Just had an idea for my first
billion-dollar company. Tomorrow, I start building it. — Sahil Lavingia
(@shl) April 2, 2011[4]Gumroad[5] would become a billion-dollar company,
with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I
died.

Something like that. That didn't happen. Now, it may look like I am in
an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, and low-maintenance
software business with customers who adore us. But for years, I
considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75
percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.
I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today. It
took me years to realize that I was misguided from the outset. This is
that journey, from the beginning.A weekend project turned VC-backed
startupThe idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be
able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick,
simple links. No need for a storefront. I built Gumroad that weekend,
and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News[6]. The reaction
exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on
the first day. Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at
Pinterest-before I vested any of my stock-to turn it into what I thought
would become my life's work. Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an
all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms[7], including
Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative
Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in
May 2012, we raised $7M more[8]. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins
Caufield ...ers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round. I was on top
of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank
and three employees. And the world was starting to take note. We grew
the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started
to climb. And then, at some point, they didn't. To keep the product
alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company-including many of my best
friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The
product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would
ever find out. Then TechCrunch published Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The
E-Commerce Startup Restructures[9]. All of a sudden my failure was
public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our
customers' concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their business
and wanted to know if they should look for an alternative after reading
the news; some of our favorite, most successful creators left. (It hurt,
but I don't blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own
businesses.) So what went wrong, and when?Failing in styleLet's start
with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume[10], up until the
layoffs: It doesn't look too bad, right? It's going in the right
direction: up. But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game
of double-or-nothing. It's euphoric when things are going your way-and
suffocating when they're not. And we weren't doubling fast enough to
raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we looked
for to grow the team. Every month of less than 20 percentgrowth should
have been a red flag. For the type of business we were trying to build,
every month of less than 20 percentgrowth should have been a red flag.
But at the time, I thought: 'It's okay.' We had money in the bank, we
had product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things
would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; it wasn't
our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner. But
now, I realize: It doesn't matter whose 'fault' it is, we hit a peak in
November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but
there weren't enough of them who needed our specific product offering.
Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to
justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until
acquisition or IPO). In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing
hail-mary[11], when our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway, I
told the twenty-person team: the road ahead was going to be a tough one.
We didn't have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to
work really hard over the next nine months to get even close to them. To
that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would
directly 'move the needle.' Many were not core to our business, but we
needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to
where it needed to be. If we succeeded, we would raise money from a
top-tier VC again, hire more people, and start the journey again. If we
didn't, we would have to drastically downsize the company. In those nine
months, when the whole team knew that we were fighting for our company's
life, not a single person left Gumroad. From 'this is gonna be hard,' to
'yep, turns out it was,' every single person worked harder than ever. We
launched a 'Small Product Lab' to teach new creators how to grow and
sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to
debit cards, payouts to the UK, Australia, and Canada, various additions
to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to
see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they've
purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just from August
to November. Unfortunately, we didn't hit the numbers we needed.Slim
down or shut down?Looking back, I'm glad we didn't hit those numbers. If
we doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again,
there was a very real possibility it would only lead to a more
spectacular failure. With that off the table, our options were:Shut down
the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something
new. Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for
sustainability. Position the company for an acquihire.Some of my
investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me
that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like
Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company
armed with all of my learnings-and their money. I tended to agree with
them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our
employees, and our investors-in that order. We helped thousands of
creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into
the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student
loans and kids' college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really
just turn that faucet off? And if I sold the company, it would be mostly
for our stellar team, which means I would no longer be able to control
the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories that
promised exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come-and ended with
a deprecated product[12] a year later. It was certainly tempting. I
could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all
again with a new idea. But that didn't sit right with me. We were
responsible to our creators first. That's what I told every new hire and
every investor. I didn't want to become a serial entrepreneur, and risk
disappointing another customer base. We decided to become profitable at
any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty
employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our
$25,000/month office and focused all of our remaining resources on
launching a premium service. In June 2015, a few months before our
layoffs, our financials looked like this:Revenue: $89,000 for the month
Gross profit: $17,000 Operating expenses: $364,000 Net profit:
-$351,000A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like
this:Revenue: $176,000 for the month Gross profit: $42,000 Operating
expenses: $32,000 Net profit: +$10,000It hurt, but it meant creators
would keep getting paid, and that we were in control of our own
destiny.Skeleton crew to lifestyle businessIt got worse from there.
Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our
investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other
opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one. I was
basically alone. I didn't have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco
was full of startups raising gobs more money, building amazing teams,
and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires.
Meanwhile, I had to run a 'measly' lifestyle business. It wasn't what I
wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking. Now, I understand
some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just
felt trapped. I couldn't stop, but there was only so much I could do as
an army of one. I shut off the rest of the world. I didn't tell my mom
about the layoffs-she had to read the article and tweets herself to find
out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed
nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time,
thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made
me more lonely. Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad's
support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to
ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed now,
but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken
care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a
side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed. To me, happiness is
so much about an expectation of positive change. Every year before 2016,
there was an improvement in my expectations-in the team, the product, or
the company-and this was the first time in my life when the present year
felt worse than the last. Living in San Francisco was already a
struggle, and when Trump won the election, I ended up leaving for
good[13].New beginningsThen one day, everything changed. Again. I'm wary
about sharing this part of the story, because I don't know if there is
anything to learn from it. But it happened, so here it is. On November
27, 2017 I got this email from KPCB, our lead investor: I am following
up our conversation a few months ago. KP would like to sell our
ownership back to Gumroad for $1. Can we discuss this week? Mike had
left KPCB to start a new company, and KPCB didn't want the operational
headache of appointing a new board member. Plus, it helped their taxes.
In one fell swoop, our liquidation preferences (how much we would have
to sell for before dollars started going to employees) went from about
$16.5M to $2.5M. All of a sudden, there was a light at the end of the
tunnel. Small, dim, and far away, but present. There was a path to an
independent business, not beholden to the go-big-or-go-home mentality I
signed up for when I raised money. One investor joined them. We've
bought back a couple more, since then. I keep the rest of the investors
up-to-date with a brief email every few months. The future came into
focus: I could grow a small team, slowly buy back our investors, and
build Gumroad into a meaningful business focused on our creators. We
would never become a billion-dollar company, and that started to feel
okay. Certainly, the thousands of creators selling on Gumroad wouldn't
mind.Finding new forms of impactThe eight years I worked on Gumroad were
full of personal ups and downs. There were months where I worked 16
hours a day. But there were also some months where I worked four hours a
week. Here's one way to picture[14] that time: Can you tell which is
which? I can't. We had a sales team for a few years, then we didn't. Can
you tell when we made the switch? I can't. It doesn't matter how amazing
your product is, or how fast you ship features. The market you're in
will determine most of your growth. For better or worse, Gumroad grew at
roughly the same rate almost every month because that's how quickly the
market determined we would grow. So instead of pretending to be some
sort of product visionary, trying to build a billion-dollar company, I'm
just focused on making Gumroad better and better for our existing
creators. Because they are the ones that have kept us alive.Creating and
capturing valueAt a CEO Summit many years ago, my all-time hero, Bill
Gates, was on stage. Someone asked him how he dealt with failing to
capture so much value? Microsoft was huge, sure, but tiny compared to
the total impact it has had on the world and on humanity. Bill's answer:
sure, but that's true with all companies, right? They create some value
and succeed in capturing a very small percentage of it. Similarly, I am
now more focused on creating value than capturing it. I still want to
have as large an impact as possible, but I don't need to create it
directly, or capture it in the form of our revenue or our valuation. For
example, Austen Allred, who's raised $48M for his startup Lambda School,
got his start selling a book on Gumroad.I shifted my focus from selling
my book (using Gumroad, the platform he built) to growing a VC-backed
company (which he invested in). We still disagree on some things I'm
sure, but everyone could learn a lot and quickly by getting out of his
or her bubble. — Austen Allred (@Austen) February 7, 2018[15] Startups
have been founded by former Gumroad employees, and dozens more companies
have been massively improved by recruiting our alumni. On top of that,
our product ideas, like our credit card form and inline-checkout
experience, have proliferated the web, making it a better place for
everyone-including those that have never used Gumroad. While Gumroad,
Inc may be small, our impact is large. There is, of course, the
$178,000,000 we have sent to creators. But then there's the impact of
the impact, the opportunities that those creators have taken to create
new opportunities for others.Opening upI've found other ways to create
value, too. After the layoffs, I didn't talk to anyone about Gumroad.
Not even my mom. And after moving away from San Francisco, I felt pretty
disconnected from the startup community. So, as a way to re-engage with
the community, I thought about sharing our financials publicly. Founders
starting their own companies could learn from our mistakes, utilizing
our data to make better decisions. It was scary: What if we don't grow
every month? It could scare off prospective customers. It's something I
would never expect a startup seeking venture capital to do. It makes
sense to hold those cards as close to your chest for as long as possible
when you must raise money, hire people, and compete for customers with
other venture-seeking startups. But, since we were not any of those
things anymore, it was easier to share that information. We were
profitable, and a no-growth month won't change that. So in April 2018, I
started to release our monthly financials publicly.Gumroad in April:
GMV: $4.2M (down 2 percent) Revenue: $273K (down 2 percent) Gross
profit: $65K (up 34 percent) Let me know if you have any questions! —
Sahil Lavingia (@shl) May 14, 2018[16] Ironically, more investors have
reached out (we're just interested in raising money from our customers
for the moment, thanks!), more folks want to contribute to Gumroad, and
our shift in focus has brought us closer to our creators. Instead of
freaking out about how 'small' Gumroad actually is (like I thought they
would), our creators have grown more loyal. It feels like we're all in
this together, trying to do earn a living doing what we love. Soon, we
will also open-source the whole product, WordPress-style. Anyone will be
able to deploy their own version of Gumroad, make the changes they want,
and sell the content they want, without us being the middle-man. In 2018
we donated over $23,775 (8percent of our profits) to different causes.
We raised money for the hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico and the
floods in Kerala. We helped fund the Presence-of-Blackness project in
speculative fiction[17], and a Mexicanx publication[18].Seeking the
non-binaryFor years, my only metric of success was building a billion
dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal. It's completely
arbitrary, and doesn't accurately reflect impact. I'm not making an
excuse or pretending that I didn't fail. I'm not pretending that it
feels good. Even though everyone knows that the failure rate in
startups, especially venture-funded ones, is super high, it still sucks
when you do. I failed, but I also succeeded at many other things. We
turned $10 million of investor capital into $178 million and counting
for creators. And without a fundraising goal coming up, we are just
focused on building the best product we can for them. On top of all
that, I'm happy creating value beyond our revenue-generating product,
like these words you're reading!I can't wait until I'm successful so I
can write about failure. — Sahil Lavingia (@shl) October 1, 2013[19] I
consider myself 'successful' now. Not exactly in the way I intended,
though I think it counts. Where did my binary focus on building a
billion-dollar company come from in the first place? I think I inherited
it from a society that worships wealth. I don't think it's a coincidence
that Bill Gates was my all-time hero and was also the world's richest
person. Since I can remember, I equated 'successful' solely with net
worth. If I heard someone say 'that person's really successful,' I
didn't assume they were improving the well-being of the people around
them, but that they had found a way to make a lot of money. Wealth can
be a measure of success, as seems to be in the case of someone like Bill
Gates, who has invested heavily in philanthropy. But it's not the only
way to measure success, nor is it the best one. There's nothing wrong
with trying to build the next Microsoft. I personally don't think
billionaires are evil. And there's a part of me that wishes I was still
on that path. But for better or worse, I'm on this one now. This has
been my path to notbuilding a billion-dollar company. There are many
like it, but this one is mine. Let me know[20] if you have any
questions. I'm happy to help, or at least to listen. Gumroad is a

Ahead of Shahid Kapoor's Jersey, revisiting Nani's reaffirming movie

Indian Express

April 21, 2022 Thursday

Length: 768 words

A look at Nani starrer Jersey before watching Shahid Kapoor's Hindi
remake of the same film.

Most films are defined by their genre, but a very few are so complete
that it's difficult to put them in a box. Telugu film Jersey is one such
movie. It's a movie you'd watch with your whole family, and everyone
would relate to it in someway or another. If you are passionate towards
something or you feel you're not able to match up with the expectations
of your family or are unable to keep them happy, you'd see yourself in
Nani's character Arjun.

The film, which released in 2019, went on to grab multiple National
Awards. It became such a big phenomenon that it was remade in Hindi with
Shahid Kapoor playing the lead role. But before we watch the Hindi
version, here's understanding why Nani's film felt so special.

Jersey is a story of passion, self-respect, failure, refusing to give up
and having the gumption to start all over again when it seems the game
is already over. It's a tale that addresses love for one's family, and
how you'd go to any length to prove yourself worthy of their love. It's
emotional, dramatic, keeps you at the edge, makes you sob but also
leaves you hopeful and inspired. It's a 2.5-hour journey of going
through a gamut of emotions, ending with perhaps the most noble of them
all - redemption. In the times when making pan Indian film has become a
fashion, this Telugu film makes a place in your heart. It's a wholesome
story of a very middle-class simple family, which makes it relatable to
everyone irrespective of the language.

In an interview earlier, Nani said that while he "cannot let go of his
version" of the film, he's excited about the remake and is looking
forward to witness it as an audience.

"The story is being retold by the same director, Gowtam Tinnanuri. There
is so much heart in Jersey because of Gowtam, his vision and the way he
wrote his script. When the original director is handling it [the
remake], I know the Hindi version will receive the same love. Jersey is
my film - it is a beautiful story and is close to my heart. No matter
when I am watching Jersey, along with the story, I will also be seeing
if I delivered it right. So, there will be a sense of detachment to the
story where I look at myself and say, 'hey you didn't do it right'. I
wanted to experience the story like an audience," Nani told
IndiaToday.in. He also praised Shahid and called him a "brilliant
performer," who can "get into the skin of the character."

Jersey revolves around middle-aged Arjun, who is at the cusp of
greatness when life takes a different turn for him. He's a caring father
who shares his passion for cricket with his son, but is nothing more
than a huge disappointment for his wife (who initially is introduced as
his greatest support). It's only when he is unable to buy a Rs 500 worth
Indian cricket team jersey that Arjun feels humiliated and disgusted
because of several episodes. And his reason to keep his head held high
for everyone, including his son, inspires him to return to the cricket
field.

Be it the scene where Nani slaps his kid or gets slapped by his wife,
where he expresses his frustration by yelling, and the scene where
Arjun's son tells him he wants to see him on the cricket field - they
are the moments when he shines like a hero.

Because of his work over the years, Nani is fondly called Natural Star
by his fans, and he justifies the tag here.In an interview with
indianexpress.com, Gowtam Tiinnanuri spoke about his and Nani's
favourite scene, shot at the railway station. "I had goosebumps when I
experienced people's reaction to this scene. Normally, we tend to scream
in extreme anger and we laugh when we are extremely happy. But
sometimes, we cry because we are happy and that is the one contrasting
emotion we wanted to shoot. In the scene, Arjun is in a position where
he cannot express his achievement to others and has no one to share his
happiness with. He has to express and share it with himself only.

Before shooting the scene, I briefed Nani about how we wanted the scene
to look like. After the briefing, I wanted him to do a mock shoot as we
did not have much time. But Nani was ready and confident enough to do it
without any rehearsals. As soon as the train came in and Nani performed
the scene, all of us on the set reacted just the way the audience
reacted in the theater. Even Nani got a bit teary-eyed after the scene."

Jersey celebrated three years of its release on April 19 of this year.
While the Telugu film is currently streaming on ZEE5, the Hindi version
of the film, starring Shahid Kapoor, releases this Friday.

Alibaba buys Bangladesh food delivery service HungryNaki

Dhaka, March 4 - Alibaba Group Holding has reached a deal that is to be
announced Thursday under which it will buy a leading Bangladeshi online
meal delivery service in one of its first international forays in the
fast-growing sector.

Alibaba took full control of Ele.me, China's second-largest food
delivery service, in 2018.

The platform, which has expanded to encompass services including
manicures and housecleaning, generated 24.29 billion yuan ($3.75
billion) in revenue for Alibaba in the nine months to Dec. 31. Ele.me
and other Alibaba "local services" units counted 290 million customers
and 850,000 drivers, according to a company presentation last September.

HungryNaki, Alibaba's new Bangladeshi affiliate, is much smaller.
Founded in 2013, it claims to have more than 500,000 regular customers
ordering from 4,000 restaurants in five cities. The company has 500
drivers and 100 staff.

"This is the first acquisition of a Bangladeshi startup," Chief
Executive A.D. Ahmad told Nikkei Asia. "It is a matter of pride. We have
concluded the deal and it may take a month to finalize the acquisition
process."

Alibaba is acquiring 100% of the company from its local owners via Daraz
Group, the Pakistan-based e-commerce platform it acquired in 2018. Daraz
plans to extend HungryNaki's network to around 100 cities, with
investments in infrastructure, technology and human resources, officials
said. No price has been disclosed.

"We believe instead of building our own food delivery business from the
ground up, acquiring HungryNaki is ideal," Daraz spokesperson Shayantani
Twisha told Nikkei.

Daraz has been Alibaba's main operating vehicle in Bangladesh, Pakistan,
Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Alibaba has invested more heavily in
India, but over the past year has seen some of its apps banned and
further investments restrained due to the border conflict between China
and India.

Ant Group, Alibaba's financial services subsidiary, bought a 20% stake
in bKash, a Bangladeshi peer, in 2018. Ant has also invested in Indian
food delivery app Zomato.

Bangladesh's food delivery market has attracted international interest
before. Berlin-based Foodpanda launched in the country soon after
HungryNaki. More recently, Singapore-based Golden Gate Ventures led a
$15 million round for rival delivery service Shohoz.

With as many as nine delivery apps competing over around 100,000 orders
a day, many of the services have been bleeding cash. Uber Eats closed
its local operations last year.

A HungryNaki investor told Nikkei he would be taking a large loss on the
capital he had put into the company with the sale to Alibaba.

"This is not a success case for local entrepreneurs, rather a failure
case for startups," he said.

Maliha Quadir, founder and managing director of Shohoz, told Nikkei she
remains bullish about food delivery's prospects in the country, given
rising incomes and employment rates for women, but worries about the
entry of foreign operators.

"Big players will make it difficult for local startups," she said.
"Bangladesh's market is small."

Others, though, see Alibaba's move as a vote of confidence in the
country's private sector.

"This will be a positive move," said Muhammad Abdul Wahed Tomal, general
secretary of the e-Commerce Association of Bangladesh. "HungryNaki will
get bigger."

Redesign Health scores $65M to create and launch more healthcare
startups

Indian Health care news

September 19 -- Redesign Health has built and launched 40 healthcare
startups since 2018, and it nabbed $65 million in fresh funding to
jump-start dozens more.

 

 

General Catalyst led the series C financing round. CVS Health Ventures,
UPMC Enterprises, the innovation and venture capital arm of leading
health system UPMC, Eden Global Partners, Euclidean Capital, Samsung
Next, TriplePoint Capital and founding investor Declaration Partners
also participated in the financing.

The round brings the company's post-money valuation to $1.7 billion,
according to a source with knowledge of the funding, Fast Company
reported.

Based in New York City, Redesign Health is a healthcare startup creator
that builds tech-enabled healthcare businesses. Redesign has helped
launch companies touching the lives of more than 10 million people
across verticals including cancer care, teleaudiology, senior care,
COVID-19 testing and metabolic health.

Companies Redesign has helped launch include Jasper Health, which helps
cancer patients manage treatment, Dan Trigub's MedArrive, men's health
startup Vault Health and metabolic health company Calibrate, among other
ventures.

Redesign Health executives say the company's model is unique, and it
sets itself apart from venture capital firms, incubators
and accelerators.

 "We're very focused and believe in enabling a new innovation model in
healthcare," said Samantha Lynch, Redesign Health's head of strategy and
finance. "We want to continue working with industry leaders like CVS and
UPMC to transform the industry from within by investing in the platform
from a team and technologist standpoint."

The $65 million boost will be leveraged to build out Redesign's team and
technology, Lynch noted.

Redesign works with startups to bring a new model of innovation to
healthcare, she said. The legacy systems, processes and incentive
structures in U.S. healthcare can be dramatically improved but require a
groundswell of technology adoption and business model innovation.

Following months of cross-functional ideation and research, Redesign
Health assembles founding teams to address specific healthcare
challenges. The company then arms startup teams with tools and
technologies spanning more than 20 functional areas including product,
design, engineering, user research, marketing, sales and compliance to
craft go-to-market strategies, build user-centric digital products,
prove product/market fit and scale, according to the company.

"Healthcare is a particularly challenging state to launch a business out
in the wild given the regulatory complexity, the conservative nature of
the ecosystem, the opaque value chains and the fact that it's super
relationship-based," Lynch said. "We can use the platform, the
technology, the tools, the insights at Redesign to lower barriers to
change across the industry."

About 90% of startups fail, and many do for the same common reasons,
such as lack of market or product fit, marketing and team problems.

 "What our model does is really to decrease those type of risks and
bring in corporate partners to bring impactful healthcare solutions to
market," Lynch said. "Some of the things may be the wrong idea, the
wrong team. If you're a healthcare seed stage company out in the wild,
it's hard to get a pilot with a major enterprise because, for large
incumbents, they can't take the same approach as startups, the 'break
things, learn and iterate.' That doesn't work in people's health."

"Redesign can help build teams that represent healthcare, technology and
business and then navigate the value chains to get into the right
payers, providers, hospital systems, all those areas that are potential
failure points for startups," she said. "We learned from our first
companies, documented those pain points and then began to evolve our
process and capabilities and our network of incumbent partners to help
address those so that we could decrease risk and accelerate growth."

Alongside their investments, General Catalyst, CVS Health Ventures and
UPMC Enterprises will leverage Redesign's platform tools, technologies
and insights to help build and support dozens of businesses addressing
unmet needs in the next few years.

"The past few years have put a spotlight on where the U.S. healthcare
system falls short," Hemant Taneja, CEO and managing director of General
Catalyst, said in a statement.

"We share a belief with Redesign Health that we're at a moment of
critical need and opportunity for industry transformation. They've made
remarkable progress over a short period of time, and we're excited to
work closely with them to help healthcare institutions on their digital
transformation journey with our principles of responsible innovation."

"Leaders like CVS and UPMC tap into the platform and the learnings we've
gathered from launching 40 companies to date. We believe this new
innovation model that we're trying to build can combine the vast
expertise and distribution capital that large companies like them have
with the startup DNA of entrepreneurs," Lynch said.

She added, "If you look at the path from writing down an idea on a
napkin to bringing a company to market, there's hundreds of different
jobs to be done. A large number of those can leverage repeatable
components and tools, and so we're aggregating our knowledge across the
ecosystem and to build technical solutions to enable better, faster and
more efficient execution."

Busting success myths: founders of Zomato, Freshworks, MakeMyTrip, and
others reveal how they almost blew it

Dentsu Webchutney CEO Sidharth Rao's new book, 'How I Almost Blew It,
incredible lessons from India's most successful digital entrepreneurs',
tells the stories of some of India's earliest internet entrepreneurs and
their near-fiascos, which make for great lessons.

Every year-end, it is common to find in the media a list of startups
that have pulled down their shutters. And though these shutdowns
indicate the health of the startup ecosystem since "failure is a
byproduct of entrepreneurship," for founders, often enough, it is a test
of their endurance.

In his recently published book, 'How I Almost Blew It, incredible
lessons from India's most successful digital entrepreneurs', Sidharth
Rao, Founder & CEO of Dentsu Webchutney, tells the stories of some of
India's earliest internet entrepreneurs and their near-fiascos, which
make for great lessons for today's young founders struggling to find a
foothold.

"In India, there isn't much literature available in the entrepreneurship
space which tells you the stories beyond the vanity milestones that most
media focus on reporting. I knew most of these entrepreneurs as friends,
agency partners, mentors, and in some cases, a mix of all. It was easy
for me to have freewheeling chats with them, and that is why the
material you read in the book is honest," says Sidharth in an
interaction with YourStory.

Busting myths

Sidharth, who has been a witness to the rise and fall of the internet
economy three times in the last two decades, is himself a digital
entrepreneur. At the age of 19, he co-founded Webchutney, that was
acquired by Japanese advertising giant Dentsu in 2013. Today, besides
being the CEO at Dentsu Webchutney, Sidharth is also an angel investor
in a few startups like InVideo, CoHo, and ScoopWhoop.

"As the internet celebrates 25 years of being publicly available next
year, there's never been a better time to be an entrepreneur. With more
opportunities, a large amount of capital, an unprecedented scale of
internet users, lower costs and a more level playing field than ever
before, the Indian digital ecosystem is exploding. Fortunately, I have
had the privilege of a ringside view of the industry from the
beginning," he writes in the book.

In these two decades, the internet economy bubble has gone bust thrice.
The first one was in 1994, then in 2008 following the Lehman Brothers'
bankruptcy episode, and then in 2016, when the impact was felt on Indian
startups as well.

Sidharth says, "It occurred right after giants like Tiger Global,
Naspers, and DST Global fuelled an investment frenzy in the ecosystem.
Every venture capitalist rushed in trying to match their investments..."

Sidharth was 35 around that time and was on his way to raise a large sum
for a proposed incubator. But he was told by potential investors that he
was "too old" to do this all over again.

"It seemed that if one wasn't an IIT graduate or a dropout and younger
than 23, there was a slim chance of attracting investors."

Tough times, tougher founders

If like us, you are one of those who has been following the Indian
startup ecosystem, you may recall the funding frenzy through much of
2014 and 2015. From the entitled founders of Housing.com to the Silicon
Valley-returned ones of Snapdeal, and the young brigade of Ola and Oyo,
it was indeed the 'season of receiving' from Santa VCs. Until, of
course, when the "music suddenly stopped" as Sidharth puts it.

Through these ups and downs, there were a few successful entrepreneurs
"who have acquired a lot of experience in navigating through tough
times, scaling, almost blowing it up, fundraising and ultimately
succeeding. They have lived lives that aspiring entrepreneurs can learn
from," writes Sidharth.

Writing about their mistakes and success, Sidharth says he found it
fascinating that regardless of the scale and size of operations and
outcomes, all entrepreneurs go through almost the similar predicaments
in their journey.

The book captures the stories of some of India's biggest internet
entrepreneurs like Sanjeev Bikhchandani (InfoEdge), Deep Kalra
(MakeMyTrip), Deepinder Goyal (Zomato), Sahil Barua (Delhivery), Ashish
Hemrajani (BookMyShow), Girish Mathrubootham (Freshworks), and more.

"Startups can die of indigestion, not just starvation. Ashish of
BookMyShow and Sanjeev from InfoEdge keep emphasising in the book,
especially when asked to reflect on the hyper-funding environment that
prevailed in 2015 that dried up quicker than it built up," Sidharth
tells YourStory, adding, "At the peak of the bubble, everyone starts
thinking that money is going to solve all the problems and that's just
not the case. As an entrepreneur, your job is to do what is right for
the end-user. Money and valuation is a by-product of that endeavour."

Sify rise and fall

Sidharth, who knew most entrepreneurs before he started on his book,
says it is difficult to pick his favourite story, but admits that there
were a few stories he did not know beforehand.

Ramaraj's story of building Sify was one such. "How he built India's
first private ISP ground up in the late 90s and then went on to become
the second company to list on Nasdaq after Infosys, achieving a market
capitalisation of nearly $12 billion, and then see it all come crashing
down. It was surreal hearing his adventurous ride," he says.

Sahil Barua's journey of Delhivery is another story that Sidharth finds
fascinating. "It made me think that his was arguably one of the toughest
businesses to be built in recent times. Ashish Hemrajani is always
entertaining to hear; I could go and on about each one of them"

Sify was India's first private internet service provider (ISP) and was
also the first internet startup from India that became a decacorn
(companies valued over $10 billion when listed). Sidharth writes: "Sify
is known for making the most audacious acquisition that cost it nearly
Rs 500 crore." It had acquired a small company, IndiaWorld, whose
turnover was just Rs 3 crore, and this acquisition officially flagged
off the dot-com mania in India.

However, within 18 months, Sify crashed after being devalued at $70
million. It lost over $11 billion of market capitalisation in less than
two years. "If these numbers are any indication, Ramaraj's ride with
Sify is certainly not for the faint-hearted," he writes.

Lessons in success

As an entrepreneur himself, Sidharth took away many lessons from the
journeys of these great founders. The most important one, he says, is
that it takes decades to become an overnight success. Some of India's
biggest success stories like MakeMyTrip, InfoEdge, Matrimony.com,
BookMyShow, Indiamart etc. have been around for 20 years.

He also believes that the first mover advantage is a myth. "It's said
'pioneers often get arrows in their backs,' and it holds for startups as
well. There were plenty of attempts in every vertical you can imagine
much before the settlers came in and grabbed the land. Also, most
startups in this new age live in dog years," he adds.

As a co-founder himself, Sidharth says he realised how important it is
to be open with one's co-founder and sort out differences sooner than
later. He says,

"Toxic co-founder relationship is one of the top three reasons for
failures of startups. You can't sidestep the hard work that it takes to
make a relationship work. And that is a continuous process of embracing
conflict and resolving it."

And when everything is said and done, the role that being at the right
place at the right time plays, is the difference between success and
failure. "It plays out more often than it is admitted, but total dumb
luck is a massive X-factor whether a company makes it to the finish
line. Sadly, many founders tend to gloss over this fact when talking
about how they have 'made it'," adds Sidharth.

The rise and growth of the Indian startup ecosystem has birthed
thousands of stories, Sidharth points out that there is so much more
that needs to be documented, discussed, and debated about the startup
ecosystem in India. "I wish more people who have been inside the ring
find time to do it. We owe it to the community," he says

Rethink and reshape

The News International

August 30, 2020 Sunday

Section: Vol. 30; No. 152

Length: 1443 words

PPrime Minister Imran Khan and his party now have the benefit of
hindsight gained from two whole years in power. With this benefit, they
should ensure that in their third year in government - as well as in the
two years subsequent to that - they add to what they have already
achieved, do not repeat their mistakes and embark upon some
path-breaking initiatives which not only help win them the next election
but also address some seemingly intractable problems.

One of the key areas where the government needs to rethink its policies
and reshape its strategies is implementation. This government has so
many ideas that all look good - at least on paper - but many of them
have not been implemented effectively so far. Consider the prime
minister's incentive package for the construction sector and its
accompanying idea of providing low cost housing at a mass scale. Or take
the case of reforming the civil service. Or the revival of loss-making
public-sector enterprises. None of these has even taken off the ground
successfully.

This may prompt the government's political opponents to argue that the
failure to make any tangible progress on any of these ideas shows that
the ruling party is less serious in putting its ideas into actions. It
is, however, electorally suicidal for a political party interested in
retaining power beyond its first constitutional tenure to ignore its own
flagship ideas or initiatives. So, arguably, it is not for lack of
seriousness that the government is failing to provide a befitting
momentum to the plans mentioned above. What is it then?

To know the answer, it is important for Prime Minister Imran Khan to
analyze whether these initiatives are too ambitious to achieve within a
government's constitutional tenure, or if they require financial
resources that the state cannot procure, and how and wherefrom the
government can find the right kind of human resources to achieve its
objectives - provided it can find them at all.

He should then revisit, review and revise his flagship ideas and
initiatives in the light of the answers he gets. This process must
include three core components.

The first is a review of policy formulation process and its ingredients.
If carried out objectively, this review should apprise Prime Minister
Imran Khan if ground realities were really taken into consideration
while formulating policies for the implementation of his pet projects.
It should also tell him if his aides thoroughly understood the
intricacies of the political economy of policy implementation. And,
finally, it should inform him if his team identified the potential risks
and their possible mitigation measures.

The second component is an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of
implementation agencies. This exercise should involve an analysis of
their structures, the financial resources available to them and the
human resources at their command. If done dispassionately, this should
identify gaps in the capacity of implementation agencies.

The third component involves a gauging of governance processes that
affect implementation. By governance, I do not mean planning and
decision-making. I am, instead, using the notion of governance in a
broader sense that includes the way decisions are made vis-a-vis policy
formulation and implementation, the capability of the personnel involved
in decision-making processes and the relative powers and
responsibilities within that personnel, the evidence used in planning
and decision-making processes and the mechanism of conflict resolution
within decision-makers.

When triangulated, these three reviews should highlight why some of the
government's most important initiatives have not been implemented and
what needs to be done to put them back on track again.

Let me explain how this review process should work by focusing on the
incentive package for the construction sector and its complementary
scheme to build low-cost housing units. In theory, both of these have
the potential to kick-start economic activity (read: livelihood
security) and resolve the housing problems of the low and middle income
sections of society. But one major hurdle standing in the way of the
construction sector is that different urban development authorities
operating in different parts of the country do not follow a standardized
set of rules and regulations.

The greatest obstacle hampering low-cost housing is the availability of
bank loans to people. While the government has introduced a number of
changes in the way banks assess the prospective house owners and the
methodology for the disbursement of loans, the real problem is the need
to provide collateral to be eligible for a bank loan.

A tridimensional review of both these initiatives should highlight the
lacunae they suffer from. Among many other things, these lacunae consist
of gaps and flaws at the policy formulation stage which, for instance,
disallowed policymakers from taking into consideration the different
rules and regulations concerning the construction sector in different
parts of Pakistan. The lacunae also pertain to the lack of executive
authority over such institutions as banks which play a crucial rule in
both the construction and housing sectors, and the non-existing
financial and human capabilities within implementing agencies.

Most importantly, they include the inefficiencies and imperfections
brought in by different interest groups who spend time, energy and
resources to protect their legitimate and illegitimate interests. The
government must understand the importance of avoiding a constant tug of
war among different interest groups which is the surest way to ensure
any policy's failure.

To sum it up, the government can start at the very beginning and embark
on course correction by putting its own house in order. Without
improving the financial and human resources available at government
institutions, none of the lacunae mentioned above can be plugged.

But reforming a sluggish, overstaffed and underperforming civil service
is much easier said than done. Over the last two decades, there have
been two major attempts at reforming the civil service: one under Gen
Pervez Musharraf in which lateral entries of technocrats, market
competitive salaries and monetization of such benefits as transport and
housing were introduced but all that created more problems than it
resolved; the second attempt was the 18th Amendment that transferred a
huge amount of federal government functions to the provincial
governments but even then the size of the federal bureaucracy has
expanded since this amendment.

What may give the government some hope in this regard is the fact that
it is not alone in the failure to reform the civil service. This, in
fact, has become almost a universal problem. In more than 25 countries,
governments have established special delivery vehicles called central
delivery units (CDU) or prime minister's delivery units (PMDUs). The
most successful among them have clearly defined remits, complete support
of the executive authority, a concomitant mechanism for accountability
and a lean agenda so that they do not become parking lots for every
failing government policy.

In Pakistan's case, public-sector companies formed by Punjab's former
chief minister Shahbaz Sharif were also aimed at insulating his pet
initiative from bureaucratic inertia and inter-departmental conflicts.
But he created too many delivery vehicles for too many initiatives which
diluted the support of his own office for each of them.

His decision to allow serving bureaucrats to work in these companies on
huge salaries created a new set of interest groups which developed their
own political economy besides increasing the financial burden on the
exchequer. However, Sharif was still able to complete some of his
flagship road-building and power generation projects in record time.

While the government can definitely learn something valuable from these
experiments, my suggestion is that it should establish a PMDU within the
Prime Minister's Office. The prime minister himself should select a
maximum of three ideas/initiatives that this unit should bring to
fruition in the next three years.

One of these ideas/initiatives could be to change at least one ministry
or department and turn it into a model institution by completely
reforming its structure and improving its financial and human
capacities. This could then become a precursor for the broader civil
service reforms which require a much longer time than this government
can spare and a much bigger effort than the prime minister and his party
can manage given that there is a lot that they need to fix in many other
parts of the polity.

Chennai, Jan. 30 -- In an endeavour towards linking academia to market
place and create a process so that more and more faculty and students
are willing to go through the entrepreneurship route, the first
Deshpande-Gopalakrishnan Symposium on Innovation and Entrepreneurship
was held at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) between
28th and 30th January 2018.

This symposium was organized by the Gopalakrishnan Deshpande Centre
(GDC) for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at IIT Madras, with the
support of IIT Bombay and the Deshpande Foundation.

Addressing the inaugural function held on Sunday, Dr. Gururaj "Desh"
Deshpande, Chairman of the Deshpande Foundation, co-sponsor of GDC and
an IIT Madras Alumnus, said, "As a country, India spends over Rs. One
Trillion per year on Research and Development. It is critical for the
innovation ecosystem in India to be able to translate a good part of
this R&D spend into scalable products and services that positively
impact society. One of the principal objectives of GDC would be to
develop and implement initiatives working with leading technology
institutions nationwide that transforms and scales research from the
academic labs into successful businesses that positively impact
society."

Established in 2017, the core objective of GDC is to foster innovation
in academic campuses and bring about a transformation by which
scientific and technological ideas can move from an institute's
laboratories to the marketplace by way of sustainable business ventures.

The Symposium attracted like-minded practitioners, administrators, and
academicians focused on promoting innovation and entrepreneurship across
the academic environment besides early stage entrepreneurs and students
looking to start their own ventures.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. "Kris" Gopalakrishnan, Co-sponsor of GDC
and former CEO of Infosys who is also an IIT Madras Alumnus, said "GDC
will also support special projects that can potentially create a
transformative and positive impact on society. Such projects can be at
the ideation stage or they could be running ventures that need some
business reconfiguration to grow to full potential."

The three-day symposium featured four keynote talks and five topical
Panel discussions in an interactive forum, which were participated by
eminent personalities from the academic and the industry including Mr.
Gopichand Katragadda, Group CTO, TATA Sons Ltd, Mr. K. Subramanian,
Executive Director - R&D, Powergear Ltd, Mr. S. Krishnan, IAS, Principal
Secretary to Government, Housing and Urban Development Department,
Government of Tamil Nadu, among others.

The topics for the panel discussion were:

1. Building an entrepreneurial ecosystem - Challenges and solutions

2. Entrepreneurial Curriculum models

3. PPP to drive innovation and entrepreneurship

4. Funding Innovation across the spectrum - what do funders expect?

5. Innovation in Research methods - How to cultivate I&E thinking and
Creativity in research scholars and Faculty?

Speaking about the GDC, Prof. Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Director, IIT Madras,
said, "GDC is designed to fill in specific gaps in the innovation system
of IIT Madras, in the specific areas of pre-incubation and nurturing
initiatives that have a very high positive impact on society." Prof. R.
Nagarajan, Dean (Alumni and International Relations), IIT Madras, said,
"The innovation and entrepreneurship at IIT Madras is one of the best in
the country, and it is being significantly strengthened by the support
of alumni, willing to give freely of their time, talent & treasure."

At the beginning of the Symposium, an MOU was signed between IIT Madras
and the University of New Brunswick (UNB), Canada. The MoU between UNB
and IIT Madras covers exchange of students of faculty for research
collaboration & education purposes. Post-doctoral Fellows are also
included in the scope, and will be prioritized.

Throwing some light on the future course of action for GDC, Prof
Krishnan Balasubramanian, Dean (ICSR), IIT Madras and
Professor-in-Charge, GDC, said "Our first set of programmes will be
launched in March 2018. This will be a pilot programme of about 5-6
teams, each comprising of a faculty member, entrepreneur and a mentor,
who will interact with about 100 customers each to validate their
customer value propositions and business models." This exercise will aid
in reducing the startup failure rate.

United States : Groups Sue EPA for Stronger Clean Air Protections

TendersInfo

NRDC (the Natural Resources Defense Council), together with Sierra Club
and the Environmental Integrity Project, sued the Environmental
Protection Agency today to force it to fulfill its Clean Air Act
obligations and require states to close polluter loopholes in state
plans under the Act. Decades-old gaps in the law allow industry to evade
responsibility for preventable harms that disproportionately affect
communities of color and low income communities, and the agency has
failed to act to close these loopholes.

The EPA has the power to close these loopholes and hold industry
accountable and reduce hazards to protect communities like the one I
grew up in, said Yudith Nieto, Board Member, Coming Clean.

In the wake of Hurricane Ida, Gulf Coast petrochemical facilities and
petroleum refineries are yet again spewing pollution, unchecked, through
leaks, spills and flaring. Incessant releases like these, of huge
amounts of noxious gases, take place at many industrial facilities all
over the country during startups, shutdowns and malfunctions, sometimes
even surpassing facilities annual pollution limits.

These companies are not held accountable and they are permitted to
poison our neighbors during their most vulnerable moments, Nieto said.

Yet, existing Clean Air Act loopholes in many state plans allow industry
to exceed their pollution limits with impunity and provide no checks on
frequency, time or volume for these exceedances. For communities near
these facilities, the cumulative impacts can be serious, increasing the
risk of various cancers, respiratory ailments and other serious health
problems.

Fenceline communities are the first people to be impacted before, during
and after SSM events, Nieto added. When natural disasters strike, these
communities have to worry about the plant exploding, air emissions,
leaks and other accidents on top of concern from storm impacts and they
often cannot evacuate their neighborhoods and must shelter in place.

These events also have long term impacts on communities that often go
unnoticed and are added to a lifetime of cumulative exposure to these
chemicals including harm to future generations like reproductive health
impacts and developmental delays on young children.

BACKGROUND:

The lawsuit challenges the EPA for its failure to fully remove Startup,
Shutdown and Malfunction (SSM) exemptions from State Implementation
Plans (SIPs) required under the Clean Air Act. A federal appeals court
deemed these SSM loopholes illegal in 2008 and 2014 rulings, and in 2015
the Obama-Biden administration directed dozens of states to close them.
However, the Trump administration reversed much of this progress through
industry-favorable administrative actions.

In May, over 100 community groups sent a letter to President Biden and
EPA Administrator Michael Regan urging action and reminding them,
respectively, of the administrations promises to prioritize
environmental justice:

Mr. President, when you were running for office you promised to use the
full force of your administration to tackle environmental injustice and
the cumulative impacts faced by fenceline communities that have been
forgotten and historically sacrificed by those in power.

Administrator Regan, we appreciate your vital, stated commitment to
environmental justice and we call on you to follow through by taking
swift, meaningful action to protect fenceline communities right to
breathe clean air.

The groups complaint is here. The lawsuit seeks a court order compelling
EPA to fulfill its neglected duties under the Clean Air Act to review
and act on proposed revisions to remove unlawful SSM loopholes from
state plans.

Media innovations drive the economy, shape culture and define our world
view. Media tech companies that show the promise of democratising
entertainment and increase digital adoption are slated to grow the
fastest, shares Vikram Tanna, COO, Mzaalo, in this conversation with BW
Businessworld. Excerpts:

What is your take on the priority order that media tech startups in
India take from an investor's perspective?

It is a golden era for tech platforms with startup funding in the first
half this year crossing the full year funding for last year. Media tech
has become an imperative part of the India strategy with 1.5 billion
digital screens promise. Post-pandemic, while we have seen a significant
shift towards digital in media consumption and revenue, it will catapult
over the next five years with new technologies and changes in consumer
behaviour transforming the ecosystem; with the media tech startups of
today becoming giants of tomorrow.

Among the media startups that have attracted investments, do you see any
underlying characteristic? Is there a type of media startup that
attracts more attention?

Media innovations drive the economy, shape culture and define our world
view. Media tech companies that show the promise of democratising
entertainment and increase digital adoption are slated to grow the most.
The world of M&A is getting replaced by the world of P&A - partnerships
and alliances - with the two becoming critical for success and scale up.
The integration of content and commerce ecosystems holds a great growth
opportunity.

What are the factors that come together to continue to propel the growth
of the media sector in India?

I strongly believe the combination of pricing, technology, democratising
content access and distribution of value will drive the growth of the
media tech companies. Leveraging technology to enhance and personalise
user experience, creating mass scale adoption at speed is a must.
Blockchain use cases in the media ecosystem will lead to a complete
overhaul where consumers and creators will develop a democratic
ecosystem driving distribution of value creation rather than it being
centralised to certain entities.

How are you seeing consumer behaviour change on the whole that is
fuelling the growth of media startups?

There is clearly a pre-Covid and post-Covid era; the mobile screen has
completely taken over consumer mindshare. Consumer behaviour is getting
dictated by individual preferences, attention spans have reduced and
engagement is fragmented with a plethora of choices. For media
companies, this means personalisation, development of new formats,
distribution and partnership with other platforms. Consumers are moving
towards expression of individuality and they expect platforms to offer
personalised, on-demand, immediate and equitable formats, leading to the
need of startups which have the requisite mindset and culture to cater
to this new Indian consumer.

What should media-tech startups do to scale up their operations?

Consumer obsession should be the stepping stone to scale up. Create
products that consumer love, while driving growth with referrals and
word of mouth. Startups need to leverage social media for growth
hacking. Data science is a crucial tool to build consumer communities
around unique sharper data sets with personalised and automated product
experiences. Most importantly, the hiring culture should boost
experimentation, bold risks, imagination, and failure acceptance for
startups to scale up. Staying laser focused on achieving goals is
imperative to success.

What are some of your growth strategies for 2021 and ahead?

At Xfinite, we are committed to redefining the future of on-demand
digital entertainment for the next generation digital media apps
(dApps). We offer a blockchain-based solution powered by Algorand to
ensure transparency and re-establish trust between consumers, content
creators and publishers.

Mzaalo, a gamified video streaming service, is the first dApp on
Xfinite. We are building a social entertainment commerce platform with
our strategy centred around immersive content experience and
gratification. Our blockchain-based reward ecosystem values users' time
and attention, and provides consumers with celebrity experiences,
digital goods and rewards across 600-plus brands. We have partnered with
established platforms like Eros Now, Dailyhunt and SpiceJet to drive
innovation and reach. Mzaalo has been selected by Micorsoft as part of
the Scaleup Program.

What is the primary revenue driver for your company? And how do you plan
to augment this going ahead?

We are transforming the media ecosystem with blockchain use cases and
creating new formats of content distribution and monetisation. The
primary revenue driver for our company is the ability to delight
consumers and constant innovation around that. We believe in bringing
alive the proposition of "Content drives Commerce" -- contextual
content, immersive brand-user experience, and interactivity with digital
goods on blockchain coupled with high consumer watch time and engagement
fuels our growth.

Now that we've spent the past two decades working out how digital
marketing fits in a new business' overall sales and engagement strategy,
we've slowly taken our next step through the looking glass into the next
stage of online business development: growth hacking.

Aaaall the videosWatch all TNW2020 talks on-demand, whenever you want

Yes please

In case you're new to the term, it's exactly like it sounds. It's a
short-term game plan focused on some core digital marketing tenets to
boost brand awareness, cultivate potential customers and create
excitement around a product or service as fast as possible.

It's marketing on digitally-enhanced steroids - and with such a thin
margin for most startups between success and failure, a growth hacking
push could make all the difference. With the training in The Essential
Growth Hacker Bundle ($29, over 90 percent off from TNW Deals), you'll
have the background to devise and execute a growth hacking plan of your
own.

This bundle includes three separate courses with 10 hours of video
content that delves into three critical areas to push brand awareness
and help a business find a foothold in the harsh digital space.

The training starts with the Introduction to Digital Marketing. This is
where even first-time marketers can get the lay of the land as the
training explores all the most important digital channels that a growth
hacker needs to understand to drive success. From social media marketing
to search engine optimization to email campaigns to digital advertising,
learners get a complete overview of how all those factors play into one
sound, built-to-last digital marketing plan.

With social media playing such a vast (and growing) role in establishing
a brand online, the Facebook Marketing and Advertising course goes right
to the still brightest star in the social media universe, Facebook. The
training can help a startup entrepreneur get their Facebook business
page up and running, create best practices for posting engaging content,
and devise effective strategies for using valuable Facebook features
like Facebook Groups, Facebook Live, Facebook Ads, Facebook Insights and
more.

Finally, nothing succeeds with a reasoned, measured management strategy
to drive it all forward - and that's where Lean Management principles
can help. This course gets into the core concepts of Lean, a popular
project management methodology centered on optimized resources and
constant incremental improvements. This process for streamlining your
operations through ongoing systemic changes can then be applied to your
business to help you improve your tools, techniques and ability to set
and analyze your metrics.

Each piece of this collection is a $500 value in itself, but right now,
the whole course package is on sale for about $10 per course, just $29.

Zomato, an Indian online food-delivery company, was opened up to public
market investors on July 14, 2021, and its market debut is being watched
for clues by a number of other online ventures in India, waiting in the
wings to go public. The primary attraction of the company, to investors,
comes not from its current standing (modest revenues and big losses),
but from its positioning to take advantage of the potential growth in
the Indian food delivery market. In this post, I will value Zomato, and
rather than just make a value judgment (which I will), I will also tie
the value per share to macro expectations about the overall market. In
short, I will argue that a bet on Zomato is as much a bet on the
company's business model, as it is a bet on Indian consumers not only
acquiring more buying power and digital access, but also changing their
eating behavior.

Setting the StageAs a lead in to valuing Zomato, it makes sense to look
not just at the company's history, but also at its business model. In
addition, since so much of the excitement about the stock comes from the
potential for growth in the Indian food delivery market, I set the stage
for that analysis by comparing the Indian market to food delivery
markets in other parts of the world, as a prelude to forecasting its
future path.

This Under The Radar Top Performing Value Fund Is Focused On Local TV

first half, while the Russell 2000 was up 4.1% for the second quarter
and Read More

History and Business ModelZomato was founded in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal
and Pankaj Chaddah, as Foodiebay, in response to the difficulties that
they noticed that their office mates were having in downloading menus
for restaurants . Their initial response was a simple one, where they
uploaded soft copies of menus of local restaurants, in Delhi, on to
their website, initially for people in their office, and then to
everyone in the city. As the popularity grew, they expanded their
service to other large Indian cities, and in 2010, they renamed the
company "Zomato", with the tagline of "never have a bad meal". The
business model for the company is built upon intermediation, where
customers can connect to restaurants on the platform, and order food,
for pick up or delivery, and advertising. Along the way, the company has
transitioned from an almost entirely an advertising company to one that
has become increasingly focused on food delivery, and in 2021, the
company derived its revenues primarily from four sources:

-   Transaction Fees: The bulk of Zomato's revenues come from the
    transactions on its platform, from food ordering and delivery, as
    the company keeps a percentage of the total order value for itself.
    While Zomato's revenue slice varies across restaurants, decreasing
    with restaurant profile and reach, it remains about 20-25% of gross
    order value. It is worth noting that Swiggy, Zomato's primary
    competitor in India, also takes a similar percentage of order
    revenues, but Amazon Food, a new entrant into the market, aims to
    take a smaller portion (around 10%) of restaurant revenues.

2.  Advertising: Restaurants that list on Zomato have to pay a fixed fee
    to get listed, but they can also spend more on advertising, based
    upon customer visits and resetting revenues, to get additional
    visibility.

2.  Subscriptions to Zomato Gold (Pro): Zomato also offers a
    subscription service, and subscribers to Zomato Gold (now Zomato
    Pro) get discounts on food and faster deliveries. The service was
    initiated in 2017 and it had 1.5 million plus members in 2021,
    delivering subscription revenues of 600 million rupees (a little
    less than $ 10 million, and less than 5% of overall revenues) in
    2021.

2.  Restaurant Raw Material: In 2018, Zomato introduced HyperPure, a
    service directed at restaurants, offering groceries and meats that
    are source-checked for quality. While direct measures of revenues
    from HyperPure are difficult to come by, the revenues that the
    company shows under traded goods (which include HyperPure revenues)
    suggests that it accounts for about 10% of the total revenues.

In conjunction with the other services it offers to restaurants,
including consulting and data, it suggests that while food delivery and
advertising are the company's primary revenue generators today, it has
ambitions extending into the broader food business. Zomato has grown at
exponential rates for much of the last decade, with a surge in the
number of cities that it serves in India, especially in the last few
years, from 38 in 2017 to 63 in 2018 to more than 500 in 2021, extending
its reach into smaller urban settings.

Revenues did drop in 2020, as COVID restrictions put a crimp on the
restaurant business, but the quarterly data suggests that business is
coming back. Along the way, the company has expanded its business
outside India, with the United Arab Emirates being its biggest foreign
market. That revenue growth has been driven partly by acquisitions that
the company has made along the way:

Source: Crunchbase

To fund these acquisitions and other internal growth investments, the
company has been reliant on venture capitalists, who have supplied it
with capital in multiple rounds since 2011:

Source: Crunchbase

These capital infusions created a diverse ownership structure at the
company, even prior to its going public:

Source: Zomato Prospectus

The share of the equity owned but the original founders of the company
has dropped dramatically over time, as the company has had to raise
capital to fund its ambitious growth agenda, and Deepinder Goyal owns
only 5.55% of the company's shares, prior to the IPO. Uber's ownership
in Zomato is a result of Zomato's acquisition of Uber Eats India, where
Uber received a share of Zomato's equity in exchange. As revenues have
grown, the business model for the company has been slower to evolve, as
the company has reported extensive losses along the way, as you will see
in the next section.

The MarketZomato's business model is neither innovative, nor
groundbreaking, resembling other online food delivery companies in other
parts of the world, like DoorDash , which had its initial public
offering in 2020. The allure to investors comes from Zomato's core
market in India, and the potential for growth in that market. To get a
measure of this potential, I start by comparing the size of food
delivery markets in India to the food delivery markets in China, the
United States and the EU.

Zomato Prospectus and Other Sources for EU data

The Indian food delivery market is small, relative to markets elsewhere
in the world, and especially compared to China, the only other market of
equivalent size in terms of population. There are three reasons for the
smaller food delivery market in India, and they are highlighted in the
table above:

2.  Lower per-capita income: Eating out and prosperity don't always go
    hand in hand, but you are more likely to eat out, as your
    discretionary income rises. Thus, it should come as no surprise that
    the number of restaurants increases with per capita GDP, and that
    one reason for the paucity of restaurants(and food delivery) in
    India is its low GDP, less than a fifth of per capital GDP in China
    and a fraction of per capital GDP in the US & EU.

2.  Less digital reach: To use online restaurant services, you first
    need to be online, and digital reach in India, in spite of advances
    in recent years, lags digital reach in China, and is about half the
    reach in the US and the EU.

2.  Eating habits: Looking across the regions, it seems clear that there
    is a third factor at play, a pre-disposition on the part of the
    populace, to eat out. Looking at the number of restaurants in China
    and the size of its food delivery market, it is quite clear that
    Chinese consumers are far more willing to eat out (either in person
    at or with delivery from restaurants) than people living in the US
    and EU, especially if you control for per capita income differences.

The Zomato story, or at least the upbeat version of it, is that the
Indian food delivery/restaurant market will grow, as Indians become more
prosperous and have increased online access. A simplistic way to
illustrate the difference is to adjust the size of the market for
per-capita income and digital reach, and I attempt to do that, relative
to the Chinese market, in the table below:Used 2019 food delivery market
number for India, and 2020 numbers for every thing else, in scaling up;
COVID effect on 2020 Indian food delivery market very different from the
rest of the world

Put simply, even if Indians had the same per-capita income and digital
reach as Chinese consumers, the food delivery market in India would be
far smaller than the Chinese market, perhaps because eating out is not
as much as entrenched in Indian eating behavior. You can find multiple
flaws with these comparisons, but the core fundamentals that will
determine the size of the Indian food delivery market are clear. The
size of the market in future years will be determined by how robustly
the Indian economy will grow in the next few years, how quickly
digitization continues its advance in the country and if and whether
Indians become more open to eating out than they have historically.

Zomato: Story and ValuationWith the lead in on Zomato's history and
business model, I can start constructing a story and valuation for the
company, with the recognition that the biggest part of the story is in
its macro elements. It stands to reason that disagreements about the
story will be largely on those macro components, rather than in the
company-specific components.

The Prospectus

To get the assessment of the company started, I began by looking at
Zomato's prospectus and all of the concerns I noted about excessive and
distracting disclosure that I laid out in last week's post on the topic,
came rushing back to me. The Zomato IPO clocks in at 420 pages , much of
it designed to bore readers into submission. Let's start with the
useless or close to useless parts:

-   Definitions and abbreviations: The prospectus starts, and I wonder
    whether this is by design, with 17 pages of abbreviations of terms,
    some of which are obvious and need no definition (board of
    directors, shareholders), some of which are meaningless even when
    expanded (19 classes of preferred shares, all of which will be
    replaced with common shares after the IPO) and some of which are
    just corporate names.

1.  Risk Profile: If you did not believe my assertions about the
    pointlessness of risk sections in IPOs, please do read all 30 pages
    of Zomato's risk profile (pages 39-68 of the prospectus). The
    company lists 69 different risks investors may face from investing
    in the company, and after you have read them all, I dare you to list
    three on that list that you would remember. The risk profile starts
    with a statement that the company has a history of net losses and
    anticipates increased expenses in the future and goes on to add
    invaluable nuggets such as the "COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar
    public health hazard, has had an impact on the our business".

1.  Subsidiary/Holdings Mess: I find it mind boggling that a company
    that is only thirteen years old has managed to accumulate as many
    subsidiaries, both in India and overseas, as Zomato has done. Since
    Zomato owns 100% of most of these subsidiaries, there may be legal
    or tax reasons for this structure, but there is no denying that it
    adds complexity (and pages) to the prospectus, with no real
    information benefits.

If you do make your way through this mush, there is useful information
in the prospectus about the company's economics:

-   Growth & Profitability trends: The company provides three years of
    financial statements in the prospectus (2018-19, 2019-20 and
    2020-21) and you can get a sense of the company's growth and
    profitability trends by looking at the annual numbers: Zomato
    Prospectus Since the numbers for 2020 are distorted by the COVID
    shutdown, the company provides quarterly numbers for the most recent
    quarters to argue that the growth reversal in 2020 will be quickly
    put in the rearview mirror: Zomato prospectus , with 2020 Q1 & Q2
    numbers estimatedNote the sharp and predictable drops in gross
    orders in the first two quarters of the 2021 fiscal year, but also
    the increase in gross orders in the last quarter of FY 2021 (the
    first quarter of the 2021 calendar year), as the shut downs ease up.

1.  Unit Economics: The company does provide a sprinkling of unit
    economics to suggest that the underlying business is moving towards
    profitability. The lead in their argument is the contribution
    margin, i.e., the slice of the a typical order that is left as
    profits, after covering the costs of catering to that order:Zomato
    ProspectusWhile the graph shows improvement, it is worth noting that
    the improvement is based upon a single year's (2021) numbers. There
    are, however, other facts about the unit economics that lend to
    optimism on the story. In particular, there is some evidence in the
    cohort table, where Zomato customers are broken down by how long
    they have been using the platform, that usage increases for more
    long-standing customers:Zomato Prospectus The users who joined the
    Zomato platform in 2017 were not only ordering three times more than
    they were initially by the time they had been on the platform four
    years, but were also more likely to continue ordering at those
    levels in the 2021 fiscal year, when COVID put a dent in the Indian
    food delivery business. This is good news, but to make full sense of
    it, it would have been informative to see what percent of each
    year's users stayed active on the platform in subsequent years, but
    I could not find that statistic in the prospectus.

1.  Competitive Advantages: The competitive advantage section could have
    been cut and pasted from a dozen Silicon Valley companies in the
    last decade, with the networking benefit captured in a loop, where
    the more a platform gets used, the more benefits it provides to
    those on it, thus creating more usage: Zomato Prospectus and Uber
    ProspectusNote the similarities between the picture to the left,
    from the Zomato prospectus, and the picture to the right is from the
    Uber prospectus, from 2019. That said, there is an element of truth
    in these pictures about how growth can lead to more growth, but
    neither picture addresses the fundamental business question of how
    to monetize this growth, since neither ride sharing nor food
    delivery has figured out how to be profitable.

1.  Proceeds: The company's plans for what it intends to do with the
    proceeds are mixed. A portion of the initial offering will represent
    the cashing out of Info Edge, one of the first venture capital
    providers to Zomato, and that has no direct effect on the valuation.
    Another portion, amounting to approximately 9 billion INR will
    remain in the firm, to cover future cash needs.

It would be churlish on my part to take issue with the bloat and
selective disclosure in Zomato's prospectus, since they are following
the script that other technology companies around the world have written
for going public, but it is frustrating to read through 420 pages, and
still be left in the dark on key numbers.

The Story & ValuationThe story that I will tell for Zomato has several
moving parts to it, but it can be broken down into the following
components:

-   Total Market: This is the assumption that will make or break Zomato
    as a company, since so much of the potential in the company is
    dependent on how the food delivery/restaurant market in India
    evolves over the next decade. As I noted in an earlier section, even
    allowing for robust growth in India and improved digital access, I
    find it hard to see the total market exceeding $40 billion, with US
    $25 billion, in ten years, being a more likely outcome. (In rupee
    terms, this will translate into a market that is roughly 1800-2000
    billion INR.)

1.  Market Share: The Indian food delivery market is dominated by two
    big players, Zomato and Swiggy, with a third player, Amazon Foods,
    that is unlikely to fade away. In my story, I will assume that the
    market will continue to be dominated by two or three large players,
    albeit with lots of localized and niche competitors who will
    continue to command a significant slice of the market. Expecting any
    company to have a market share that exceeds 40% of this market is a
    reach, and I will assume that Zomato will be one of the
    winners/survivors. In making this judgment, it is worth noting that
    the online food delivery markets in other parts of the world (US,
    China) seem to be also approaching a steady state of a few large
    players.

1.  Revenue Share: While the market share and total market yield the
    gross order value for Zomato, the company posts only its share of
    these orders, as revenues. That number was 23.13% in FY 2020, but
    dropped to 21.03% in FY 2021, as shut downs put a crimp on business.
    I will assume a partial bounce back to 22% of GOV, starting in 2022,
    but the presence of Amazon Food will prevent a return to higher
    values in the future.

1.  Profitability: The profitability of intermediary businesses (ride
    sharing, apartment renting, food delivery) that use platforms to
    connect users to service or product providers is still being worked
    out, but the contours of how this will play out are visible. The
    biggest expenses at these companies are often on customer
    acquisition and marketing, and as growth scales down, these expenses
    should decrease, as a percent of revenues, delivering a
    profitability bonus. The biggest challenge that these businesses
    face are in the absence of stickiness and exclusivity, since users
    can have multiple food delivery apps on their devices and pick the
    cheapest one, and in balancing the competing needs of users and
    service/product providers with very different needs. For a food
    delivery service, restaurants and customers are integral to the
    business, and providing a better deal for one may come at the
    expense of the other. Online food delivery businesses around the
    world, and Zomato is no exception, are facing backlash from
    restaurants and delivery personnel, who believe that they are
    getting the short end of the stick, as the company seeks to offer
    lower prices and better delivery deals from customers. I will assume
    that pre-tax operating margins will trend towards 30%, largely
    because I believe that the market will be dominated by a few big
    players, but with the very real possibility that one rogue player
    that is unwilling to play the game can upend profitability. The
    scariest part of the food delivery market for Zomato is the identity
    of its new entrant (Amazon Food), since Amazon is the most fearsome
    competitor on the planet, willing to out-wait any company, if its
    intent is to capture a market.

1.  Reinvestment: One of the advantages of being an intermediary
    business is that you can grow with relatively little capital
    investment, defined in conventional form (as plant, equipment or
    manufacturing facilities). That said, reinvestment takes a different
    form for companies like Zomato, with investments in technology and
    in acquisitions , driving future growth. I highlighted the
    acquisitions that Zomato has made over its lifetime, with UberEats
    India as its most recent and most expensive illustration, but also
    noted that the company has burned through billions in cash to get to
    where it is today. I will assume that this need will continue in the
    near future, with a lightening up in later years, as growth
    declines.

1.  Risk: In terms of operating risk, the company, in spite of its
    global ambitions, is still primarily an Indian company, dependent on
    Indian macroeconomic growth to succeed, and my rupee cost of capital
    will incorporate the country risk. Zomato is a money losing company,
    but it is not a start-up, facing imminent failure. On the plus side,
    its size and access to capital, as well as its post-IPO augmented
    cash balance, push down the risk of failure. On the minus side, this
    is a company that is still burning through cash and will need access
    to capital in future years to continue to survive. Overall, I will
    attach a likelihood of failure of 10%, reflecting this balance.

With the story in place, and the inputs that come out of it, the
valuation, in a sense, does itself, and you can see the summary of the
numbers below:

Download spreadsheet

With my upbeat story of growth and profitability, the value that I
derive for equity is close to 394 billion INR (about $5.25 billion),
translating into a value per share of 41 INR. That may seem like a lot
to pay for a money-losing company with less than 20 billion INR in
revenues in the most recent year, but promise and potential have value,
especially when you have a leader in a market of immense size. That
said, the stock's pricing (72-75 INR, per share) makes it too expensive,
notwithstanding my story.

Facing up to UncertaintyIf you who are wondering whether the assumptions
that underlie my Zomato valuation could be wrong, let me set your mind
at rest by assuring you that they most certainly are, and it does not
bother me in the least. The reason that they are wrong is simple. I do
not control the future, and no matter how many tools and current
information I bring to the process, there will be surprises down the
road. The reason it does not bother me is because, as I have said many
times before, you don't have to be right to make money, just less wrong
than everyone else. I do think there is a benefit to being open about
uncertainty and facing up to it, rather than viewing it as something to
be avoided or acting as if it is not there. I will use one of my
favorite tools, a Monte Carlo simulation, and quantify the uncertainty I
foresee in three of my most critical assumptions.

-   Total Market Size: A major driver of Zomato's value is the expected
    evolution of the Indian food delivery market. While I projected the
    market to increase to about $25 billion in my base case, that is
    based upon assumptions about economic growth and digital reach in
    India that could be wrong. In the simulation, I allow for a market
    size of between $10 billion (about 750-800 billion rupees) to $40
    billion (3000-3200 billion INR).

1.  Market Share: In the base case, I assume that Zomato's share of the
    market will stabilize around 40% by year 5, premised on the belief
    that this will be a market with two or three big players, a a
    multitude of niche businesses. Given the regional diversity of the
    Indian market, it is possible that there may be more players in the
    market, in steady state, resulting in a lower market share (as low
    as 20%) or that the niche players will get pushed out, because of
    economies of scale, yielding a higher market share (up to 50%).

1.  Operating Margin: The operating margin of 30% that I predicted in my
    base case for Zomato is built on the presumption that the status quo
    will prevail, and that the delivery companies will be able to
    continue to see economies of scale, while holding their slice of the
    order value stable. If one of the players decides to aggressively go
    for higher market share (by offering discounts or bidding more for
    delivery personnel), operating margins will tend lower (15% is my
    low end). If, on the other hand, Zomato is able to keep its
    advertising business intact as it moves forward, it could delivery
    higher margin (45% is my upper end).

Notice that there are two assumptions that analysts often lose sleep
over that I am ignoring. The first is the reinvestment each year, that I
estimate using a sales to capital ratio that varies across time. It
affects my cash flows, but its effect on value is dwarfed by changes in
assumptions about market size and share. The second is the cost of
capital, a number that most valuation classes and books (including mine)
belabor to the point of diminishing returns. Raising or lowering the
cost of capital has an effect on value, but changing my assumptions
about risk premiums, betas or debt ratios has a much smaller effect that
changing assumptions that alter cash flows. The results of the
simulations that I ran with distributions replacing point estimates for
market size, share and operating margin are shown below:

Put simply, I think it is hubris to dismiss those who invested in Zomato
at 72 INR per share or higher, as speculators or ill-informed, since
there are plausible stories that get you to values higher than 100 INR
per share. That said, given my story and valuation for the company, I
think that at a 70-75 INR per share price, the stock looks over valued
to me.

Add ons and DistractionsThe most dangerous moments, when valuing a
company, are after you think you are done, as those who disagree with
your valuation (on either side) come up with reasons for adding premiums
for positives about the company that you may have missed, if they want a
higher value, or discounts for negatives about the company that you
should have incorporated, if they want a lower value. In this section, I
will start with the argument that a platform with millions of users
offers optionality, a reasonable basis for a premium, but one where it
can be difficult to attach a number to the value. Second, I will
consider whether the fact that India is a big market makes Zomato
deserving of a premium, and make a case that it is not. Third, I will
confront the oft used contention that value is in the eye of the
beholder, i.e., that Zomato is worth a lot because other investors
believe it to be worth a lot, and examine a pricing rationale for
Zomato. Finally, dismissing Zomato as an investment, just because it
does not make money now, or fails to meet some conventional value tests
on pricing (PE, Price to Book), is investing malpractice.

1. Platform Optionality

As a company with millions of users on its platform, there is an added
layer to value for Zomato or any other platform-based company, that goes
beyond the intrinsic valuation above. In effect, if Zomato can deliver
other products and services to the users of the platform, it can augment
its earnings and value. This is the "optionality" that some investors
highlight in companies with large user bases (Amazon Prime, Uber,
Netflix), but while I see the basis for the argument, I would offer some
caveats.

-   First, not all platforms are created equal, in terms of being adding
    value, with platforms with more intense users and proprietary data
    having more value than platforms where users are transitory and
    there is little exclusive data being collected. One reason that I
    bought Facebook shares in 2018, after the Cambridge Analytica
    scandal, was my belief that its platform has immense value because
    of its reach (more than 2 billion users in its ecosystem), their
    engagement (Facebook users stay in the ecosystem for long periods)
    and the data that Facebook collects, through their engagement
    (posts, comments etc.).

1.  Second, even if you believe that there is optionality, attach a
    numerical value to that option is one of the most difficult tasks in
    investment. While there are option pricing models that can be
    adapted to do the valuation, getting the inputs for these models,
    especially before the optionality takes form, is difficult to do.
    With Facebook, in 2018, I arrived at an intrinsic value that was
    only modestly higher than the price (<10%), but used the optionality
    as the argument for pulling the buy trigger.

Zomato's platform has the benefit of large numbers, but it falls short
on both intensity and proprietary data. Thus, Zomato app users are on
the system only when they order food, and the engagement is often
restricted to food ordering and delivery. If Zomato plans to expand its
offerings to its platform-users, it is very likely that these add-on
businesses will be food-related, perhaps extending into grocery
shopping, creating some option value.

2. A Big Market Premium?<

Indian and Chinese companies, especially in young and nascent
businesses, have an advantage that they often play to, which is immense
local markets. It is not surprising that companies play up this
advantage, when marketing themselves to investors, with some analysts
attaching premiums to value, just because of market size. I believe that
this is a distraction, because that market size should already by
incorporated into the intrinsic value, through growth and margin
expectations. In my base case valuation of Zomato, I assume that
revenues will increase almost ten-fold over the next 10 years, because
the Indian market is expected to grow so strongly. In fact, the danger
to investors, when faced with Indian and Chinese companies, is not that
they will under value these companies, but that they will over value
them, precisely because the markets are so big. In a post and companion
paper , I describe this as the big market delusion, where investors do
not factor in the competition that will come from existing and new
players, drawn into the business by the size of the market, and the
resulting drop in profitability.

3. A Pricing Rationale

When you value young companies with promise, the most common push back
that you will get is that value is whatever people perceive it to be,
and young companies can therefore have any value that investors will
sustain. This is a distortion of the word value, but it is true that
young companies are more likely to be priced than valued, and the
pricing will be based upon a simple pricing metric (anything from PE to
EV/Sales) and what investors perceive to be the peer group. With Zomato,
for instance, there are two ways in which investors may attach a pricing
to the company.

-   VC Pricing: The first is to look at venture capitalists priced the
    company at, in their most recent funding rounds, and extrapolating
    from that number. In its February 2021 VC round, Zomato was priced
    at close to 400 billion INR ($5.4 billion) by a group of venture
    capitalists (including Fidelity and Tiger Global), who invested
    almost 50 billion INR (about $660 million) in the company.

1.  Comparable companies: The only direct comparable that Zomato has in
    India is Swiggy, which is still privately funded, At the risk of
    stretching the definition of "comparable firm", I compare Zomato's
    pricing (using the projected 72-75 INR share price on the IPO) to
    the pricing of Doordash, which went public in 2020:

The bottom line is that pricing is not a panacea for uncertainty or a
cure for bias, since the uncertainty is just pushed into the background
and there is plenty of room for biases to play out, in how you
standardize price (which multiple you use) and and what your comparable
are.

4. It is a money loser

There are good arguments to be made against investing in Zomato at is
proposed offering price, but one of the emptiest, and laziest, is that
it is losing money right now. I know that for some value investors,
trained to believe that anything that trades at more than 10 or 15 times
earnings or at well above book value, this argument suffices, but given
how badly this has served them over the last two decades, they should
revisit the argument. The biggest reason that Zomato is losing money is
because it is a young company that is trying to take advantage of a
market with immense growth potential, not because it cannot make money.
In fact, if Zomato cut back on customer acquisitions and platform
investments, my guess is that it could show an accounting profit, but if
it did so, it would be worth a fraction of what it is today.

ConclusionIn investing and valuation, there is the presumption that
rules and even the first principles of investing change as you go from
one market to another, and this is particularly true when comparisons
are made between developed and emerging markets. I believe that the
first principles of valuation are the same in all markets, and I hope
that I have stayed true to that belief in this post. I valued Zomato,
using the same process that I used to value Doordash, with the
country-specific effects being incorporated into my growth and risk
projections. While I did take issue with some of the holes and over
reach in Zomato's disclosures, I ran into the same challenges, when I
valued Doordash. Zomato is a money-losing, cash burning enterprise now,
but it has immense market potential and is on track to delivering on a
viable business model. It will face plenty of challenges on that path,
both at the micro level (management, competition) and at the macro level
(economic and political developments in India). I believe that the
company is currently over priced, given its potential, but I would have
no qualms about investing in the stock, if the price drops in the near
future, with the full understanding that this is a joint wager on a
company, a sector and a country.

Sep 11, 2019( e27: http://www.e27.sg Delivered by Newstex) 6 things
millennials need to know before they step up into the big game One of
the biggest concerns that millennials have is the idea that they're not
making a difference in their workplace. The reason why this is so
troublesome for them is due to the fact that some of them have the
unrealistic expectation of making a difference from the first day in
their workplace. Needless to say, the only way to make this work is to
actually be the person in charge, which is why millennials seem to be
showing a surprising amount of entrepreneurial spirit. Still, the
business world often turns out to be a place unlike what they've
expected it to be.

Therefore, here are six things they need to know to be ready for what
lies ahead.Understand why so many people failThe first thing you need to
do is figure out why so many enterprises fail[1]. For instance, there
could be no market need for your business, you might lack a competent
team or your competition might be too tough. Also Read:The millennial
force: changing the workplace and its culture[2] One of the ways to look
at this from the right perspective would be to take a look at the list
and try to see if any of these concerns would be true in your particular
case. Once you get this out of the way, you'll drastically increase the
odds of your own business making it.Invest in proper educationAnother
thing you should think about is your investment in education. One of the
biggest problems that millennials (even non-entrepreneurs) face when it
comes to financing, is the fact that they're both confident and lack
knowledge in the field. Therefore, you need to invest in your own
education by either looking for a competent mentor or by finding the
right online course to embark on. Even the concept of microlearning can
turn out to be quite beneficial for an aspiring entrepreneur.Become more
resourcefulPerhaps the most important thing for making it in the
business world is the concept of being resourceful. What this means is
being able to achieve a maximum effect with what you've got. Also
Read:This app helps Indian millennials enhance their mind and soul
wellness[3] You see, when it comes to boosting the profit of your
enterprise, the majority of people heavily focus on increasing income.
What they fail to realize is that reducing the costs of running a
business can get you there just as fast (sometimes even faster). You can
do this by saving power, embracing more effective business practices and
reducing the cost of office supplies[4].Drop deadweightMaking the right
team is incredibly important, however, sometimes, when hiring, you're
not looking at all the right traits of potential employees. For
instance, in your quest for ideal candidates, what you'll be looking at
is their performance, their work experience and their education. Still,
this doesn't reveal their personality. There are some types of people
who can run your business into the ground[5] by just well, being
themselves. We're talking about emotional vampires, backstabbers and
more.Don't wait for too longBy waiting for too long, you risk missing
your window of opportunity. You see, any data that you've gathered has
an expiry date, which means that if you do your research, determine that
it's not the right time to start your own business[6] at the moment and
wait for a year or two, the validity of the data will become quite
questionable. Factors change and keeping track of them might become
harder and harder as the time progresses. Why? Well, because you will
carry your prejudices (from previous research sessions) with you.
Planning is great but eventually, you need to get into the middle of
things.Prepare for the unexpectedAs Mike Tyson once said, everyone has a
plan until they get punched in the mouth. The same thing will happen to
your business. Even if you do everything right, prepare enough cash, do
a survey on your target demographic and hire the most competent of
teams, you'll have to face a scenario where things don't go according to
plan. Also Read:An entrepreneur should lay down annual milestones, it
helps break down your vision into clear targets[7] The most important
thing here is that you understand just how normal this is and try to
adjust, rather than waste too much energy trying to steer everything
back on the previous track. Flexibility is the key to surviving in any
industry. By embracing these points, you'll ensure that you're not as
easily surprised, startled or caught off-guard. Sure, it's impossible to
be ready for all that lies ahead, nonetheless, by remaining flexible and
proactive you'll become a lot more resilient. The most important thing
you need to understand is that just because things are not doing as
you've expected, this still doesn't mean that they're going in the wrong
direction. - Editor's note:e27publishes relevant guest contributions

Spotting business stress indicators early

OTHERS

Every business faces challenges. These are influenced not only by
external factors like the pandemic but also by internal factors such as
limited planning, implementation errors, efficiency issues, marketing
gaps, and an unskilled workforce. Identifying and addressing problems
effectively will determine if a business survives or if it will be
consigned to the corporate graveyard that history is replete with.

Business sickness

It is considered business sickness when the banking account of the
borrower of the enterprise remains as a non-performing asset for a
period exceeding 90 days or more for either non-payment of principal due
or interest, or if there is an erosion in the net worth due to
accumulated losses to the extent of 50 per cent of its net worth, or if
the financial statements of the company indicates cash losses for two
consecutive years. It is a perfect imbalance in the debt-equity ratio
and an alteration in the financial position of the company. The
existence of any one of the above-specified conditions, significantly
increases the chances of recovery. One could spot it in the financial
statements but there is a need for a more dynamic model.

Dynamic monitoring

Every organisation should constantly monitor its break-even point on a
regular basis. It is the level of activity in the organisation where the
'sales contribution' equals the fixed costs of the company.

Liquidity is the lifeline of any business which is a function of the
speed at which the company can rotate its inventory and receivables or
the cash-to-cash cycle. Excessive lock up will inevitably lead to
choking and creating stress in the system. To create liquidity, the
organisation will be forced to increase discounts which would put the
margins under pressure and dwindling profitability.

Cost of Quality is a methodology used to define and measure what amount
of an organisation's resources are consumed due to lack of quality and
where. In other words, there are four broad categories where these costs
start creeping up - internal failures, external failures, appraisal
costs, and preventive costs. An increase in these is a clear indicator
of corporate weakness and the business' inability to sustain in the
medium to long term.

The convergence of technology has increased pressures on all businesses,
for some more than others. The relevance of products or services and
mode of delivery is changing dramatically, and an organisation's
inability to adapt could lead to financial stress.

Corporate stress, much like human systems, is part of the lifecycle. The
key is to recognise the symptoms early on and work towards resolving
them before it gets out of hand.

The hidden cost of being a founder

December 18 -- If I were to pick one thing that unites the global tech
scene in terms of culture I would point to the respect and reverence
accorded to startup founders.

After all, creating your own company is an ambition many of us harbor.
It can bring with it unparalleled freedom, a lasting legacy, prestige,
wealth and the ability to do good. Across social and traditional media
the feats of founders big and small are lauded for their genius on a
daily basis. Many entrepreneurs go to great lengths to showcase their
backbreaking hard work and eye-popping success. An outsider would be
forgiven for believing that every founder is living the dream as a
result of their talent and toil.

Of course, as with nearly every image projected online, the reality is
quite different. There is a seldom talked about price of being a
founder - the impact on one's mental health.

A recent study by the National Institute of Mental Health found that 72%
of entrepreneurs are directly or indirectly impacted by mental health
issues. This compares to 48% of the general population. The damage can
also affect loved ones - 23% of entrepreneurs report that they have
family members with problems, which is 7% higher than the relations of
nonentrepreneurs.

I am in no way a mental health expert. But what I do know from both my
own experience and speaking to scores of business owners I work with is
that being a founder is an inherently lonely job. Pressure is high and
uncertainty pervades every decision. Fear of failure is ever present.
Unaddressed, these issues can take a serious toll.

The unpalatable truth is that the situation appears to be getting worse.
A similar study conducted in 2015 by Dr. Michael A. Freeman found the
rate of mental health issues among founders to be lower - at 50%. While
comparing different research pieces is inexact, we only need to look at
how the global recession has damaged many companies and how working from
home has contributed to feelings of isolation, to know that the
environment for startups has got harder this year. Added to this mix is
how social media continues to promote an unhealthy fetishization of
hustle culture and founding myths.

A number of founders have told me that they have constant feelings of
inadequacy and guilt when they compare themselves to the startup gurus
who celebrate working 24/7, are constantly selling, raising money or
making their millions. They feel they should be working harder or be
doing better - just like all the people they read about.

So how do we address this? The first step is talking about it. This
means having an environment where we can be honest that not everything
is always fine. Speaking to a fellow founder, not about commercial
concerns, but about personal worries can be revelatory. I've seen it
happen in our community. It's like an "Emperor's New Clothes" moment.

The myth of the bulletproof, genius, hustling founder can disappear in a
puff of smoke as people suddenly realize they are not alone. They find
that the concerns, anxieties and uncertainties they feel are almost
universal.

Experienced founders can provide invaluable support to people new to the
startup scene. They can share their experiences, both failures and
success, and reveal some of their coping mechanisms. I would strongly
advise founders who are experiencing some of the worries I've outlined
to actively seek out advice from both their peers and potential
mentors - much in the way they may seek out commercial guidance.

Next, we need to address how we tackle the culture and myths around
being a founder. Business owners need to know that many of the
extraordinary "success stories" they see celebrated online are exactly
that - extraordinary.

Similarly, those that promote the principle that working all hours is
the only way to be successful are at best talking about what works for
them, and are at worst, engaging in a performance to achieve attention.
We need to think carefully about how we respond to these posts. There is
a fine line between being supportive and enabling unhealthy or damaging
behavior and philosophy.

After all, success in the startup scene is all relative. For some owning
a small business that makes them a decent income with a good work-life
balance is the goal. For others, it is simply being able to do what they
love in the way that they want. Very few will get the exit that makes
them a millionaire, and an infinitesimally small minority will build the
next Facebook . I cannot stress enough how important it is for founders
to keep their aims and ambitions in perspective and ignore the noise
they hear online.

More broadly, the industry, including the media, does need to get wiser
about how it views and represents founders. For example, a pervasive
myth is that some of the biggest tech companies in the world started in
garages with no money, then through the genius and sheer
bloodymindedness of their founder they were grown into a massive
corporation.

The reality is that the vast majority of these tech companies benefited
from substantial seed capital from family or connections almost from day
one. These founders were also quickly surrounded by highly talented
people who did a lot of the heavy lifting and, whisper it, a truckload
of good luck. In short, the idea of the superhuman founder perpetuated
in the industry is, in nearly all cases, nonsense.

In a similar vein, there are also issues around how we frame success and
failure.

Success, as I've mentioned earlier, is nearly always couched in the most
basic numerical terms. The "unicorn" label is bandied about so often
that many people fail to realize that it's simply a valuation that a few
investors have given a company. It does not reflect whether the business
is actually successful in the traditional sense, i.e., making money.
Generally, the startup scene celebrates and idolizes founders who make
big exits or achieve "unicorn status" - less is spoken about the
thousands of SMEs that employ people, develop and patent new tech, make
a tidy profit and pay taxes.

With failure, there is an altogether different problem. The startup
scene downplays failure as par for the course. It is, on the face of it,
one of the industry's great virtues. It enables people to try without
fear of embarrassment. However, in practice, it can actually minimize
real-world fears nearly all founders have. Failure cannot just be
brushed off if you've devoted years of your life, spent a lot of money
and have staff who rely on you. By simply thinking of failure as part of
the process we cannot address and talk about this real source of concern
in an open way. "Fail fast" only works for those who can afford it.

Individually, these issues may seem like nothing but white noise and the
cure for suffering founders may simply be to get off social media.
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. Social and traditional media is
amplifying startup culture, not creating it. The same tropes are on
display at every tech conference and meetup. To fit in, the founder is
expected to be a fearless, genius visionary. Deviation from this norm,
such as by displaying vulnerability around mental health, is by
inference, failure.

Despite its shortcomings in relation to diversity, the startup scene is
generally one of the most progressive, collaborative and open industries
in the world. These virtues are ideally suited to tackling the
reluctance to discuss mental health and creating the network of support
that ensures people don't suffer alone.

To make this happen, we need to dispense with the myths and hagiography
around being a founder and be more honest about what the reality of
running a business actually entails.

The rise of social entrepreneurship is a topic that either excites you -
or one you glance over because of a failure to understand its role and
socioeconomic impact. Either way, we're here to provide some insights
based on our experience at the Social Enterprise World Forum.

Firstly, it is important not to confuse social entrepreneurship with
charity - social enterprises are for-profit businesses that focus on
solving social issues, or provide goods and services like any another
business, but offer impact beyond financial success.

The thing that all social enterprises have in common, is that they
reinvest the majority of their profits in support of a social or
environmental cause and play a crucial role in uplifting marginalised
communities. And while there is great traction in social
entrepreneurship across the globe, there is still much to do: Success
should not be measured on what we have achieved, but on what we still
have left to accomplish, acknowledges James Okina, Street Priests Inc.

If you think only millennials and Gen Z support brands associated with
societal impact, think again. Across the globe, there is a mindful
movement of consumers and prospective employees who are becoming
increasingly interested in engaging with businesses that support worthy
causes and that understand the role they play in solving societal
issues.

<!--EMBED:https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/701/197282.html
:EMBED-->

In October 2019, more than 1,200 social enterprises, activists,
politicians, and advocates from 70 countries gathered in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia for the 12 Annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF). Among
them, SAP hosted 48 entrepreneurs from across the world in support of
connecting global innovators and growing the social entrepreneurship
movement. Here are our top 5 takeaways from the Social Enterprise World
Forum that we believe others can learn from:

- Economics first

Don t get so caught up in your passion that you forget to build a viable
business. Melat Yosef, Vitabite.

Through various testimonies delivered at SEWF2019, it is clear that many
social enterprise startups fail. In fact, startup failure rates range
from 80-90%. Sometimes, barriers to market outnumber opportunities to
market. Sometimes failure is purely as a result of the additional layer
of complexity, namely societal impact.

As a social entrepreneur, your situation might be that capital is
limited both human and cashflow. The demand for your offering is
abundant and the community need is high. Ask yourself: As a social
enterprise, should you first focus on commercial viability and revenue
so that you can deliver greater impact in support of your purpose? Or
should you instead focus on delivering on your promise of societal
impact that, in turn, will attract and retain customers?

This chicken and egg scenario was highly debated at the forum. In our
minds, there is a clear winner in the argument. As a social
entrepreneur, you must always offer superior products and/or services to
lead the market. Holding the designation of social enterprise or
entrepreneur doesn t mean you can offer substandard offerings. Customers
demand excellence regardless of the social element of this endeavour.
Keep your standards high and your costs low, asserted Nikki Germany,
chief growth officer of e-commerce provider, Copia.

Tenacity is key to survival. Various of the social entrepreneurs we
spoke to, testified that they were only successful at their second or
third attempt in establishing their business. If you re part of the
majority whose organisation has failed, Bernard Kirk, Founder and CEO of
The Camden Education Trust urges you not to give up. You might fail now,
but that will lead to success later on down the road.

- The Call for Capacity-building

Most people and organisations got their start with one big break. Can
you play a role in creating someone else s one big break? Cathy Smith,
Managing Director, SAP Africa

According to the United Nations, Africa s population will double by
2050, with sub-Saharan Africa making up as much as a quarter of the
world s population. More than half of the estimated 2.4 billion people
will be under the age of 25 - and without education, training, or
employment. This problem is not isolated to Africa, but rather an
opportunity for the world to sustainably integrate a large population of
changemakers into the global economy. While governments may be
responsible for creating the right conditions and legislation to address
the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, business is in a unique position
to help.

The concept of building capacity simply means one organisation helping
another to operate better, expanding its capabilities. In the case of
SAP, for example, we have sent more than 1,000 SAP employees to more
than 350 organisations worldwide through the SAP Social Sabbatical to
help social enterprises and non-profits overcome strategic business
challenges. As of 2018, this global pro bono program implemented by
PYXERA Global has delivered an in-kind contribution of 15.8M and 279,000
service hours, impacting 4.9M lives. Specifically, organisations like
DreamOval Foundation in Ghana reported a 100% growth in its ICT
education following a Social Sabbatical engagement which sparked the
introduction of a new program, Females in Tech Initiatives (FemiTI).

The question remains how do we build capacity at scale? How do we use
technology platforms, skilled talent and access to markets to create
that one big break for organisations to succeed? Every sector - private,
public, and social - has a role to play in creating a chain reaction of
big breaks. What role will you play?

- Partnership

These types of partnerships or opportunities to collaborate are
essential to our work. Without them, we simply would not be able to
deliver on our mandate. Francis Ahene-Affoh, DreamOval Foundation

There is complexity in the problems we are trying to solve. They are all
interconnected. We can t solve a problem like quality education without
understanding poverty, food scarcity and gender equality, to name a few.
We re standing on a burning platform and it s triangular, shared Lord
Victor Adebowale, chairman of Social Enterprise UK board.

The community has to create a common understanding of our brand, and our
brand is about understanding society, Adebowale adds. We also need a
credible economic model. Although social enterprise plays a role, based
on the sector s best practices, it can drag the rest of business into
the future. Lastly, we can t expect politicians to understand or care
about this movement. We just need to understand why they don t. We have
to talk to people that don t agree with us -otherwise, we are working in
an echo chamber.

We must partner across the global social entrepreneurship sector, and
across all sectors (public, private and social) to create change. Simply
connecting the dots can have a massive impact.

- Scale

We see corporates playing a greater role in social enterprise. This is
the future. Responsible growth of corporate companies is the driving
force that can generate more entrepreneurs, generate more jobs, and
generate much more movement in society. - Dr. Ephrem Tekle Lemango,
Commissioner at Jobs Creation Commission, Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia, FDRE

When you gather over 1,000 players from the sector worldwide, it becomes
very evident that organisations are at varying stages of maturity. In
addition to capacity building, if we want to create real socioeconomic
impact, we need to invest in scalable solutions globally, affirms Yves
Moury, founder and CEO of Fundación Capital. The key to scalable
solutions is tech, tech, tech!

One way technology can help, is through corporate procurement. All
social enterprises rely on markets to drive revenues that enable them to
create social impact. Remember, social enterprise is a verb representing
business trying to deliver social value, shares Jonathan Coburn,
managing director, Social Enterprise Institute. We need to open markets
for activity to happen, creating an open social value marketplace.
Suppliers offer social value. Buyers use purchasing to create healthy
communities. There is a US$3 trillion B2B revenue opportunity ripe for
social enterprises to tap into.

However, technology isn t a silver bullet. You must consider supply-side
capability which scales both ways. An enterprise can t produce more than
the market demands. Vice versa, an enterprise shouldn t be limited if it
gets its big break. Ultimately, technology remains a key enabler to
scale though.

Visionary James Okina says you must ask yourself one question: How do
you scale hope? Our response: together.

- Cultural identity and progress

We re engraining local traditions with fresh perspectives. Gerry
Higgins, Founder, Social Enterprise World Forum

There is a phrase Laptops and Lederhosen coined by a German politician,
offered Ludwig Bayern, Founder and CEO, Learning Lions. Its meaning, not
dissimilar from the Forum s theme, underscores that cultural identity
and being on the forefront of innovation can go hand in hand. This topic
hits home for Bayern who, like many entrepreneurs, looks for ways to
foster economic growth in underserved, remote populations without
disrupting what makes these rural communities unique.

Living in a remote location like Turkana, Kenya, where we operate, does
not mean there is a lack of internet connectivity, added Bayern. People
there are completely connected to the web via mobile phones, and yet
they are not connected to the global workforce infrastructure. Mobile
and cloud technology can connect people to global markets that need
their skills.

In India, 70% of the population live in rural areas, adds Deirdre White,
CEO, PYXERA Global. The biggest sectors include agriculture and artisan
work. We must continue to support manual efforts and artisans and use
technology to help these individuals scale by giving them access to new
markets. Social entrepreneurs should also embrace technology as their
enabler to be change agents and create new markets.

Yash Ranga of Jaipur Rugs agrees, Technology isn t about changing the
industries people are in, but rather about empowering them to move up
the value chain by gaining access to a broader market of consumers.

Jaipur Rugs started in a tiny village in Rajasthan, India, and is now
known the world over for its inclusive carpet value chain that links
grassroots artisans with global markets.

Urbanisation is not the answer. Using technology infrastructure and
building digital skills to connect people wherever they are to global
markets, is.

The road to 2030

SAP can lead the way by bringing other corporations along with us, said
Alexandra van der Ploeg, Global Head of SAP Corporate Social
Responsibility. The world is looking to technology to help create
sustainable solutions that help the world run better and improve people
s lives. While technology cannot replace culture, capacity building, and
partnership, it can definitely accelerate impact.

You don t have to be a social entrepreneur to practice social
entrepreneurship. You need only understand the realities of the world we
live in. Find time to listen. Find champions who are already engaging on
the ground. There is so much change that can happen if individuals,
organisations and governments come together to identify solutions and
put them into practice together.

None of us will ever truly know the entire circumstances of the people
we are trying to help, shared Amonge Sinxoto, founder of Blackboard
Africa, but we must still engage.

Want to make better investment decisions? Look to AI

While $9.3 billion was invested in AI companies[1] in 2018, many VC
investors aren't leveraging that tech in their businesses. AI models are
especially beneficial tool for VC investors[2] because it can comb
through massive data sets and sort information to fuel better investment
decisions and higher ROI. Get The Full Ray Dalio Series in PDF Get the
entire 10-part series on Ray Dalio in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read
it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues Q4 2019 hedge fund
letters, conferences and more[3] In its purest form, AI is a method of
curve-fitting.

Imagine a random plot of points on a piece of paper and then ask
yourself, 'Which straight line most closely fits those points?' Instead,
we can envision a more complex version of that same diagram. Given a
random plot of red and green dots, can we draw a curve that will
separate the red dots from the green ones? Can we calculate a
mathematical equation for such a curve? If so, then we can predict the
color of a new (previously uncolored) dot using that equation. That's a
lot of mathematical jargon, so let's apply this theory to a real-life
situation: VC investing. In this case, the red dots represent failed
companies; the green ones are successful organizations. The goal is to
come up with the equation of a curve that separates the two so that you
can accurately categorize each new investment (or uncolored dot) as a
potential success or failure. Unlike the dots on a piece of paper,
however, we aren't confined to two dimensions. Instead, we must evaluate
startup characteristics using hundreds (sometimes thousands) of
variables. The problem becomes far more complex, but it's certainly
solvable with the help of modern AI technology.AI Modeling Takes More
Than a Good FaceThe challenge is identifying the dimensions necessary to
model the problem. Do they even exist? In venture capital, it's common
to look at founders' academic pedigrees, their past experiences and
successes, demonstrations of their entrepreneurial traits, and their
levels of passion. You should then look at market-specific conditions
like competition, pricing, product-market fit, traction, and so on. Some
of these dimensions are easier to model than others. For example, it's
mathematically easier to model entrepreneurs' alma maters and the
academic rigors of those schools than it is to track how passionate they
are about their products. Similarly, how do you model product-market fit
when buying decisions can be based on such nuanced factors as design,
aesthetics, speed, and features? Understandably, many VC investors might
be reluctant to embrace technology to help evaluate these dimensions to
make a decision. It can be difficult to alter your long-trusted
processes to fit modern conveniences. However, investors who rely on
antiquated processes will not see as much success in their investments
as those who embrace AI and other innovative technologies.Technology Is
Here to Help Rather Than HinderA lot of tenured VCs will tell you that
venture investing is more of an art than a science[4]. This may very
well be true given that more than 627,000 new businesses open each
year[5], and 70% of them usually fail[6] within five years. Sadly, no
scientific/mathematical solution can prevent failure. Still, it's
critical for VCs to shortlist potential candidates from the ever-growing
pool quickly — and the most efficient way to do this is with technology
like AI. Once you've done that, you can take a more 'artful' approach to
decision-making. Another clich associated with high-stakes
decision-making is to 'listen to your gut.' This gut instinct was once
thought to be what separated best-in-class decision makers from their
peers, but recent discoveries in neuroscience suggest[7] these gut
feelings are just our brains giving us a push in one direction based on
previous experiences. AI models, which are trained on historical data,
could behave similarly to 'gut instincts' — and that artificial instinct
would get better as it consumes more data. Finally, most everyone falls
into the trap of feeling threatened by technology[8]. After all, it's
common practice for businesses to replace blue-collar workers with
automation or retail tellers with self-serve machines. The obvious
logical next step would be to replace white-collar workers, right? This
fear is warranted in certain instances, as some jobs are threatened by
intelligent machines (think robo-advisors for investments[9].) It's not
hard to imagine a company like Crowdfundr building AI-based VCs that
investors can use to make smart investment decisions while bypassing the
venture capital community. The VC community could go from backing
disruption through AI to being hoisted by its own petard. That said, I
don't foresee a near future where technology takes over the jobs of
white-collar workers. Instead, I see innovative technologies — like AI —
becoming critical tools in decision makers' arsenals. Without these
tools, I imagine it will be hard for VC companies to thrive.The Future
of VC With AI Models at the HelmWe're far from the days of robo-partners
running VC firms, but we've reached the point that easy-to-model
dimensions can give us a glimpse of future possibilities. AI models can
analyze parameters like funding history, investor activity, and
sector-wise M&A data from sources such as Crunchbase, AngelList, and
PitchBook. We can then use the analyzed data to make better investment
predictions. Similarly, LinkedIn data related to founder and employee
background, headcount growth, key hires, and more can be used to
generate models around technological superiority and expected growth.
Additionally, web traffic data aggregators such as SimilarWeb and
SEMrush can be used to model traction in the market, traffic estimates,
monthly active users, growth rates, and so on. Finally, we can extract
customer sentiment from user comments posted via social media, online
discussions, and app store reviews. This wealth of data can be used as
dimensions to model startups. You can then use historical data to train
AI models, and eventually, use those models to predict the potential
outcome of new investment opportunities. There are many different ways
to use technology like AI to help you make better investment decisions.
As long as you embrace technology rather than shy away from it, you'll
gain a competitive edge and see greater ROI.About the Author Vikas

Sept. 30 -- Thales Group issued the following news release:

Thales has launched Season 3 of AI@Centech, a business accelerator
designed to help artificial-intelligence focused startups tackle
real-world problems.

Thales selected five international startups in early August out of a
pool of more than 200 potential competitors from around the world. The
search for qualified startups began in February when the program
published challenges ranging from how to more efficiently use AI to
manage satellites to applying augmented cognition to improve human
decision-making.

The selected startups will work closely with Thales business coaches and
AI experts who will advise them on critical skills such as fundraising,
product enhancement, design, visibility, proof-of-concept, and market
access.

Season 3 of AI@Centech follows last year's successful second season of
the program, which resulted in many achievements such as Thales and
MyDataModels winning a bid with the municipality of Nice Cte d'Azur,
France for underwater threat detection.

"We are very glad to open the 3rd season of AI@Centech, a key program to
fuel innovation working together with startups. Artificial Intelligence
is an essential asset woven into most of Thales' portfolio along with
connectivity, and cybersecurity," said Philippe Keryer, Executive
Vice-President, Strategy, Research and Technology. "Thales is working on
a TrUE AI: Transparent, Understandable and Ethical, making sure human
always remains in control. We are looking forward to discover
cutting-edge innovation among the five AI startups that will be
represented in this 3rd season and work together with them to deploy an
AI of trust."

About the Season 3 Startups:

* AIKO (Italy) uses AI software to filter out satellite data that is
unusable before it's transmitted to Earth.

* Amiral Technologies (France) created a predictive maintenance solution
that can predict failures in industrial internet of things (IIOT)
equipment without relying on historical data of failure. The startup
applies an AI algorithm using normal operation data to inform the
operator when abnormal operation occurs.

* Satavia (UK) created a solution for eco-conscious aircraft operators,
the patented DECISIONX:NETZERO technology, which enables smarter flight
planning and air traffic management to prevent aircraft contrails and
quantify climate benefit.

* SenX (France) offers an open source development platform to manage
sensors that gather and track geo-located, time series data.

* The Edge Company (Italy) uses a computer vision technology to
recognize types of bird species that pose a risk to aircraft during
take-off and landing and launches a species-specific distress call to
disperse them.

Thales is also launching a new program, Synergy, powered by AI@Centech,
to get advanced technology to market faster by leveraging the power of
Canadian SMBs. Thales selected Pegasus Imagery for its robust
data-focused capabilities and development of advanced UAVs and sensor
integration and TerraSense, which fuses different types of data such as
drone camera footage or satellite images to detect and recognize
targets, as the inaugural Synergy participants as part of Season 3 of
AI@Centech.

7 Important things to know before venturing into your own business

Business Today Online

According to the Economic Survey 2019-20, from 70,000 new firms created
in 2014, the Indian entrepreneurial market witnessed a phenomenal growth
of 80%, reaching up to 1,24,000 new firms in 2018.  Even though these
impressive stats prove the new-age dawn, it is also true that
entrepreneurship can be a challenging game - a high risk, high reward
path for which no amount of school and college experience can prepare
you.  Combined with constant nagging, stressful and overwhelming
feelings, a startup owner often juggles with zillion things, all at the
same time.  Also Read: 

Grab opportunity created by closure of plants in China: MSME minister to
entrepreneurs

There's no avoiding this reality for new startup founders, but it's
possible to manage expectations and take actions with a sense of purpose
toward building your startup with a bit of planning.     Against this
backdrop, here we have listed seven key things that everyone must know
before venturing into the vast world of innovation and entrepreneurship:
   

1. Is entrepreneurship the right fit for you? 

  It is vital to know whether entrepreneurship is your cup of tea or
not. If you are simply venturing into this world because it is the
latest trend, then your business plan might flop before you even begin.
Entrepreneurship will dominate a significant part of your life.  If you
aren't ready to take this responsibility in the long run, then you are
only bringing frustration, dissatisfaction, and loads of stress into
your life. Starting your business is as good as having a newborn baby. 
You've to take care of it day and night, nurture it with love and
sleepless nights. And just like a child, despite all the good parenting
and hard work, you will never know how it's going to turn in the end,
but you'll still support it.     

2. Evaluate the pros and cons of your business venture 

   Optimism is great. It keeps you positive, confident, and cheerful
while starting and even conducting your business. However, when it comes
to a business venture and evaluating the risks and rewards, staying
positively realistic is better.  Ensure that your startup idea is
scalable or not. Is it solving contemporary challenges? Is it an
exclusive solution, or do you have competitors? As a startup owner,
you'll have to think about all hard-hitting questions before turning
your idea into a full-fledged reality.      Most importantly, be honest
with yourself. Don't let yourself be caught in the trap of wishful
thinking and focus on the existing facts and metrics of the target
market.  Carefully navigate through all pain points, including financial
parameters, future possibilities, and worse case scenarios, and check
whether your business idea is suitable for your target market base.

3. Know your customer 

   In the business world, customers are the key that can break or make
your business. Before diving into the vast world of new firms, conduct a
thorough market and consumer research. Understand the key demographics
about your potential customers and find out what the most attractive
segment of your business-- something consumers are looking forward to. 
This step will help you identify the primary USPs of your venture and
help gain maximum traction. This will also exponentially increase the
success rate of your business because once you get to know the customer,
you've already won half the battle.     

4. Take risks, but smartly 

   All that glitters is not gold. Similarly, every risky move doesn't
necessarily mean an opportunity for high rewards. Usually, motivation
sessions are filled with punch lines like 'take risks', but is taking
blind risks without carefully navigating the advantages and
disadvantages a good idea? Absolutely not.  While starting a business,
it is essential to take calculated risks, but more importantly, it is
crucial to know when not to take risks.  While taking a risk-laced step,
make sure you're capable of handling the outcome if things go south.
Taking a risk and making a mistake might not halt your entrepreneurial
journey, but taking an ignorant one will definitely take you down.     

5. Passion can open many doors 

   Not many people can reach the peak, fewer can stay there. Similarly,
not everyone can be a founder of a successful business because it's a
lonely journey.  The beginning of a startup is almost always filled with
unforeseeable difficulties, setbacks, and little positive light. It is
ultimately your inner passion that can motivate you to continue going
forward.   It is the only thing that will give you the power to face all
possible obstacles and find innovative ways to navigate through the
toughest of black holes. An entrepreneur is by default a passionate and
driven person because, without it, they are just another mediocre human
being running the superficial rat race.     

6. The network is equal to Net-worth 

   The business community is a close-knit one. Here you need people who
understand perspective, your ambition, your drive and help you push
boundaries.  While entering the business world, make sure you surround
yourself with more competent, skilled, knowledgeable, and experienced
people because, in business, continuous evolution is the only way to
survive.  So keep learning, taking suggestions, discussing future
possibilities, and constructing a solid foundation for your future
growth   

7. Airy entitlement is a shortcut for failure 

   As a startup founder, you may end up doing even the most basic jobs.
For instance, one of the world's richest men and Amazon's Co-founder
Jeff Bezos used to deliver orders himself in the initial days of his
startup venture.  Today, as of October 2021, Amazon is worth
approximately $1.7 trillion. This just proves that if you are sure about
your startup idea, you'll do all tasks and get the job done. Initially,
you will have to make sacrifices, given your sweat and blood
(literally), but gradually there will come a time when you'll start
gaining rewards.  Therefore, stay humble during hard times and not
become entitled or feel that a task is too trivial or unimportant for a
startup founder.     

Take intelligent and incremental steps 

  Founding your startup and starting a business is an exciting concept,
but only a few people have the heart, mind, and patience to make it to
the top.  Do your homework, understand the market nuances, take
calculated and well-thought risks, leverage the tremendous experience
and in-depth knowledge of your network, build a strong team, believe in
yourself and your product, and take one step at a time, success will
definitely knock on your doors.

Modular startup raises $38M, says it's "the opposite of Katerra"

July 14 -- Assembly OSM, a modular construction startup that has
compared its process to putting together Ikea furniture, raised $38
million in Series A funding.

The company was founded in 2019 by twin brothers Bill and Chris
Sharples, principals of Manhattan-based SHoP Architects. Assembly calls
its construction method "post-modular" because it is more akin to a car
or aircraft assembly line than a traditional modular build-out, where
the structure is put together on a single factory floor.

 

Assembly instead spreads construction across a vast network of suppliers
and manufacturers - an approach that "constrains" the process but allows
for more freedom in design, CEO Andrew Staniforth said.

The startup has now raised more than $60 million. Fifth Wall's climate
tech fund and Bessemer Venture Partners' Rob Stavis led the latest
round, with participation from the Jefferies Group, Manta Ray Ventures,
FJ Labs, RSE, Signia, Gaingels, New Vista Capital, Tectonic, Atento,
Etan Fraser and Moving Capital.

 

The Fifth Wall fund is "dedicated to decarbonizing the built environment
and the global real estate industry." Assembly claims that its buildings
can have 30 to 40 percent less embodied carbon than traditional ones and
that its construction sites cut emissions by 60 to 70 percent.

The allure of modular construction is relocating much of the building
process to an indoor, controlled environment with a consistent
workforce. But as a relatively young industry, it is far from being
perfected.

Many firms are trying to work out the kinks of modular construction.
Assembly, which is doing feasibility work in New York, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, St. Louis and other cities, is no stranger to setbacks. It
had been planning four Manhattan buildings with 800 apartments, but
Staniforth said these were feasibility studies for projects that
Assembly ultimately did not pursue because of the pandemic and other
factors.

 

Staniforth worked at Forest City Ratner Companies when the firm was
building its ballyhooed B2 project, a 32-story modular tower, only to
see it bogged down by litigation, cost overruns and leaks. He said
Assembly's people can assure developers and investors that they "know
what went wrong on that project."

"It is a big, important statement that we can make because we lived
through that project," he said.

 

The highly publicized failure of another modular startup, Katerra, which
filed for bankruptcy last year, has not discouraged Assembly. Staniforth
said one of the easiest ways to combat the "Katerra stigma" is to point
out to developers and investors that Assembly's approach is "the exact
opposite."

Katerra had a vertically integrated business model, setting out to
control every aspect of the construction process by acquiring
architecture, engineering and construction management firms and by
opening its own factories.

The approach required massive infusions of capital, was wracked by
delays and proved unsustainable.

"In our world, we have redundancy," Staniforth. "We have multiple
suppliers for each of the components."

Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes testifies in her own criminal trial

Greentechlead.com

December 2, 2021 Thursday

Body

December 02 -- One of the biggest mysteries in former Theranos founder
and CEO Elizabeth Holmes' high-profile fraud trial was whether or not
she would testify. So it was a shock late Friday afternoon when the
Stanford dropout took the stand, 11 weeks after the trial began. Now
that the prosecution has rested its case - questioning witnesses like
former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, whistleblower Erika
Cheung, Theranos patients, investors, medical professionals and
journalists - Holmes is telling her side of the story under oath, her
defense aiming to build the case that she did not knowingly defraud her
investors.

The former Silicon Valley hotshot faces two counts of conspiracy to
commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. If convicted, each
count could land her up to 20 years in prison.

So far, Holmes has stuck to her argument that while Theranos made
errors, the startup's failure wasn't fraud. She claims that when she
told stakeholders about the capabilities of Theranos' technology, she
was conveying what she thought was the truth. Since Holmes isn't a
trained scientist, she says she listened to the guidance of the experts
she hired - she even testified that scientists and engineers designed a
slide deck presented to investors.

 

Holmes' defense has produced emails from high-ranking lab officials like
chief scientist Ian Gibbons, who said that Theranos machines had
"demonstrated capabilities fully equivalent to lab methods in areas
where we have done assay development." Holmes testified that Gibbons'
emails indicated that Theranos' 4.0 Edison machine "could run any test,"
per live courtroom reporting from Law 360's Dorothy Atkins (the trial is
not livestreamed). Gibbons died by suicide in 2013 while employed at
Theranos, days before he was to be summoned to appear in court about a
Theranos-related patent dispute.

Holmes has also denied that she was trying to lead Walgreens astray by
sending the company documents with the unauthorized use of Pfizer's
logo. She said in court that she wishes she had handled the situation
differently, but that she had included the Pfizer logo because Theranos
had done some testing with Pfizer before they decided not to work
together. Her defense also pulled up a study from Johns Hopkins
University from around the same time, which called the Theranos
technology "novel and sound."

This is a direct response to a key claim from the prosecution,
which produced evidence that Holmes sent Walgreens a document in 2010
called "Pfizer Theranos System Validation Final Report." As it turned
out, this document was created by Theranos staff, not Pfizer. Yet
Pfizer's logo appeared prominently in the document, which indicated that
the pharmaceutical giant endorsed Theranos' technology. Theranos entered
into deals with Walgreens and Safeway that year. But in court, a Pfizer
scientist denied that Pfizer endorsed Theranos, adding that no employees
approved the document she sent while in talks about the deal. Pfizer had
looked into Theranos' technology in 2008, but chose not to invest in the
company.

Holmes has also begun discussing her relationship with the Theranos
board, who were paid $150,000 per year and given half a million shares
for their role - former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was paid
$500,000 per year as a consultant. So far, it seems Holmes is trying to
characterize the board as being knowledgeable enough about the nature of
the company to make an informed investment in the company. Multiple
courtroom reporters have noted that Holmes is deploying corporate and
scientific jargon in her testimony.

 

Elizabeth Holmes built Theranos with a heartfelt pitch that raised
enough capital from high-profile investors to reach a $10 billion
valuation. With just a needle prick of blood, her technology would run
dozens of blood tests to detect disease quicker, and at a lower cost.
She famously repeated the line: "I hope that less people will have to
say goodbye too soon to people that they love."

But, as we now know - and as you can now learn about through tell-all
HBO documentaries and investigative nonfiction books - the technology
didn't work, and the company appeared to continue testing patients'
blood despite knowing they couldn't deliver accurate medical
information. Her criminal trial began in early September in San Jose,
California - after delays due to the pandemic and Holmes' childbirth -
with Judge Edward Davila at the bench.

In her heyday, when Forbes named her the youngest and wealthiest female
self-made billionaire in America, she was portrayed as a Steve Jobs-like
genius with unstoppable charisma. But in court filings, Holmes' defense
said that Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani, her former boyfriend and COO of
Theranos, was abusive and controlling. The filings indicate that Holmes'
lawyers might introduce testimony on Holmes' mental health and the
effects of the abuse as part of her defense, perhaps pinning the blame
of Theranos' failure on Balwani, who will be tried for fraud separately
next year.

But as Holmes has testified the last few days, the San Jose courthouse
has looked more like a circus than the site of a criminal fraud case.
Law360 reporter Dorothy Atkins tweeted this morning that when she
arrived at 4:30 AM, she was the 32nd person in line to enter the
courthouse. Due to the popularity of the case, audience members have
been urged to only take notes or live-report using silent keyboards,
like touch screens on a smartphone. Some journalists have brought tarot
cards to give readings while waiting hours in line. The fanfare is
reminiscent of the early days of the trial in September, when fans (yes,
fans) of the disgraced entrepreneur cosplayed as Elizabeth Holmes. As a
play on that viral moment, artist Danielle Baskin - who often pokes fun
at Silicon Valley culture - sold blonde wigs, black turtlenecks,
lipstick and blood energy drinks in line this morning (she later tweeted
that she learned today that you can't "sell merch" on federal property.)

 

 

Though Elizabeth Holmes makes for an easy Halloween costume, the antics
around the high-profile case can't undermine the horrifying evidence
presented by the prosecution, which is working to prove to the jury that
Holmes knowingly defrauded investors by lying about the efficacy of
Theranos products.

One former Theranos patient, Erin Tompkins, testified in court that her
Theranos test results detected the presence of HIV antibodies, which
could mean she had the virus that causes AIDS, a life-threatening
disease. Tompkins said she didn't have insurance at the time, so it
wasn't until three months later that she could get a blood test
elsewhere, which did not detect HIV. She said she was initially drawn to
Theranos since the prices were so low. Another patient, Dr. Mehrl
Ellsworth, testified that he received inaccurate results, which falsely
indicated that he had prostate cancer.

Dr. Adam Rosendorff, the former Theranos lab director, testified that
"the company was more about PR and fundraising than patient care,"
adding that Holmes went ahead with Theranos' commercial launch despite
his concerns about the technology. One of the Theranos whistleblowers,
Erika Cheung, recounted her story of quitting the startup because she
was uncomfortable processing patient samples when she didn't think the
technology could provide accurate results.

After court adjourns today, the trial will take a break for the
Thanksgiving holiday, resuming Holmes' testimony on Monday. According to
court schedules, her defense is expected to continue presenting its case
through the middle of December.

2.4k new-age tech cos wound up biz in 2022

MINT

NEW DELHI, Dec. 29 -- Indian startups faced a challenging year, with
2,404 of them shuttering in 2022, more than double the 1,012 that had
shut shop in the previous year, according to data from Traxcn.

About 266 startups that shut down this year were funded by venture
capital, angel investors, family offices or institutional investors. The
companies had raised close to $290 million, the data showed.

The number of startups shutting down in 2022 is also higher than in the
previous two years, indicating that it has been difficult for these
companies to stay afloat as investors become more cautious amid global
economic uncertainties. Only 2018 saw more startup failures in the past
five years, with 3,484 closures.

"Startup investments in 2021 were exuberant, with new financing records
being set in practically every industry. 2022 tempered the investor
mood, and founder expectations, resulting in the gain of the overall
ecosystem," said Manu Rikhye, a partner at Merak Ventures.

Edtech was among the hardest-hit segments in the Indian startup
ecosystem, with 25 funded startups in this sector closing their doors.
Funding for edtech companies in India plummeted to $2.4 billion in 2022,
down from $4.1 billion in the previous year, according to Tracxn. Among
notable edtech companies that wound up in 2022 were Lido Learning,
Udayy, SuperLearn, and Crejo.fun. The closure of Lido Learning, which
had raised $20 million in funding, resulted in the loss of over 1,200
jobs.

Edtech startup Udayy shut down in June after exploring options such as
pivoting to a different business model and even attempting to sell the
company. The company employed around 100 people.

The e-commerce segment in India was also impacted in 2022, with close to
50 funded startups failing to survive the so-called funding winter.
Among these companies, e-commerce enablement platform ShopX had raised
the most funding at $50 million but ultimately filed for insolvency
after defaulting on its interest payments.

Another e-commerce startup that shuttered its doors in the segment is
business-in-a-box platform Protonnm, which shut shop within close to six
months after raising Rs.67 crore in a seed round led by Matrix Partners
in July.

Many other e-commerce startups that shuttered were still in their early
stages, including Accel-backed Shopmonk and Axilor Ventures-backed
Inroadz.

Capital raised by Indian startups fell by 39% to $25.4 billion in 2022
from $41.8 billion the year before, Traxcn said.

For raising cash, many startups tapped venture debt while a few others
opted for flat rounds to stay afloat. "Businesses that had a mandate for
growth without considering unit economics took a beating," Brijesh
Damodaran, co-founder and chief investment officer of Auxano Capital,
said.

However, the funding crunch not only impacted edtech and e-commerce
firms, but also healthtech, media and fintech.

The healthtech and media sectors faced challenges in 2022, with
approximately 26 and 24 funded companies shutting down, respectively.
The fintech segment also saw 26 startups fail to make it to 2023.

These shutdowns also resulted in widespread layoffs. Nearly 19,000
employees across the tech ecosystem were laid off in 2022, Mint
reported. A significant portion of those impacted was from edtech
startups.

'IT sector exports to witness 8-10% growth in FY 2022-23'

The Times of India (TOI)

May 2, 2022 Monday

Section: CHANDIGARH

Length: 960 words

Byline: Sanjeev Verma

Body

The director general of the Software Technology Park of India (STPI),
Arvind Kumar, tells TOI's Sanjeev Verma that right problem statement,
right solution, right business model and right mentorship are required
to save startups from failure. He says software product development
requires longer mentorship and longer patience as compared to service
providers.What is the reason that nearly 90% of the startups in India
fail in the first five years of their inception? Let us understand why
any business fails. Lack of sustainable revenue after a few years of
investment, without clear sight of breakeven, is why people close
businesses.

In startups, risks associated are plenty and so are gains. Inablity to
understand risks and challenges thoroughly or mitigate them in time, is
often the reason why some startups are not as successful as others.
There are few requirements for a successful startup. First, do you have
the right problem statement? If the problem statement is coming from the
industry, it knows what is required and chances of success are more.
Second, do you have got the right solution? Right product-market fit,
right business model, right understanding of what customers really want
and would pay for, availability of funds at the right time and most
importantly, whether you have got the right mentorship? For a year and
half, there has been a good startup ecosystem in the country because
before that nobody knew about mentorship, bootcamps and so many other
things. Generally, people who have startup ideas are so excited that
they do not seek inputs and validation at opportune time. Therefore,
they may fail and this phenomenon is there all over the world.What
challenges are we facing in creating the ecosystem for making more
startups successful, especially in creating more product development
opportunities rather than just focusing on service providers? When you
say service, it is early and time-bound money. When it is a product,
gestation period is longer. You also have to create intellectual
property rights (IPRs) for differentiation. We have created such an
ecosystem in the country that people are looking for IPR. Otherwise,
nobody used to bother. Last quarter's data says IPR applications filed
by Indian companies are now more than non-Indian companies. The product
requires quality mentorship and longer patience. STPI has developed 20
Centres for Entrepreneurship (CoEs) in various domains, like in FinTech
we have FinBlue in Chennai, in automotive we have Motion in Pune, and we
have artificial intelligence and data analytics in Mohali. These
domain-specific CoEs have created an enabling ecosystem to bring
catalytic support and facilitate innovation-led development for
differentiated products or solutions backed by IPRs, so that software
product development too gets the necessary push. We are also focusing on
software products through the Next Generation Incubation Scheme (NGIS)
in Tier-II cities. As their gestation period is longer, the results are
yet to come. What is your vision as the STPI director general?I want IT
industry to grow in Tier II and III, or emerging cities. Like the IT and
ITES industry, we want success in software product industry and want to
become a world leader in it. We want to create a conducive environment
for software product sectors.In FY 2021-22, IT exports from tricity
(Mohali, Chandigarh and Panchkula) were nearly worth Rs 6,000 crore,
including STP units and SEZ units. What is the target for FY
2022-23?Tricity is an emerging hub, though earlier governments might not
have given required attention. For three-four years, in the software
industry, we were able to see an 8-10% growth depending on the city.
During the pandemic, we maintained the 8-10% growth. We will continue to
have this growth even in the next financial year across all our
centres.Though Mohali largely has the infrastructure and support
mechanism, what stops companies from investing in it? Why can't Mohali
compete with Gurugram, Noida or Hyderabad, especially in IT and ITES
sector?Gurugram, Noida, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai are established
hubs. They started attracting investment 20 years earlier and are
basically Tier I cities. Mohali did not focus on investment at the time.
Now, it is coming up as an emerging hub and we have seen a lot of new
investment in it. It is likely Mohali will see growth in investment in
IT and ITES sector. How has been the response for India BPO Promotion
Scheme? How many seats have been allocated to Chandigarh, Mohali and
Panchkula so far? Nearly 2,600 seats have been allocated to the
tricity - Mohali, Chandigarh and Panchkula - in this scheme. This scheme
is one of the most successful schemes and has created around 50,000 real
employment (jobs) across the country. If you go to small cities, you
will find people have created small BPOs and there is a good response
from the tricity, especially Mohali. We are hopeful the government will
continue with this scheme. What response have you got for the NEURON CoE
in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, set up at the STPI
Incubation Centre in Mohali? This has been our flagship CoE in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Data Analytics, Internet of Things (IoT)
and Audio-Visual Gaming (AVG), and we have got a very good response.
Artificial intelligence and big data analytics are the future of the
digital economy. Four startups in CoEs have already got funds from NGIS.
There are a total of 23 startups onboard in NEURON. We have
state-of-the-art infrastructure with dedicated labs in the area of
artificial intelligence and IoT in this centre.How many units from
tricity have been registered under STPI Mohali?We have 145 units

Marketing Needs Big Changes? Think Small.

August 11 -- Clients are talking to us about marketing transformation,
reimagining everything from organizational structure and operational
capabilities to digital dexterity and brand strategy. At a time when
marketing budgets are under increased scrutiny, there is a new mandate
for CMOs to prove the value of marketing to the rest of the organization
and provide greater transparency into the inner workings of their
function.

This calls for a sea change in the way that enterprise CMOs see
themselves and their teams. If marketing has ever existed in isolation,
that time has long passed. Silos are breaking down, and the CFO is
knocking at the door wondering where the budget went.

As responsibilities shift for defining business models, driving
innovation initiatives, and testing new routes to market, enterprise
CMOs must learn from the CMOs of smaller, more agile organizations.

Startup CMOs are the tip of the spear, directing go-to-market and
overall business strategy for their organizations. They are responsible
for fueling demand, outpacing the competition, and realizing exponential
growth. They are used to working without a net in dynamic environments
with limited resources but unlimited pressure.

Marketing leaders forged in the crucible of the startup have developed
unique mindsets out of necessity that set them apart from their
enterprise counterparts. They've figured out not only how to do more
with less, but do it faster and better. Learn how to think like a
startup CMO to accelerate innovation and execution, while inspiring your
team to be more adaptable and resilient.

Be the CustomerStartup CMOs own the customer journey from acquisition to
advocacy. Stop thinking that your job ends with sales or support.
Instead, make it your mission to take every prospect on the path to
becoming an evangelist by creating desire and delight every step of the
way.

Start by building a customer-centric culture within marketing, then
share the love with the rest of the organization. Putting the needs of
the customer first should never be controversial, so bring in the voice
of the customer to provide clarity, resolve disputes, and direct
strategy.

Romance the NewLike it or not, marketing owns the vision of the future
for the company. Knowing what customers want next is a necessity of the
role. Startup CMOs embrace playing soothsayer, leaning into market
trends and innovations, to stay one step ahead of the competition.
Taking risks and betting big on what the future will look like is how
startups disrupt entire industries.

Whether or not you own innovation outright, bringing an innovative,
forward-looking mindset to your organization can help you not only see
where your company or industry is heading, but provides a clearer lens
on where you are now and what you need to do to improve.

Fail ForwardFor many execs, fail is a four-letter word that they've
banished from their vocabularies. Startup CMOs embrace failure as a
necessity. Taking a test-and-learn, agile approach means that you not
only fail fast, but you also learn from your mistakes. When you approach
each new initiative as an opportunity to challenge the status quo, you
move from reactive to proactive and create an environment where change
is expected, not dreaded.

Continuous improvement depends on a cycle of feedback and adjustment.
When you closely align strategy and execution, they become a virtuous
flywheel. Just make sure you have the correct measurements in place to
derive insights from test data. Taking a data-driven approach reduces
the likelihood of friction and fiefdoms.

Exploit Every AdvantageStartup CMOs are definitionally underdogs, so
they must try to create unnatural advantages wherever possible. Staying
on the cutting edge of new technologies and approaches that slow-moving
competitors miss is part of the playbook. They need to find ways to
improve efficiency and effectiveness quickly, often with limited
resources. So judicious investments into marketing technology, data and
analytics, and business process management help them find ways to
automate, accelerate, and streamline their operations.

Without time or money to waste, startup CMOs rely on the test-and-learn
approach, insisting on proof-of-concept trials and ruthlessly cutting
tools, technologies, and vendors that don't perform. Bringing that same
mindset to your marketing operations will help ensure your function is
fully optimized.

Do it YourselfStartup CMOs are hands-on, almost to a fault. When there
are gaps in capabilities, they have to step in to get the job done.
Cleaning the break room fridge aside, startup CMOs are used to rolling
up their sleeves when there's no one to delegate to.

They often have centralized organizational structures with clear
functional alignment, do what they can in-house rather than relying on
agencies for critical functions, and hire broad generalists who can go
deep in a couple of areas. Embracing the DIY mentality can help you take
a critical look at how your team is structured and what value you're
truly getting from your agencies, services, and vendors.

Don't HideIn a startup, there's nowhere to hide. Startup CMOs have to
collaborate with and justify their decisions to product, sales, IT, and
finance. They value transparency and show their CEOs, peers, board
members, and investors exactly where investments are going and what
business outcomes they produce. Startup CMOs celebrate wins and learn
from losses as a team. They communicate clearly so that the whole
organization understands the value they create.

Don't be afraid to take the same approach no matter how large, complex,
or slow-moving your organization may be. Being a change agent takes
courage, but it pays dividends.

marketing transformation initiatives.

This Austin accelerator made big claims; employees and customers say it
didn't deliver

Newchip, an online accelerator promising to help startups, has filed for
bankruptcy and is now facing insolvency amid employee and client
discontent. Dozens of employees of the troubled organization staged a
walkout on May 4, demanding that founder Andrew Ryan step down as CEO.
Ryan - who previously went by the name of Ryan Rafols - started
Austin-based Newchip in 2016 after spending more than seven years as a
city commissioner in Austin, according to his LinkedIn profile.  Newchip
initially started out, according to Silicon Hills News, "as an
aggregator of top deals from various equity-based crowdfunding
platforms," and later evolved into its current accelerator model. In his
LinkedIn profile, Ryan describes Newchip as an entity that provides
"entrepreneurs with all of the skills and tools necessary to build,
scale, and fund their startups from launch to exit" via its "online
global accelerator and venture fund." Essentially, Newchip presented
itself as an accelerator that would help startups meet and raise money
from investors and grow their companies for a fee.

But the accelerator failed to deliver on a number of its promises, some
employees say, and left hanging founders who had signed up. Some
founders argued, in interviews with TechCrunch and in at least one
public post discussion on LinkedIn, that Newchip's fee - which varied
from a few thousand dollars to up to $18,000 or $20,000 - was too high
and not worth the services provided. Some insisted that it was difficult
to impossible to get a refund when the accelerator did not follow
through. Chief among the long list of complaints by eight former
employees who walked out and were interviewed by TechCrunch is
"mismanagement" on Ryan's part. The executive, they claimed, regularly
was aggressive toward individuals in the company via written and verbal
communications, and made poor decisions regarding leadership roles.  One
former employee who wished to remain anonymous told TechCrunch: "He
would routinely often hire either naïve or 'yes man' type employees and
get absolutely ruthless and degrading and demeaning to people while
saying things like 'I'm too good to be wasting my brilliance on this'
and just scream at people." In response as to whether he was demeaning
to employees, Ryan acknowledged that his leadership style was based on
"a military mindset" and that "there have been moments where the line
between accountability and conflict has blurred." He also admitted that
in one particular instance, he could see how his reaction "might have
come across as demeaning." Ryan also added that he's been "known to walk
out of or abruptly end meetings lacking an agenda, emphasizing the
importance of preparation." In a Zoom interview with TechCrunch and in
two different LinkedIn posts (which can be found here and here), Ryan
largely blamed the macro environment, managers and employees for the
company's demise. Via email, Ryan said he ultimately accepted "full
responsibility for the events at Newchip." He claimed to currently be
"in discussions with numerous VC firms, family offices, and PE firms to
formulate a continuity plan." Newchip, operating under Astralabs, filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, revealing that it had just $1.7
million in assets compared to $4.8 million in liabilities. Last week, a
bankruptcy judge ended up converting the case to Chapter 7 liquidation.
This is unsurprising, considering that, according to Silicon Hills News:
"While Newchip raised $7.9 million from accredited and nonaccredited
investors, Crunchbase data reveals a troubling history of financial
losses. SEC filings show a net loss of $197,884 for 2016, a $748,999
loss in 2017, and the company claimed $4.5 million in tax loss
carryforwards in its 2020 financial statements." Ryan claimed the
employees staged the recent walkout to protest the fact that the company
was going to be laying off more employees, and were led by a Newchip
investor. While Ryan did not name the investor, that individual is
believed to be Joe Merrill, who also served as chief of Newchip's board.
(TechCrunch reached out to Merrill but he did not respond to requests
for comment.) Ryan added that the accelerator had already conducted
several rounds of layoffs over the previous six months, going from more
than 200 employees to about 75 at the beginning of this month. Speaking
to TechCrunch, Ryan said: "We had to make cuts across the team and there
was gonna be massive layoffs [...] Otherwise there would be no money to
pay people and we had to cut the business down. And while I requested
approval from the court to take on capital and we had investors ready to
give us capital, our attorneys had failed to file the motion. And so we
basically pushed them to file for [an] emergency filing." He claimed
that employees were not happy with that move and demanded that he "wind
the company down and basically liquidate everything," which he said he
could not do while in Chapter 11 proceedings. Ryan said he went on to
terminate the board. For their part, the eight former employees
TechCrunch spoke with deny walking out due to potentially being laid off
or not getting paid and instead cite Ryan's "lack of leadership and
mismanagement." In their walkout letter (which was shared with
TechCrunch), the employees wrote of their concerns over the dismissals
of "key personnel," saying their "removal has led to an erosion of trust
and morale within the organization, creating a toxic work environment."
The employees demanded the execs be reinstated and that Ryan step down
as CEO "effective immediately."  No one was reinstated. Via email, Ryan
told TechCrunch: "In the end, we were unfortunately compelled to close
the company despite having secured capital commitments to keep it moving
forward due to the takeover attempt and false allegations made to the
court that we could be liquidated for half a billion dollars if the
court just signed off, which understandably led to frustration right now
and a lot of our 1,200 active companies are rightfully upset. I
empathize deeply with everyone affected and am taking every possible
measure to rectify the situation." He also said the company would "be
bringing in a new, more experienced CEO." It isn't just employees who
say they were burned by Newchip. Andrew Goei, founder of PitchPages, a
pitch deck and fundraising software startup, said he wanted a refund a
few months into the program after he felt he was not getting the
promised services, specifically the investor intros.  In an interview
with TechCrunch, Goei recalled Newchip's salespeople telling him the
accelerator "has this huge network and can introduce us to all these
investors." PitchPages would pay $8,000, and if the company didn't get
successful funding, the company would get its money back, Goei said. So
his company signed up in August of that year. "About two or three weeks
into it, we still had no communication from them at all, even though we
paid," Goei said. At that point, PitchPages had paid about $6,000 to the
program. During that time, Goei said he met two mentors from the program
who voiced concerns about Newchip and recommended Goei get a refund.
Weeks would go by before customer support people would respond, and
ultimately he was told there would be no refund, Goei told us.  "It was
very apparent that their whole model was 'get as many startups as we
can. We don't care who they are. We don't care what stage they're in as
long as they pay, that's all that matters,'" Goei said. "And they would
find any way possible and not give any refunds. What  was really sad
about the whole thing is that Newchip was started by this guy who comes
from the VC community."  Founder Orri Bogdan, too, told TechCrunch that
Newchip's salespeople told him that they would offer a full refund if he
failed to raise funding through the outfit, but then "snuck in extreme
stipulations with the intention of never refunding anyone."  The founder
of VAE Labs, which is developing an edible energy spray, Bogdan says
that as a result of Newchip's terms, his startup declined its offer to
"accept" his company in favor of joining a different accelerator. "If we
hadn't gotten into DSHA, we would have definitely accepted and lost
$7,500 to $18,000, with the higher price depending on if we accepted
their $250,000 warrant or not," Bogdan said.  Former Newchip employees
told TechCrunch that the company "rarely issued refunds." They also
claimed that the company paid customers to remove negative reviews. Ryan
disputes both of those claims. He said it was stated in the customer
contract that refunds were not given, for example, when companies
folded. He also said that it was "a very common practice" for customers
to use negative reviews to try and get a refund. "They don't qualify for
refunds, so they leave a review and they email you back and say 'Hey,
give me my refund and I'll take this down,'" Ryan said. "We gave about
$150,000 in refunds a month. For a business that brings in about a
million dollars in tax, that's a significant amount  - that's about
three times the amount that you'd see in any case." Ryan also said he
"tried to train some of the low-level marketing people" to keep up with
positive review management, but that they "would often fail to do that."
Via email, Ryan also claimed that Newchip "lost money on nearly each and
every admission" to its programs "due to the high risk and failure of
startups."  Though the employee group has more recently gone public with
their grievances, they make claims of mismanagement going back years,
including the clawback of sales commissions and Ryan giving himself
bonuses during monthly financial deficits. For example, the group said
sales commissions were awarded when a contract was instituted, but
allege that later they were removed for what they were told were
unsigned contracts, even though the customer was actively paying. Ryan
disputes that allegation, telling TechCrunch that 200 to 300 contracts
weren't signed, amounting to around $1 million, and that he found out
some team members were "lying to clients" and charging accounts anyway.
"We strictly adhered to the principle of paying admissions commissions
only after contracts were signed to our knowledge. Unfortunately, in Q4
of the previous year, we discovered instances of non-compliance within
our admissions team concentrated in a handful of individuals making up
about 10% of our team," Ryan said via email. At that time, the employee
group says Ryan made himself head of sales. When asked if that was
accurate, Ryan confirmed, though he said it was temporary while the
company sought a replacement. Ryan also told TechCrunch via email that
his first year "to receive pay over $75k since 2016" was in 2020, when
he received $92,000, and in 2021 it was $175,000 and in 2022, $287,000,
"equating to approximately 1.4% of revenue." He added that "about a
third of amounts yearly were performance-based bonuses." At the time of
writing, it remained unclear as to what would happen to the
entrepreneurs participating in the program, the remainder of employees
and the company itself. The group of former employees said they are
reaching out to other accelerators and to the startup ecosystem to see
if they can assist the founders affected by the liquidation. Ryan said
he was "in search of a white knight" to support the company and take
over its programs.

Tamil Nadu unveils startup policy to create one lakh jobs by 2023;
proposes Rs 250 Cr startup fund

Tamil Nadu has joined the states that have a Startup Policy. Its policy
aims to encourage innovation and boost the creation of jobs through
entrepreneurial activities.

After brainstorming for about a year, the Tamil Nadu government has
unveiled its startup and innovation policy that looks to create one lakh
jobs, both direct and indirect over the next few years.

The state is also planning to set up the Tamil Nadu Startup Fund of
Funds to the tune of Rs 250 crore, which will be registered as an
Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), and managed by organisations like the
Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to invest in startups
and MSMEs. The government announced it will invest Rs 75 crore in the
fund and the first tranche of Rs 25 crore will be allotted in FY20. The
state startup policy was unveiled by Chief Minister K Palaniswami
recently.

Apart from this, the state will also set up Tamil Nadu Startup Seed
Grant Fund (TNSSGF) of Rs 50 crore, with an allotment of Rs 5 crore in
the first year. This will be created in partnership with financial
institutions and universities to support early-stage startups with their
financing requirements in the form of grants to help them with research
and innovation, the policy document said.

Explaining the state's startup policy, R V Shajeevana, Additional
Director, Entrepreneurship Development and Innovation Institute of Tamil
Nadu (EDII), an institute that will act as the nodal agency for the
implementation of startup policy, said, "This is a broad policy
document, and we will come out with the detailed guidelines shortly."

She added that the new policy also encourages the participation of
startups in government procurements. "We have introduced relaxation for
startups so that they can participate in public procurements. Conditions
like prior existence, turnover criteria, earnest money deposit (EMD),
and others have been relaxed. This will help them to bid for tenders of
smaller values. We have also allowed government departments and
undertakings to procure products of smaller value from really innovative
startups for at least two times in a financial year," Shajeevana said.

The government will also encourage entrepreneurs by giving them access
to relevant data/information to create apps and technologies for
public-good

Another interesting feature of the policy is the introduction of special
grace marks and attendance relaxation for students if their project work
gets converted into a startup in the incubator. The policy document also
said, "Universities and colleges will encourage as many startups with
inter-departmental and inter-institutional participation, taking note of
the fact that startup planning and management requires
inter-disciplinary skills. A deferred placement support system will be
introduced in all colleges in consultation with industry as a measure of
risk mitigation against failure of student startups."

Tamil Nadu is also planning to encourage the setting up of corporate and
private incubators through CSR funding. The policy says, "State PSUs and
CPSUs shall be encouraged to adopt incubators and channelise CSR funds.
These incubators shall also serve as an innovation sandbox to solve
problems faced by PSUs and CPSUs, which in turn shall support startups
with access to a platform, test bed, data, handholding, etc."

In order to build a world-class startup ecosystem in the state, the
government is also planning to rope in NRIs from Tamil diaspora, and
will allot land at nominal lease for a duration of 99 years to establish
'Startup Parks' led by entrepreneurs/startups, including NRIs."

Technology and society: Digital divide or digital inclusivity?

Newstex Blogs

Nov 05, 2020( e27: http://www.e27.sg Delivered by Newstex) Much of the
world is struggling with deepening political division, economic
inequality and ethnoreligious tensions. The growth of the Black Lives
Matter movement — the largest movement in US history[1], and closer to
home, theMilk Tea Alliance[2], are a number of global movements that
have risen in response to the growing unrest and dis-satisfaction faced
by the general public across the world. Over in the borderless digital
realm, some argue that these rifts will only be exacerbated by the
technologies that connect us. Recent trends seem to agree with their
claim.

Frompopular opinion that social media is a misinformation haven that
threatens to undermine society to sophisticated tools of digital
manipulation such as 'Deepfakes'[3], the odds of misinformation increase
as we transition towards digital societies. This is compounded by the
fact that it is intertwined with existing global socioeconomic
realities. In finance, for example, most of the global unbanked are
individuals living in developing economies in the Global South[4], and
there is debate over whether cashless payments are more inclusive or
exclusive. The rise of the 'sharing economy' has also generated a
considerable backlash, with fears of a rentier economy taking shape even
here in Singapore as more people turn to renting things instead of
owning them due to tightening personal finances. How technology divides
us doesn't stop there either. There's the whole question of the haves
and have-nots: people who are tech-savvy and easily adopt new
technologies, versus people who do not understand how they work or are
denied access to them, inadvertently or otherwise. Also Read:Is Japan
ready for the digital banking revolution?[5] The idea that technology
only serves to divide society can be hard to dispel, but we should also
remember all technology are just tools. Tools that, when in the right
hands, can help us embrace a shared future in tomorrow's digital
societies. Here are some ways in which communities can embrace one
shared future in a digital society[6]:Everyone participates in a digital
societyBefore addressing how technology can bridge communities in a
digital society, we should think about how technologies can connect
everyone to the digital sphere first.According to Singapore's Ministry
of Communication and Information[7], digital readiness involves
'providing access to digital connectivity and devices in a widespread,
affordable manner'. It also requires that participants in digital
society are 'information, media and cyber-literate'. This carries two
implications. One, that new technology that enables people to be part of
a digital society should not be cost-prohibitive and designed in
consideration for various constraints that confront society as a whole.
Two, that people also need to be educated on how to use these
technologies independently and safely, and at the same time be cautioned
on propagating toxic behaviours such as doxxing and online
vigilantism.Technologies are designed with society in mindThe effects of
privatising public services in some countries decades ago are still
keenly felt today. When public functions fall into private hands,
essential services like healthcare and disaster relief may become
prohibitively expensive and are only delivered to those who can afford
them. The same shadow lingers over technology's role in influencing and
transforming digital society. Companies designing these technologies
should consult various stakeholders in society via focus groups and
interviews. They should be as diverse as possible when doing so. Also
Read:Surviving COVID-19: How to adapt your digital marketing strategy
amidst a global crisis[8] This is especially true for AI, where the lack
of diversity has the entire industry facing 'a moment of
reckoning'.[9]Human bias and prejudices do not obscure themselves in a
digital environment. They are simply recreated, more so implicitly, and
potentially amplified under the faade of statistical
objectivity.Technologies broaden and enrich our conversationsOn social
media, there has been a huge uproar over political advertising,
particularly in light of Facebook's refusal to ban such ads. The trend
towards personalised content has also been criticised for fostering
'filter bubbles' that enmesh people in a world where only posts that
reaffirm their beliefs are shown. But technology can also widen our
horizons and create spaces to talk about things in a freer, less
restrictive space. Some EdTech providers like Kialo Edu have learning
systems that facilitate debates in a collaborative rather than the
competitive manner, and other technologies also enable physically and
mentally disabled people to participate in society[10]. In Singapore,
youths have taken to the Telegram chat app to set up 'Open Jio', a group
that promotes volunteerism and social participation in the country.[11]
Technology has also been used to promote awareness of Singapore's
sociocultural issues, just as social enterprise Geylang Adventures has
done; in the case of Mind Palace, technology in the form of virtual
reality is also used to empower the elderly to connect with others even
within the confines of nursing homes. All this goes to show that
technology can strengthen social cohesion by not only adding depth to
our conversations, but also making sure nobody gets left behind in the
process. Progress is often characterised as the enemy of tradition, but
that should not be taken for granted. Technology can synergise both ends
of the spectrum to redefine traditions without consigning them to the
dustbin of society. Gyosen Asakura's audacious fusion of display
lighting, disco beats and buddhist chantsin Japan's Fukui prefecture is
one such example. By combining the new and the old, Asakura's work has
brought together different generations, all of whom thoroughly enjoy his
spectacular light shows. Laser-cut pop-up cards by Lovepopalso prove
this point. Inspired by pop-up cards sold by artisans in the markets of
Vietnam, founders John Wise and Wombi Rose took a traditional craft and
enhanced it by making pop-up cards that feature more sophisticated and
refined designs that traditional methods would have found difficult, if
not impossible, to achieve. Also Read: Lesson from the failure of
several startups in the sharing economy[12] Technology not only has the
potential to not only blend the old and the new but also bring
ethnically diverse communities together as well. We've already seen this
happen in Singapore with the 2011 'Curry Dispute', which culminated in
the popular 'Cook and Share a Pot of Curry' movement. This whole
conversation on race and immigration in Singapore could not have gained
traction if not for YouTube (where the controversial video was posted)
and Facebook (where the movement was first announced). Technology has
also been used to accentuate cultural festivities such as the annual
River Hongbao, Geylang Serai Ramadan Bazaar and Deepavali light up at
Little India. The use of interactive storytelling with digital
environments enliven the festive atmosphere and connect age-old cultural
practices with people from all walks of life.Whither stewards of a
digital society?So it's clear that technology can connect communities
and get everyone on board a shared vision of tomorrow. What we should do
next is to place them in the hands of responsible innovators who can not
only envision but realise a socially cohesive digital society. That's
exactly what is happening next month with the inaugural Mission:Unite
Hackathon[13]. Organised by the Ministry of Culture, Community and
Youth(MCCY) in partnership withStartupX, the Mission: Unite Hackathon
aims to bring together individuals of all ages, backgrounds and
religions to take action in connecting people across diverse racial and
religious backgrounds. Mission:Unite will also see interfaith champions
and society stewards come together to share their thoughts with
participants. This hackathon is just the starting point, as the real
goal is to have these ideas implemented within society, with up to
S$300,000 in grant funding available to help these ideas get off the
ground and take shape. Bridging a digital society will take time and
effort — Mission: Unite will provide a powerful launchpad to get
inclusive ideas off the ground fast. How will technology be used to
build a socially cohesive digital society? We can't wait to find out. -

Get Capital Can Help Prevent Cash Flow Problems with Your SMB

New Delhi, March 16 -- There are many loan providers that can help small
businesses with their capital requirements. One of the most highly rated
companies that currently offers services to clients in the Asia-Pacific
region is GetCapital. This lending company offers multiple business
loans including vehicle and equipment financing, lines of credit with
trade financing, and flexible business loans. With some 90% positive
reviews from 50 reviewers, this alternative financing option is quickly
finding a niche market with clients in the region. In 2016, GetCapital
won significant praise as the second fosters growing company in
Australia by SmartCompany.

Why is Cash Flow So Important for Businesses and What Can GetCapital Do
to Help?

There is one thing that greases the wheels of a business more than
anything else: cash flow. Cash flow is needed to maintain daily
operations, by providing businesses with the means to pay for things,
and to keep your company's operations liquid. Take a moment to consider
your checking account. At any given time, the balance on that account is
likely to fluctuate to the downside. It's only your income - your
salary, wages or payments received that top up the checking account
balance.

Everything else is likely an expense. In much the same way, your small
and medium business (SMB) needs the financial resources to keep daily
operations going. Believe it or not, the #1 reason that businesses fail
is limited cash flow. They simply run out of money to finance daily
activity - sounding the death knell for the enterprise. According to the
SBA (Small Business Administration), it is inadequate cash reserves that
leads to the failure of most startups. That's where non-mainstream
financial companies like GetCapital can really help businesses to stay
afloat. They are specifically designed to provide cash for your SMB.

What is Needed for Improved Cash Flow?

So, how can you guarantee that your business will have sufficient cash
flow? Here are 8 tips to help you keep your business solvent:

* Set a Budget - that means all incomes and expenses should be accounted
for in a clear and unambiguous fashion. If your business is simply
haemorrhaging money at every opportunity, it's the lack of a budget and
a business plan that is causing this problem. Every expense category
should have a monetary accommodation. Stationery, petty cash, wages,
salaries, inventory, water and electricity, rental, mortgage loans,
automobile loans, business credit cards etc. Once you know how much you
are spending, you know how much your company needs to be taking in to
maintain sufficient cash flow.

* Establish a temporary line of credit - we advise businesses to do this
sooner, rather than later. One of the biggest mistakes that too many
small businesses make is that they only start applying for lines of
credit once they are already in a cash crunch. You may wish to check out
GetCapital as a viable option for tiding you through a tough time if you
anticipate a cash crunch situation. They work with established
businesses and have lenient requirements for credit applications.

* Analyse your cash flow - cash flow reports are the only way for you to
effectively manage your cash flow. You need to know what happens when
customers pay bills, when your company purchases merchandise or stocks
up on inventory, and what happens when you adopt point-of-sale systems
and take in less cash? Daily cash flow reports, weekly cash flow
reports, or monthly cash flow reports may be required.

* Project ahead - this is a great forecasting technique that can help
you ascertain your cash flow requirements for the future. A great
forecast is only possible if you're honest about setting realistic
objectives, maintaining the right levels of inventory based on sales,
and you can accommodate for market downturns.

* Set up an effective collection system - if you're too lackadaisical
about collecting money from people who owe you money, you will run into
cash flow problems. Perhaps you are extending credit for too long - for
example 60 days instead of 30 days. How effective is your business's
ability to collect money from debtors? Are you able to identify overdue
payments in time? How do you plan to collect money owing to your
business?

GetCapital's Advice: Communicate the Importance of Cash Flow to
Stakeholders

As you can imagine, having sufficient cash flow in your business can
make the world of difference between staying afloat and sinking. It is
imperative that you set realistic targets and communicate the company's
overall strategy vis-a-vis cash flow to all its employees and
stakeholders in an unequivocal way. Cash flow can make or break a
company, and that's why it's important for startups to plan ahead.
GetCapital requires that a company has been operational for a minimum of
9 months, and a good credit school is typically required to be approved.
The minimum annual sales should be $120,000. The company has received
and 83% excellence rating on TrustPilot Australia, and 3/5 total score
on ProductReviews.com. It's important to consider the many flexible
options that are currently available through non-bank lenders such as
GetCapital loans provider.

This Austin accelerator made big claims; employees and customers say it
didn't deliver

Newchip, an online accelerator promising to help startups, has filed for
bankruptcy and is now facing insolvency amid employee and client
discontent. Dozens of employees of the troubled organization staged a
walkout on May 4, demanding that founder Andrew Ryan step down as CEO.
Ryan - who previously went by the name of Ryan Rafols - started
Austin-based Newchip in 2016 after spending more than seven years as a
city commissioner in Austin, according to his LinkedIn profile.  Newchip
initially started out, according to Silicon Hills News, "as an
aggregator of top deals from various equity-based crowdfunding
platforms," and later evolved into its current accelerator model. In his
LinkedIn profile, Ryan describes Newchip as an entity that provides
"entrepreneurs with all of the skills and tools necessary to build,
scale, and fund their startups from launch to exit" via its "online
global accelerator and venture fund." Essentially, Newchip presented
itself as an accelerator that would help startups meet and raise money
from investors and grow their companies for a fee.

But the accelerator failed to deliver on a number of its promises, some
employees say, and left hanging founders who had signed up. Some
founders argued, in interviews with TechCrunch and in at least one
public post discussion on LinkedIn, that Newchip's fee - which varied
from a few thousand dollars to up to $18,000 or $20,000 - was too high
and not worth the services provided. Some insisted that it was difficult
to impossible to get a refund when the accelerator did not follow
through. Chief among the long list of complaints by eight former
employees who walked out and were interviewed by TechCrunch is
"mismanagement" on Ryan's part. The executive, they claimed, regularly
was aggressive toward individuals in the company via written and verbal
communications, and made poor decisions regarding leadership roles.  One
former employee who wished to remain anonymous told TechCrunch: "He
would routinely often hire either naïve or 'yes man' type employees and
get absolutely ruthless and degrading and demeaning to people while
saying things like 'I'm too good to be wasting my brilliance on this'
and just scream at people." In response as to whether he was demeaning
to employees, Ryan acknowledged that his leadership style was based on
"a military mindset" and that "there have been moments where the line
between accountability and conflict has blurred." He also admitted that
in one particular instance, he could see how his reaction "might have
come across as demeaning." Ryan also added that he's been "known to walk
out of or abruptly end meetings lacking an agenda, emphasizing the
importance of preparation." In a Zoom interview with TechCrunch and in
two different LinkedIn posts (which can be found here and here), Ryan
largely blamed the macro environment, managers and employees for the
company's demise. Via email, Ryan said he ultimately accepted "full
responsibility for the events at Newchip." He claimed to currently be
"in discussions with numerous VC firms, family offices, and PE firms to
formulate a continuity plan." Newchip, operating under Astralabs, filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, revealing that it had just $1.7
million in assets compared to $4.8 million in liabilities. Last week, a
bankruptcy judge ended up converting the case to Chapter 7 liquidation.
This is unsurprising, considering that, according to Silicon Hills News:
"While Newchip raised $7.9 million from accredited and nonaccredited
investors, Crunchbase data reveals a troubling history of financial
losses. SEC filings show a net loss of $197,884 for 2016, a $748,999
loss in 2017, and the company claimed $4.5 million in tax loss
carryforwards in its 2020 financial statements." Ryan claimed the
employees staged the recent walkout to protest the fact that the company
was going to be laying off more employees, and were led by a Newchip
investor. While Ryan did not name the investor, that individual is
believed to be Joe Merrill, who also served as chief of Newchip's board.
(TechCrunch reached out to Merrill but he did not respond to requests
for comment.) Ryan added that the accelerator had already conducted
several rounds of layoffs over the previous six months, going from more
than 200 employees to about 75 at the beginning of this month. Speaking
to TechCrunch, Ryan said: "We had to make cuts across the team and there
was gonna be massive layoffs [...] Otherwise there would be no money to
pay people and we had to cut the business down. And while I requested
approval from the court to take on capital and we had investors ready to
give us capital, our attorneys had failed to file the motion. And so we
basically pushed them to file for [an] emergency filing." He claimed
that employees were not happy with that move and demanded that he "wind
the company down and basically liquidate everything," which he said he
could not do while in Chapter 11 proceedings. Ryan said he went on to
terminate the board. For their part, the eight former employees
TechCrunch spoke with deny walking out due to potentially being laid off
or not getting paid and instead cite Ryan's "lack of leadership and
mismanagement." In their walkout letter (which was shared with
TechCrunch), the employees wrote of their concerns over the dismissals
of "key personnel," saying their "removal has led to an erosion of trust
and morale within the organization, creating a toxic work environment."
The employees demanded the execs be reinstated and that Ryan step down
as CEO "effective immediately."  No one was reinstated. Via email, Ryan
told TechCrunch: "In the end, we were unfortunately compelled to close
the company despite having secured capital commitments to keep it moving
forward due to the takeover attempt and false allegations made to the
court that we could be liquidated for half a billion dollars if the
court just signed off, which understandably led to frustration right now
and a lot of our 1,200 active companies are rightfully upset. I
empathize deeply with everyone affected and am taking every possible
measure to rectify the situation." He also said the company would "be
bringing in a new, more experienced CEO." It isn't just employees who
say they were burned by Newchip. Andrew Goei, founder of PitchPages, a
pitch deck and fundraising software startup, said he wanted a refund a
few months into the program after he felt he was not getting the
promised services, specifically the investor intros.  In an interview
with TechCrunch, Goei recalled Newchip's salespeople telling him the
accelerator "has this huge network and can introduce us to all these
investors." PitchPages would pay $8,000, and if the company didn't get
successful funding, the company would get its money back, Goei said. So
his company signed up in August of that year. "About two or three weeks
into it, we still had no communication from them at all, even though we
paid," Goei said. At that point, PitchPages had paid about $6,000 to the
program. During that time, Goei said he met two mentors from the program
who voiced concerns about Newchip and recommended Goei get a refund.
Weeks would go by before customer support people would respond, and
ultimately he was told there would be no refund, Goei told us.  "It was
very apparent that their whole model was 'get as many startups as we
can. We don't care who they are. We don't care what stage they're in as
long as they pay, that's all that matters,'" Goei said. "And they would
find any way possible and not give any refunds. What  was really sad
about the whole thing is that Newchip was started by this guy who comes
from the VC community."  Founder Orri Bogdan, too, told TechCrunch that
Newchip's salespeople told him that they would offer a full refund if he
failed to raise funding through the outfit, but then "snuck in extreme
stipulations with the intention of never refunding anyone."  The founder
of VAE Labs, which is developing an edible energy spray, Bogdan says
that as a result of Newchip's terms, his startup declined its offer to
"accept" his company in favor of joining a different accelerator. "If we
hadn't gotten into DSHA, we would have definitely accepted and lost
$7,500 to $18,000, with the higher price depending on if we accepted
their $250,000 warrant or not," Bogdan said.  Former Newchip employees
told TechCrunch that the company "rarely issued refunds." They also
claimed that the company paid customers to remove negative reviews. Ryan
disputes both of those claims. He said it was stated in the customer
contract that refunds were not given, for example, when companies
folded. He also said that it was "a very common practice" for customers
to use negative reviews to try and get a refund. "They don't qualify for
refunds, so they leave a review and they email you back and say 'Hey,
give me my refund and I'll take this down,'" Ryan said. "We gave about
$150,000 in refunds a month. For a business that brings in about a
million dollars in tax, that's a significant amount  - that's about
three times the amount that you'd see in any case." Ryan also said he
"tried to train some of the low-level marketing people" to keep up with
positive review management, but that they "would often fail to do that."
Via email, Ryan also claimed that Newchip "lost money on nearly each and
every admission" to its programs "due to the high risk and failure of
startups."  Though the employee group has more recently gone public with
their grievances, they make claims of mismanagement going back years,
including the clawback of sales commissions and Ryan giving himself
bonuses during monthly financial deficits. For example, the group said
sales commissions were awarded when a contract was instituted, but
allege that later they were removed for what they were told were
unsigned contracts, even though the customer was actively paying. Ryan
disputes that allegation, telling TechCrunch that 200 to 300 contracts
weren't signed, amounting to around $1 million, and that he found out
some team members were "lying to clients" and charging accounts anyway.
"We strictly adhered to the principle of paying admissions commissions
only after contracts were signed to our knowledge. Unfortunately, in Q4
of the previous year, we discovered instances of non-compliance within
our admissions team concentrated in a handful of individuals making up
about 10% of our team," Ryan said via email. At that time, the employee
group says Ryan made himself head of sales. When asked if that was
accurate, Ryan confirmed, though he said it was temporary while the
company sought a replacement. Ryan also told TechCrunch via email that
his first year "to receive pay over $75k since 2016" was in 2020, when
he received $92,000, and in 2021 it was $175,000 and in 2022, $287,000,
"equating to approximately 1.4% of revenue." He added that "about a
third of amounts yearly were performance-based bonuses." At the time of
writing, it remained unclear as to what would happen to the
entrepreneurs participating in the program, the remainder of employees
and the company itself. The group of former employees said they are
reaching out to other accelerators and to the startup ecosystem to see
if they can assist the founders affected by the liquidation. Ryan said
he was "in search of a white knight" to support the company and take
over its programs.

Newchip, an online accelerator promising to help startups, has filed for

between accountability and conflict has blurred." He also admitted that
in one particular instance, he could see how his reaction "might have
come across as demeaning." Ryan also added that he's been "known to walk
out of or abruptly end meetings lacking an agenda, emphasizing the
importance of preparation." In a Zoom interview with TechCrunch and in
two different LinkedIn posts (which can be found here and here), Ryan
largely blamed the macro environment, managers and employees for the
company's demise. Via email, Ryan said he ultimately accepted "full
responsibility for the events at Newchip." He claimed to currently be
"in discussions with numerous VC firms, family offices, and PE firms to
formulate a continuity plan." Newchip, operating under Astralabs, filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, revealing that it had just $1.7
million in assets compared to $4.8 million in liabilities. Last week, a
bankruptcy judge ended up converting the case to Chapter 7 liquidation.
This is unsurprising, considering that, according to Grit Daily: "While
Newchip raised $7.9 million from accredited and nonaccredited investors,
Crunchbase data reveals a troubling history of financial losses. SEC
filings show a net loss of $197,884 for 2016, a $748,999 loss in 2017,
and the company claimed $4.5 million in tax loss carryforwards in its
2020 financial statements." Ryan claimed the employees staged the recent
walkout to protest the fact that the company was going to be laying off
more employees, and were led by a Newchip investor. While Ryan did not
name the investor, that individual is believed to be Joe Merrill, who
also served as chief of Newchip's board. (TechCrunch reached out to
Merrill but he did not respond to requests for comment.) Ryan added that
the accelerator had already conducted several rounds of layoffs over the
previous six months, going from more than 200 employees to about 75 at
the beginning of this month. Speaking to TechCrunch, Ryan said: "We had
to make cuts across the team and there was gonna be massive layoffs
[...] Otherwise there would be no money to pay people and we had to cut
the business down. And while I requested approval from the court to take
on capital and we had investors ready to give us capital, our attorneys
had failed to file the motion. And so we basically pushed them to file
for [an] emergency filing." He claimed that employees were not happy
with that move and demanded that he "wind the company down and basically
liquidate everything," which he said he could not do while in Chapter 11
proceedings. Ryan said he went on to terminate the board. For their
part, the eight former employees TechCrunch spoke with deny walking out
due to potentially being laid off or not getting paid and instead cite
Ryan's "lack of leadership and mismanagement." In their walkout letter
(which was shared with TechCrunch), the employees wrote of their
concerns over the dismissals of "key personnel," saying their "removal
has led to an erosion of trust and morale within the organization,
creating a toxic work environment." The employees demanded the execs be
reinstated and that Ryan step down as CEO "effective immediately."  No
one was reinstated. Via email, Ryan told TechCrunch: "In the end, we
were unfortunately compelled to close the company despite having secured
capital commitments to keep it moving forward due to the takeover
attempt and false allegations made to the court that we could be
liquidated for half a billion dollars if the court just signed off,
which understandably led to frustration right now and a lot of our 1,200
active companies are rightfully upset. I empathize deeply with everyone
affected and am taking every possible measure to rectify the situation."
He also said the company would "be bringing in a new, more experienced
CEO." It isn't just employees who say they were burned by Newchip.
Andrew Goei, founder of PitchPages, a pitch deck and fundraising
software startup, said he wanted a refund a few months into the program
after he felt he was not getting the promised services, specifically the
investor intros.  In an interview with TechCrunch, Goei recalled
Newchip's salespeople telling him the accelerator "has this huge network
and can introduce us to all these investors." PitchPages would pay
$8,000, and if the company didn't get successful funding, the company
would get its money back, Goei said. So his company signed up in August
of that year. "About two or three weeks into it, we still had no
communication from them at all, even though we paid," Goei said. At that
point, PitchPages had paid about $6,000 to the program. During that
time, Goei said he met two mentors from the program who voiced concerns
about Newchip and recommended Goei get a refund. Weeks would go by
before customer support people would respond, and ultimately he was told
there would be no refund, Goei told us.  "It was very apparent that
their whole model was 'get as many startups as we can. We don't care who
they are. We don't care what stage they're in as long as they pay,
that's all that matters,'" Goei said. "And they would find any way
possible and not give any refunds. What  was really sad about the whole
thing is that Newchip was started by this guy who comes from the VC
community."  Founder Orri Bogdan, too, told TechCrunch that Newchip's
salespeople told him that they would offer a full refund if he failed to
raise funding through the outfit, but then "snuck in extreme
stipulations with the intention of never refunding anyone."  The founder
of VAE Labs, which is developing an edible energy spray, Bogdan says
that as a result of Newchip's terms, his startup declined its offer to
"accept" his company in favor of joining a different accelerator. "If we
hadn't gotten into DSHA, we would have definitely accepted and lost
$7,500 to $18,000, with the higher price depending on if we accepted
their $250,000 warrant or not," Bogdan said.  Former Newchip employees
told TechCrunch that the company "rarely issued refunds." They also
claimed that the company paid customers to remove negative reviews. Ryan
disputes both of those claims. He said it was stated in the customer
contract that refunds were not given, for example, when companies
folded. He also said that it was "a very common practice" for customers
to use negative reviews to try and get a refund. "They don't qualify for
refunds, so they leave a review and they email you back and say 'Hey,
give me my refund and I'll take this down,'" Ryan said. "We gave about
$150,000 in refunds a month. For a business that brings in about a
million dollars in tax, that's a significant amount  - that's about
three times the amount that you'd see in any case." Ryan also said he
"tried to train some of the low-level marketing people" to keep up with
positive review management, but that they "would often fail to do that."
Via email, Ryan also claimed that Newchip "lost money on nearly each and
every admission" to its programs "due to the high risk and failure of
startups."  Though the employee group has more recently gone public with
their grievances, they make claims of mismanagement going back years,
including the clawback of sales commissions and Ryan giving himself
bonuses during monthly financial deficits. For example, the group said
sales commissions were awarded when a contract was instituted, but
allege that later they were removed for what they were told were
unsigned contracts, even though the customer was actively paying. Ryan
disputes that allegation, telling TechCrunch that 200 to 300 contracts
weren't signed, amounting to around $1 million, and that he found out
some team members were "lying to clients" and charging accounts anyway.
"We strictly adhered to the principle of paying admissions commissions
only after contracts were signed to our knowledge. Unfortunately, in Q4
of the previous year, we discovered instances of non-compliance within
our admissions team concentrated in a handful of individuals making up
about 10% of our team," Ryan said via email. At that time, the employee
group says Ryan made himself head of sales. When asked if that was
accurate, Ryan confirmed, though he said it was temporary while the
company sought a replacement. Ryan also told TechCrunch via email that
his first year "to receive pay over $75k since 2016" was in 2020, when
he received $92,000, and in 2021 it was $175,000 and in 2022, $287,000,
"equating to approximately 1.4% of revenue." He added that "about a
third of amounts yearly were performance-based bonuses." At the time of
writing, it remained unclear as to what would happen to the
entrepreneurs participating in the program, the remainder of employees
and the company itself. The group of former employees said they are
reaching out to other accelerators and to the startup ecosystem to see
if they can assist the founders affected by the liquidation. Ryan said
he was "in search of a white knight" to support the company and take
over its programs.

Learning From Failures

"It's extremely important to learn from failures to not repeat them but
the thing about this is that people rarely open up about misfires"

Please share more about your writing experience and what stood apart
during the process of writing the book.

It was a wonderful experience. I received a lot of feedback from readers
and fortunately, most of it was positive. One underlying comment was
that when they read the book, they didn't feel like they were reading a
book but were in a conversation with me. As an author, that's just great
to hear.

You've alluded to some of the failures in startups and the investing
ecosystem. What was the readers' feedback on some of these stories?

If you want to learn about acting, you'll probably learn from Shah Rukh
Khan or maybe another film industry giant. But there is also the person
who came from the fields of Punjab with a similar dream and didn't
succeed despite investing the years. Eventually, he leaves in
frustration. It is very important to talk about that person's story as
well because one will learn from it.

It's extremely important to learn from failures and not repeat them but
the thing about this is that people rarely open up about misfires. What
makes the book unique is that it also discusses failures. Readers have
come back to me saying that they've liked the 'success' stories but
they've appreciated the 'failures' even more. This is because it offers
a new perspective.

When investors evaluate a startup, what are some of the major things
they are looking for?

I would say that the most important thing is the founder or the
founders' team. If you have the right founder and you have a bad or an
average business model, the founder will figure out a way to make it
work. On the other hand, if you have a wonderful business model but a
very average founder, even a great business model will collapse and I've
seen several examples of that.

The other thing one looks for is passion. This is very important because
you know, you will always have ups and downs. Covid-19 brought us down
for two years. Passion is the only thing that kept us going. If someone
is only looking at making money, he or she will eventually give up in
hard times. What we also look for in the business is how big is the
market and how scalable it is. You have to have a strong growth model
focused on profitability. Therefore, team, passion and the growth model
towards profitability are the key areas.

Imphal's band of brothers launch Manipur's first angel investment
platform

As Manipur's first early-stage investment platform, Imphal Angels hopes
to set the stage for the growth of tech entrepreneurship in the far
Northeast region of India.

The Indian startup ecosystem has come far in the last 10-15 years and it
would not be wrong to say that it has found its feet. But being an
eyewitness to the formation and launch of the first angel investors'
platform in Manipur on November 18, 2018, showed how much more ground
remains to be covered.

A band of intrepid entrepreneurs from Imphal, Manipur, launched the
Imphal Angels, a first of its kind in the far northeast of the country,
on a beautiful Sunday evening in the city. As the town and probably the
rest of the country was calling it a day, these passionate individuals
had gathered a group of more than 60 high-net-worth local businessmen to
sell them the startup story of India.

Hero's return

And boy, did they succeed. It could not have been a better story.
Consider this. A group of local boys growing up together but having to
go their separate ways to pursue their big dreams and ambitions outside
as their small hometown was incapable of making it come true. The boys
return home as successful men and reunite in an attempt to make their
hometown big enough to hold the aspirations of thousands of other young
girls and boys.

Rajesh Sawhney, Gurgaon-based early-stage investor and serial
entrepreneur, who was one of the guest speakers at the launch, tells me,

"There is a big, vibrant market primarily of youth in Manipur in
particular and the Northeast in general, who want to spend."

Commenting on the launch of the Imphal Angels, he remarked that it
brought back memories of the early days when he was part of the Mumbai
Angels. "It shows how tech entrepreneurship is reaching all nooks of
India."

Imphal Angels has been put together by nine entrepreneurs and
professionals, who have relocated to Imphal, to drive tech
entrepreneurship in their home region. They include Chingakham
Priyobrata Singh, Fisher Laishram, Lairenjam Niranjan Singh, Rajkumar
Devkanta Singh, Prasenjit Laikangbam, Nongmaithem Jiten Singh, Dr
Yengkokpam Budhachandra, Dr Arambam Athouba, and Loken Laishram.

Says Nickson Sharma, Investment Analyst at North East Venture Fund, and
an advisor at the Imphal Angels,

"There is this perception that the Northeast means only tourism and
agriculture. But there are some tech-based companies from here who are
expanding to the Philippines and Vietnam, like one of our portfolio
companies, Parking Rhino."

He feels that because of its location, the Northeast has remained
isolated from the other startup ecosystems in India, but people are
trying to bridge the gap with technology. "People like the governing
members of the Imphal Angels have come back from the US and other
countries and that is a good sign," he says.

A dash for a home run

Besides the launch, the main purpose of the event was also to introduce
the concept of angel investing to HNIs in Imphal so that they have the
opportunity to be part of India's growth story. "When I tell them about
success stories like Ola's and how the early investors, who put in as
little as Rs 30 lakh, have gone on to make crores, there's always the
remark, 'Oh! Wish we had known this, we could have put that money," says
Rajkumar Devkanta Singh, entrepreneur and member of the governing body
of Imphal Angels.

In his talk, he explained the concept of how startups were a new asset
class for investors and that it was time to do some smart investing.

Incidentally, Devkanta runs the last-mile delivery for Amazon in Imphal.
He has had a successful career in the corporate world having travelled
across India and the globe and is now back in his hometown. "I was quick
to grab the opportunity of setting up the warehouse and putting in place
a fleet of delivery boys," he tells me.

Interestingly, online shopping is big in Imphal and on an average,
Devkanta's startup has 600-800 packages to deliver in a day.

Terming it as a promising start, Vipul Saini, Head, Partnerships at
Nasscom 10,000 startups, tells me, "Because of its geolocation and easy
access to South Asian markets, which have a robust startups ecosystem,
startups here can act as nodal centres for startups wanting to work for
those markets, plus becoming development centres for existing startups."

Yasuhiro Seo, Partner at Spiral Ventures, who was also a guest speaker
at the event, says he was keen to explore opportunities in Imphal and
also help in setting up the ecosystem in the Northeast.

The Imphal Angels have chalked out a year-long activity calendar where
they will hold workshops on angel investing and introduce startup
batches to potential investors. Looking at the successful launch event,
the members are confident they will have more than 20 signups from
potential angel investors.

Fisher Lasishram, an entrepreneur and member of the governing body of
Imphal Angels, says they have a lot of work ahead of them and he hopes
with the launch of the Imphal Angels they have set the stage for the
growth of the startup ecosystem in the region.

Fisher runs an enterprise software company and a foodtech company in
Imphal and has been profitable so far by keeping his unit economics in
check. "The cost of running a business from Imphal is much less than if
I were to have started out in Delhi or Bengaluru," he says. Fisher
worked for a few years in New York and is now back in Imphal to share
his success with the people in the region by creating employment for
local talent. "I was surprised to find tech talent on par with Bengaluru
and Delhi, the two cities that I have worked in," he says.

There are three engineering colleges in Imphal and Fisher hopes as the
startup culture grows the young graduates will not have to settle for
government jobs or go outside the state. "They can be the talent pool
for startups here," he tells me.

The die is cast

Describing the benefits of becoming a member with their platform, the
Imphal Angels members told the audience that it is not only about
finding untapped opportunities, access to better deals, reduced risks,
high-return potential, but also a way to give back to society and an
opportunity for continued learning.

"All this is good," said a member of the audience voicing what some
others were perhaps thinking as well, "but what if the startup fails?"
Commenting that failure is part of the startup journey, Rajesh connected
with the audience when he said the Vaishnavite (Krishna worshippers)
majority of the region will need to embrace Shiva, the God of death and
destruction if they were to turn angel investors. "Failure is a part of
a startup journey. As an investor, you lose some and you win some," he
said.

The wisdom behind the wit went down well with the audience, but one of
them still thought it worthwhile to ask, "In that case will I get my
money back?"

Clearly, the band of Imphal brothers has a big task cut out for them.
And this is just Day Zero.

Modern-day slavery worsens

The Philadelphia Inquirer

December 28, 2018 Friday

Section: OPINION; Pg. A14

Length: 742 words

Byline: Douglas Pike

In 2014, Pope Francis and other religious leaders gathered at the
Vatican and vowed to end modern-day slavery by 2020. Such wonderful
news: a freedom deadline for all the precious souls held against their
will in brothels, massage parlors, sweatshops, quarries, and other
hellholes.

The faith VIPs - Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish - had a
plan. They'd inspire a torrent of prayers and push governments to
mobilize against slavery. The prayers happened. The mobilization did
not.

Slavery hasn't declined at all. The Walk Free Foundation estimated in
2014 that there were nearly 36 million slaves in the world. Using more
sophisticated methods, Walk Free now puts the toll at just above 40
million enslaved people in 2016.

These dismal numbers cloud my memories of meeting ex-slaves in recent
years. The Brit-turned-New Yorker who spoke in Philadelphia about
escaping from the pimp who groomed and beat her. The antislavery marcher
in Washington who told me about fleeing forced labor on a fishing boat
in Ghana. At Mukti Ashram in New Delhi, the giddy boys rescued from
grueling days spent sewing clothes behind locked doors. At St.
Catherine's Home in Mumbai, the teenage girls freed from windowless
brothels that welcome pedophiles. In hindsight, for every former slave
who touched my heart, a new slave somewhere - including the United
States - went unseen.

If decent people are ever going to stop contemporary slavery, the right
starting point is to face up to our utter failure so far. In the years
since scholar Kevin Bales ripped off the world's blinders with his 1999
book, Disposable People, there's been a gusher of antislavery laws,
alliances, conferences, pledges, documentaries, reports, apps, hotlines,
and prayers. Yet more women, men, and children are enslaved today than
two decades ago.

Why this fiasco? Because the forces for good keep failing to target and
demolish what drives this crime against humanity: huge profits with tiny
risk. Slavery generates as much as $150 billion a year in illegal
profits with virtually no risk that the criminals will get punished. For
this horrific business to crumble, its kingpins must face severe
penalties and meager profits.

Simply put, to end slavery you need to lock up and bankrupt hundreds of
thousands of the enslavers. Bishops and imams can't make that happen;
presidents and prime ministers must.

Shamefully, the people with the power keep failing their duty. The State
Department's latest report on slavery-related crimes says there were
only 7,045 convictions worldwide last year. It's actually a twofold
failure: too few convictions and too many light sentences. Yet when
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo swaggered in front of news cameras to
talk up that report, he didn't mention what stokes the problem - the
massive profits at minuscule risk or acknowledge that slavery is rising.
This is Teddy Roosevelt turned upside-down: Speak loudly and carry a
selfie stick.

What's needed is the kind of radical turnaround plan that Harvard's
Siddharth Kara offered in his extraordinary 2017 book, Modern Slavery.
Kara's core strategy is to squeeze the enslavers' profits and make them
fear financial ruin and imprisonment. His basics include long prison
sentences, severe financial penalties, crackdowns on corrupt police,
tight witness protection, and strict scrutiny of product supply lines.
He calls for global slavery courts, strike forces that can cross
borders, rapid-response teams for war zones, tight protections for
foreign workers, anti-bigotry initiatives, and much more. Embracing this
fierce plan would do what today's abolitionists keep huffing and puffing
and praying about. It would crush slavery.

Meanwhile, the big shots seem content to set goals. In 2015 the U.N.
General Assembly included an end to slavery on its agenda of targets to
hit by 2030. But unless this goal is linked to a disruptive strategy
funded to the hilt, it will end up another bogus promise to millions of
apparently disposable people.

Despite all the solemn words at the United Nations, the Vatican, and
other elite spots, the civilized world hasn't yet steeled itself to
crush this abomination. So in the 21st century, tens of millions of
unseen adults and children remain slaves due to two different kinds of
people: profiteers without a conscience and leaders without a clue.

The Zomato IPO: A Bet on Big Markets and Platforms!

Zomato, an Indian online food-delivery[1] company, was opened up to
public market investors on July 14, 2021, and its market debut is being
watched for clues by a number of other online ventures in India, waiting
in the wings to go public. The primary attraction of the company, to
investors, comes not from its current standing (modest revenues and big
losses), but from its positioning to take advantage of the potential
growth in the Indian food delivery market. In this post, I will value
Zomato, and rather than just make a value judgment (which I will), I
will also tie the value per share to macro expectations about the
overall market. In short, I will argue that a bet on Zomato is as much a
bet on the company's business model, as it is a bet on Indian consumers
not only acquiring more buying power and digital access, but also
changing their eating behavior.

Setting the Stage

As a lead in to valuing Zomato, it makes sense to look not just at the
company's history, but also at its business model. In addition, since so
much of the excitement about the stock comes from the potential for
growth in the Indian food delivery market, I set the stage for that
analysis by comparing the Indian market to food delivery markets in
other parts of the world, as a prelude to forecasting its future path.

Voss Capital is tapping into the affordable housing shortage

The Voss Value Fund was up 11.6% for the second quarter, while the Voss
Value Offshore fund gained 11.2% net. The Russell 2000 returned 4.3%,
while the Russell 2000 Value gained 4.2%, and the S&#38;P 500 was up
8.5%. Q2 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more Year to date, the
Voss Value Fund is Read More[3]

History and Business Model

Zomato was founded in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah, as
Foodiebay, in response to the difficulties that they noticed that their
office mates were having in downloading menus for restaurants[4]. Their
initial response was a simple one, where they uploaded soft copies of
menus of local restaurants, in Delhi, on to their website, initially for
people in their office, and then to everyone in the city. As the
popularity grew, they expanded their service to other large Indian
cities, and in 2010, they renamed the company "Zomato", with the tagline
of "never have a bad meal". The business model for the company is built
upon intermediation, where customers can connect to restaurants on the
platform, and order food, for pick up or delivery, and advertising.
Along the way, the company has transitioned from an almost entirely an
advertising company to one that has become increasingly focused on food
delivery, and in 2021, the company derived its revenues primarily from
four sources:

Transaction Fees: The bulk of Zomato's revenues come from the
transactions on its platform, from food ordering and delivery, as the
company keeps a percentage of the total order value for itself. While
Zomato's revenue slice varies across restaurants, decreasing with
restaurant profile and reach, it remains about 20-25% of gross order
value. It is worth noting that Swiggy, Zomato's primary competitor in
India, also takes a similar percentage of order revenues, but Amazon
Food, a new entrant into the market, aims to take a smaller portion
(around 10%) of restaurant revenues. Advertising: Restaurants that list
on Zomato have to pay a fixed fee to get listed, but they can also spend
more on advertising, based upon customer visits and resetting revenues,
to get additional visibility. Subscriptions to Zomato Gold (Pro): Zomato
also offers a subscription service, and subscribers to Zomato Gold (now
Zomato Pro[5]) get discounts on food and faster deliveries. The service
was initiated in 2017 and it had 1.5 million plus members in 2021,
delivering subscription revenues of 600 million rupees (a little less
than $ 10 million, and less than 5% of overall revenues) in 2021.
Restaurant Raw Material: In 2018, Zomato introduced HyperPure, a service
directed at restaurants, offering groceries and meats that are
source-checked for quality. While direct measures of revenues from
HyperPure are difficult to come by, the revenues that the company shows
under traded goods (which include HyperPure revenues) suggests that it
accounts for about 10% of the total revenues.

In conjunction with the other services it offers to restaurants,
including consulting and data, itsuggests that while food delivery and
advertising arethe company's primary revenue generatorstoday, it has
ambitions extending into the broader food business.Zomato has grown at
exponential rates for much of the last decade, with a surge in the
number of cities that it serves in India, especially in the last few
years, from 38 in 2017 to 63 in 2018 to more than 500 in 2021, extending
its reach into smaller urban settings.

Revenues did drop in 2020, as COVID[6] restrictions put a crimp on the
restaurant business, but the quarterly data suggests that business is
coming back. Along the way, the company has expanded its business
outside India, with the United Arab Emirates being its biggest foreign
market. That revenue growth has been driven partly by acquisitions that
the company has made along the way:

Source: Crunchbase

To fund these acquisitions and other internal growth investments, the
company has been reliant on venture capitalists, who have supplied it
with capital in multiple rounds since 2011:

Source: Crunchbase

These capital infusions created a diverse ownership structure at the
company, even prior to its going public:

Source: Zomato Prospectus[7]

The share of the equity owned but the original founders of the company
has dropped dramatically over time, as the company has had to raise
capital to fund its ambitious growth agenda, and Deepinder Goyal owns
only 5.55% of the company's shares, prior to the IPO. Uber's ownership
in Zomato is a result of Zomato's acquisition of Uber Eats India, where
Uber received a share of Zomato's equity in exchange. As revenues have
grown, the business model for the company has been slower to evolve, as
the company has reported extensive losses along the way, as you will see
in the next section.

The Market

Zomato's business model is neither innovative, nor groundbreaking,
resembling other online food delivery companies in other parts of the
world, like DoorDash[8], which had its initial public offering in 2020.
The allure to investors comes from Zomato's core market in India, and
the potential for growth in that market. To get a measure of this
potential, I start by comparing the size of food delivery markets in
India to the food delivery markets in China, the United States and the
EU.

Zomato Prospectus[9] and Other Sources for EU data

The Indian food delivery market is small, relative to markets elsewhere
in the world, and especially compared to China, the only other market of
equivalent size in terms of population. There are three reasons for the
smaller food delivery market in India, and they are highlighted in the
table above:

Lower per-capita income: Eating out and prosperity don't always go hand
in hand, but you are more likely to eat out, as your discretionary
income rises. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the number of
restaurants increases with per capita GDP, and that one reason for the
paucity of restaurants(and food delivery) in India is its low GDP, less
than a fifth of per capital GDP in China and a fraction of per capital
GDP in the US &#38; EU. Less digital reach: To use online restaurant
services, you first need to be online, and digital reach in India, in
spite of advances in recent years, lags digital reach in China, and is
about half the reach in the US and the EU. Eating habits: Looking across
the regions, it seems clear that there is a third factor at play, a
pre-disposition on the part of the populace, to eat out. Looking at the
number of restaurants in China and the size of its food delivery market,
it is quite clear that Chinese consumers are far more willing to eat out
(either in person at or with delivery from restaurants) than people
living in the US and EU, especially if you control for per capita income
differences.

The Zomato story, or at least the upbeat version of it, is that the
Indian food delivery/restaurant market will grow, as Indians become more
prosperous and have increased online access. A simplistic way to
illustrate the difference is to adjust the size of the market for
per-capita income and digital reach, and I attempt to do that, relative
to the Chinese market, in the table below:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VTq_CBVGjag/YPXp9WIoynI/AAAAAAAAIDc/f5zhSabrgi03N702vCvEwA8laI8Ws7b8ACNcBGAsYHQ/s992/IndiaFoodDeliveryPotential.jpg

Used 2019 food delivery market number for India, and 2020 numbers for
every thing else, in scaling up; COVID effect on 2020 Indian food
delivery market very different from the rest of the world

Put simply, even if Indians had the same per-capita income and digital
reach as Chinese consumers, the food delivery market in India would be
far smaller than the Chinese market, perhaps because eating out is not
as much as entrenched in Indian eating behavior. You can find multiple
flaws with these comparisons, but the core fundamentals that will
determine the size of the Indian food delivery market are clear. The
size of the market in future years will be determined by how robustly
the Indian economy will grow in the next few years, how quickly
digitization continues its advance in the country and if and whether
Indians become more open to eating out than they have historically.

Zomato: Story and Valuation

With the lead in on Zomato's history and business model, I can start
constructing a story and valuation for the company, with the recognition
that the biggest part of the story is in its macro elements. It stands
to reason that disagreements about the story will be largely on those
macro components, rather than in the company-specific components.

The Prospectus

To get the assessment of the company started, I began by looking at
Zomato's prospectus and all of the concerns I noted about excessive and
distracting disclosure that I laid out in last week's post[10] on the
topic, came rushing back to me. The Zomato IPO clocksin at 420
pages[11], much of it designed to bore readers into submission. Let's
start with the useless or close to useless parts:

Definitions and abbreviations: The prospectus starts, and I wonder
whether this is by design, with 17 pages of abbreviations of terms, some
of which are obvious and need no definition (board of directors,
shareholders), some of which are meaningless even when expanded (19
classes of preferred shares, all of which will be replaced with common
shares after the IPO) and some of which are just corporate names. Risk
Profile: If you did not believe my assertions about the pointlessness of
risk sections in IPOs, please do read all 30 pages of Zomato's risk
profile (pages 39-68 of the prospectus). The company lists 69 different
risks investors may face from investing in the company, and after you
have read them all, I dare you to list three on that list that you would
remember. The risk profile starts with a statement that the company has
a history of net losses and anticipates increased expenses in the future
and goes on to add invaluable nuggets such as the "COVID-19 pandemic, or
a similar public health hazard, has had an impact on the our business".
Subsidiary/Holdings Mess: I find it mind boggling that a company that is
only thirteen years old has managed to accumulate as many subsidiaries,
both in India and overseas, as Zomato has done. Since Zomato owns 100%
of most of these subsidiaries, there may be legal or tax reasons for
this structure, but there is no denying that it adds complexity (and
pages) to the prospectus, with no real information benefits.

If you do make your way through this mush, there is useful information
in the prospectus about the company's economics:

Growth &#38; Profitability trends: The company provides three years of
financial statements in the prospectus (2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21)
and you can get a sense of the company's growth and profitability trends
by looking at the annual
numbers:https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tTKmxOhOQes/YPmR72xfcuI/AAAAAAAAIF4/J08RrBYSrXgc52GvZMFqn3ILVIdgmNRFQCNcBGAsYHQ/s916/Zomatofinancialhistory.jpgZomato
Prospectus[12]Since the numbers for 2020 are distorted by the COVID
shutdown, the company provides quarterly numbers for the most recent
quarters to argue that the growth reversal in 2020 will be quickly put
in the rearview
mirror:https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VA8l5qom6_c/YPiuguzuEiI/AAAAAAAAIFY/bCJgONsqj0kGB4mvq35wFqZBpZgi9xUdQCNcBGAsYHQ/s534/Zomato%2BQuarterly%2Btable.jpgZomato
prospectus[13], with 2020 Q1 &#38; Q2 numbers estimatedNote the sharp
and predictable drops in gross orders in the first two quarters of the
2021 fiscal year, but also the increase in gross orders in the last
quarter of FY 2021 (the first quarter of the 2021 calendar year), as the
shut downs ease up.

Unit Economics: The company does provide a sprinkling of unit economics
to suggest that the underlying business is moving towards profitability.
The lead in their argument is the contribution margin, i.e., the slice
of the a typical order that is left as profits, after covering the costs
of catering to that order:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YVgh_Hpzs9g/YPcWkSQtglI/AAAAAAAAIEY/GpnYLYfAbgw_V-5E45xJ_AjIkmfK35caQCNcBGAsYHQ/s2776/UnitEconChart.jpg

Zomato Prospectus

While the graph shows improvement, it is worth noting that the
improvement is based upon a single year's (2021) numbers. There are,
however, other facts about the unit economics that lend to optimism on
the story. In particular, there is some evidence in the cohort table,
where Zomato customers are broken down by how long they have been using
the platform, that usage increases for more long-standing customers:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2NPBvrF06Ls/YPcZOkDA98I/AAAAAAAAIEg/l1Xqmvmht9c6_bvSITJKYYv-IlQmQhvYwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1000/CohortTable.jpg

Zomato Prospectus[14]

The users who joined the Zomato platform in 2017 were not only ordering
three times more than they were initially by the time they had been on
the platform four years, but were also more likely to continue ordering
at those levels in the 2021 fiscal year, when COVID put a dent in the
Indian food delivery business. This is good news, but to make full sense
of it, it would have been informative to see what percent of each year's
users stayed active on the platform in subsequent years, but I could not
find that statistic in the prospectus.

Competitive Advantages: The competitive advantage section could have
been cut and pasted from a dozen Silicon Valley companies in the last
decade, with the networking benefit captured in a loop, where the more a
platform gets used, the more benefits it provides to those on it, thus
creating more
usage:https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DwuDRnykeAg/YPccT3ULITI/AAAAAAAAIEo/1YZbx3mVYcYPj9ItmFupKJRdA11p-1f6wCNcBGAsYHQ/s2910/NetworkPicture.jpgZomato
Prospectus[15] and Uber ProspectusNote the similarities between the
picture to the left, from the Zomato prospectus, and the picture to the
right is from the Uber prospectus, from 2019. That said, there is an
element of truth in these pictures about how growth can lead to more
growth, but neither picture addresses the fundamental business question
of how to monetize this growth, since neither ride sharing nor food
delivery has figured out how to be profitable. Proceeds: The company's
plans for what it intends to do with the proceeds are mixed. A portion
of the initial offering will represent the cashing out of Info Edge, one
of the first venture capital providers to Zomato, and that has no direct
effect on the valuation. Another portion, amounting to approximately 9
billion INR will remain in the firm, to cover future cash needs.

It would be churlish on my part to take issue with the bloat and
selective disclosure in Zomato's prospectus, since they are following
the script that other technology companies around the world have written
for going public, but it is frustrating to read through 420 pages, and
still be left in the dark on key numbers.

The Story &#38; Valuation

The story that I will tell for Zomato has several moving parts to it,
but it can be broken down into the following components:

Total Market: This is the assumption that will make or break Zomato as a
company, since so much of the potential in the company is dependent on
how the food delivery/restaurant market in India evolves over the next
decade. As I noted in an earlier section, even allowing for robust
growth in India[16] and improved digital access, I find it hard to see
the total market exceeding $40 billion, with US $25 billion, in ten
years, being a more likely outcome. (In rupee terms, this will translate
into a market that is roughly 1800-2000 billion INR.) Market Share: The
Indian food delivery market is dominated by two big players, Zomato and
Swiggy, with a third player, Amazon Foods, that is unlikely to fade
away. In my story, I will assume that the market will continue to be
dominated by two or three large players, albeit with lots of localized
and niche competitors who will continue to command a significant slice
of the market. Expecting any company to have a market share that exceeds
40% of this market is a reach, and I will assume that Zomato will be one
of the winners/survivors. In making this judgment, it is worth noting
that the online food delivery markets in other parts of the world (US,
China) seem to be also approaching a steady state of a few large
players. Revenue Share: While the market share and total market yield
the gross order value for Zomato, the company posts only its share of
these orders, as revenues. That number was 23.13% in FY 2020, but
dropped to 21.03% in FY 2021, as shut downs put a crimp on business. I
will assume a partial bounce back to 22% of GOV, starting in 2022, but
the presence of Amazon Food will prevent a return to higher values in
the future. Profitability: The profitability of intermediary businesses
(ride sharing, apartment renting, food delivery) that use platforms to
connect users to service or product providers is still being worked out,
but the contours of how this will play out are visible. The biggest
expenses at these companies are often on customer acquisition and
marketing, and as growth scales down, these expenses should decrease, as
a percent of revenues, delivering a profitability bonus. The biggest
challenge that these businesses face are in the absence of stickiness
and exclusivity, since users can have multiple food delivery apps on
their devices and pick the cheapest one, and in balancing the competing
needs of users and service/product providers with very different needs.
For a food delivery service, restaurants and customers are integral to
the business, and providing a better deal for one may come at the
expense of the other. Online food delivery businesses around the world,
and Zomato is no exception, are facing backlash from restaurants and
delivery personnel, who believe that they are getting the short end of
the stick, as the company seeks to offer lower prices and better
delivery deals from customers. I will assume that pre-tax operating
margins will trend towards 30%, largely because I believe that the
market will be dominated by a few big players, but with the very real
possibility that one rogue player that is unwilling to play the game can
upend profitability. The scariest part of the food delivery market for
Zomato is the identity of its new entrant (Amazon Food), since Amazon is
the most fearsome competitor on the planet, willing to out-wait any
company, if its intent is to capture a market. Reinvestment: One of the
advantages of being an intermediary business is that you can grow with
relatively little capital investment, defined in conventional form (as
plant, equipment or manufacturing facilities). That said, reinvestment
takes a different form for companies like Zomato, with investments in
technology and in acquisitions[17], driving future growth. I highlighted
the acquisitions that Zomato has made over its lifetime, with UberEats
India as its most recent and most expensive illustration, but also noted
that the company has burned through billions in cash to get to where it
is today. I will assume that this need will continue in the near future,
with a lightening up in later years, as growth declines. Risk: In terms
of operating risk, the company, in spite of its global ambitions, is
still primarily an Indian company, dependent on Indian macroeconomic
growth to succeed, and my rupee cost of capital will incorporate the
country risk.Zomato is a money losing company, but it is not a start-up,
facing imminent failure. On the plus side, its size and access to
capital, as well as its post-IPO augmented cash balance, push down the
risk of failure. On the minus side, this is a company that is still
burning through cash and will need access to capital in future years to
continue to survive. Overall, I will attach a likelihood of failure of
10%, reflecting this balance.

With the story in place, and the inputs that come out of it, the
valuation, in a sense, does itself, and you can see the summary of the
numbers below:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hk4FmOhzpb4/YPni7MXaOfI/AAAAAAAAIGI/zaijkn3vRUQdvbM0GSt1CDclqv0CVaoyACNcBGAsYHQ/s1660/ZomatoIPOVal.jpg

Download spreadsheet[18]

With my upbeat story of growth and profitability, the value that I
derive for equity is close to 394 billion INR (about $5.25 billion),
translating into a value per share of 41 INR. That may seem like a lot
to pay for a money-losing company with less than 20 billion INR in
revenues in the most recent year, but promise and potential have value,
especially when you have a leader in a market of immense size. That
said, the stock's pricing (72-75 INR, per share) makes it too expensive,
notwithstanding my story.

Facing up to Uncertainty

If you who are wondering whether the assumptions that underlie my Zomato
valuation could be wrong, let me set your mind at rest by assuring you
that they most certainly are, and it does not bother me in the least.
The reason that they are wrong is simple. I do not control the future,
and no matter how many tools and current information I bring to the
process, there will be surprises down the road. The reason it does not
bother me is because, as I have said many times before, you don't have
to be right to make money, just less wrong than everyone else. I do
think there is a benefit to being open about uncertainty and facing up
to it, rather than viewing it as something to be avoided or acting as if
it is not there. I will use one of my favorite tools, a Monte Carlo
simulation, and quantify the uncertainty I foresee in three of my most
critical assumptions.

Total Market Size: A major driver of Zomato's value is the expected
evolution of the Indian food delivery market. While I projected the
market to increase to about $25 billion in my base case, that is based
upon assumptions about economic growth and digital reach in India that
could be wrong. In the simulation, I allow for a market size of between
$10 billion (about 750-800 billion rupees) to $40 billion (3000-3200
billion INR). Market Share: In the base case, I assume that Zomato's
share of the market will stabilize around 40% by year 5, premised on the
belief that this will be a market with two or three big players, a a
multitude of niche businesses. Given the regional diversity of the
Indian market, it is possible that there may be more players in the
market, in steady state, resulting in a lower market share (as low as
20%) or that the niche players will get pushed out, because of economies
of scale, yielding a higher market share (up to 50%). Operating Margin:
The operating margin of 30% that I predicted in my base case for Zomato
is built on the presumption that the status quo will prevail, and that
the delivery companies will be able to continue to see economies of
scale, while holding their slice of the order value stable. If one of
the players decides to aggressively go for higher market share (by
offering discounts or bidding more for delivery personnel), operating
margins will tend lower (15% is my low end). If, on the other hand,
Zomato is able to keep its advertising business intact as it moves
forward, it could delivery higher margin (45% is my upper end).

Notice that there are two assumptions that analysts often lose sleep
over that I am ignoring. The first is the reinvestment each year, that I
estimate using a sales to capital ratio that varies across time. It
affects my cash flows, but its effect on value is dwarfed by changes in
assumptions about market size and share. The second is the cost of
capital, a number that most valuation classes and books (including mine)
belabor to the point of diminishing returns. Raising or lowering the
cost of capital has an effect on value, but changing my assumptions
about risk premiums, betas or debt ratios has a much smaller effect that
changing assumptions that alter cash flows. The results of the
simulations that I ran with distributions replacing point estimates for
market size, share and operating margin are shown below:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B3pa6ackWTg/YPojcR1D5cI/AAAAAAAAIGQ/v2m-_TIMq3ERrIKFpFeF0pzJZCX0xRwngCNcBGAsYHQ/s1852/ZomatoSimulation.jpg

Put simply, I think it is hubris to dismiss those who invested in Zomato
at 72 INR per share or higher, as speculators or ill-informed, since
there are plausible stories that get you to values higher than 100 INR
per share. That said, given my story and valuation for the company, I
think that at a 70-75 INR per share price, the stock looks over valued
to me.

Add ons and Distractions

The most dangerous moments, when valuing a company, are after you think
you are done, as those who disagree with your valuation (on either side)
come up with reasons for adding premiums for positives about the company
that you may have missed, if they want a higher value, or discounts for
negatives about the company that you should have incorporated, if they
want a lower value. In this section, I will start with the argument that
a platform with millions of users offers optionality, a reasonable basis
for a premium, but one where it can be difficult to attach a number to
the value. Second, I will consider whether the fact that India is a big
market makes Zomato deserving of a premium, and make a case that it is
not. Third, I will confront the oft used contention that value is in the
eye of the beholder, i.e., that Zomato is worth a lot because other
investors believe it to be worth a lot, and examine a pricing rationale
for Zomato. Finally, dismissing Zomato as an investment, just because it
does not make money now, or fails to meet some conventional value tests
on pricing (PE, Price to Book), is investing malpractice.

1. Platform Optionality

As a company with millions of users on its platform, there is an added
layer to value for Zomato or any other platform-based company, thatgoes
beyond the intrinsic valuation above. In effect, if Zomato can deliver
other products and services to the users oftheplatform, it can augment
its earnings and value. This is the "optionality" that some investors
highlight in companies with large user bases (Amazon Prime, Uber,
Netflix), but while I see the basis for the argument, I would offer some
caveats.

First, not all platforms are created equal, in terms of being adding
value, with platforms with more intense users and proprietary data
having more value than platforms where users are transitory and there is
little exclusive data being collected. One reason that I bought Facebook
shares in 2018, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was my belief
that its platform has immense value because of its reach (more than 2
billion users in its ecosystem), their engagement (Facebook users stay
in the ecosystem for long periods) and the data that Facebook collects,
through their engagement (posts, comments etc.). Second, even if you
believe that there is optionality, attach a numerical value to that
option is one of the most difficult tasks in investment. While there are
option pricing models that can be adapted to do the valuation, getting
the inputs for these models, especially before the optionality takes
form, is difficult to do. With Facebook, in 2018, I arrived at an
intrinsic value that was only modestly higher than the price ( <10%),
but used the optionality as the argument for pulling the buy trigger.

Zomato's platform has the benefit of large numbers, but it falls short
on both intensity and proprietary data. Thus, Zomato app users are on
the system only when they order food, and the engagement is often
restricted to food ordering and delivery. If Zomato plans to expand its
offerings to its platform-users, it is very likely that these add-on
businesses will be food-related, perhaps extending into grocery
shopping, creating some option value.

2. A Big Market Premium? <

Indian and Chinese companies, especially in young and nascent
businesses, have an advantage that they often play to, which is immense
local markets. It is not surprising that companies play up this
advantage, when marketing themselves to investors, with some analysts
attaching premiums to value, just because of market size. I believe that
this is a distraction, because that market size should already by
incorporated into the intrinsic value, through growth and margin
expectations. In my base case valuation of Zomato, I assume that
revenues will increase almost ten-fold over the next 10 years, because
the Indian market is expected to grow so strongly. In fact, the danger
to investors, when faced with Indian and Chinese companies, is not that
they will under value these companies, but that they will over value
them, precisely because the markets are so big. In a post[19] and
companion paper[20], I describe this as the big market delusion, where
investors do not factor in the competition that will come from existing
and new players, drawn into the business by the size of the market, and
the resulting drop in profitability.

3. A Pricing Rationale

When you value young companies with promise, the most common push back
that you will get is that value is whatever people perceive it to be,
and young companies can therefore have any value that investors will
sustain. This is a distortion of the word value, but it is true that
young companies are more likely to be priced than valued, and the
pricing will be based upon a simple pricing metric (anything from PE to
EV/Sales) and what investors perceive to be the peer group. With Zomato,
for instance, there are two ways in which investors may attach a pricing
to the company.

VC Pricing: The first is to look at venture capitalists priced the
company at, in their most recent funding rounds, and extrapolating from
that number. In its February 2021 VC round, Zomato was priced at close
to 400 billion INR ($5.4 billion) by a group of venture capitalists
(including Fidelity and Tiger Global), who invested almost 50 billion
INR (about $660 million) in the company. Comparable companies: The only
direct comparable that Zomato has in India is Swiggy, which is still
privately funded, At the risk of stretching the definition of
"comparable firm", I compare Zomato's pricing (using the projected 72-75
INR share price on the IPO) to the pricing of Doordash, which went
public in 2020:

https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7zWXRm0e314/YPi3ri21yEI/AAAAAAAAIFw/0eOXaPQbFvQQR0hLTeX1_SRz-CW9gS1SACNcBGAsYHQ/s1234/Zo%252CmatovsDoordash.jpg

One of the perils of pricing is that you can find almost always find a
way to back up your preconceptions, if you try hard enough. Thus, if you
are a Zomato bull, you could point to the EV/User and argue that it is
cheap, relative to Doordash, whereas if you are a bear, you can point to
Current revenue and GOV multiples, to make the case that Doordash is
cheaper. To make the argument even messier, using forward multiples,
where you scale the current enterprise value to expected revenues or
earnings in 2031, make the Zomato case stronger, since it has higher
expected growth than Doordash does.

The bottom line is that pricing is not a panacea for uncertainty or a
cure for bias, since the uncertainty is just pushed into the background
and there is plenty of room for biases to play out, in how you
standardize price (which multiple you use) and and what your comparable
are.

4. It is a money loser

There are good arguments to be made against investing in Zomato at is
proposed offering price, but one of the emptiest, and laziest, is that
it is losing money right now. I know that for some value investors,
trained to believe that anything that trades at more than 10 or 15 times
earnings or at well above book value, this argument suffices, but given
how badly this has served them over the last two decades, they should
revisit the argument. The biggest reason that Zomato is losing money is
because it is a young company that is trying to take advantage of a
market with immense growth potential, not because it cannot make money.
In fact, if Zomato cut back on customer acquisitions and platform
investments, my guess is that it could show an accounting profit, but if
it did so, it would be worth a fraction of what it is today.

Conclusion

In investing and valuation, there is the presumption that rules and even
the first principles of investing change as you go from one market to
another, and this is particularly true when comparisons are made between
developed and emerging markets. I believe that the first principles of
valuation are the same in all markets, and I hope that I have stayed
true to that belief in this post. I valued Zomato, using the same
process that I used to value Doordash, with the country-specific effects
being incorporated into my growth and risk projections. While I did take
issue with some of the holes and over reach in Zomato's disclosures, I
ran into the same challenges, when I valued Doordash. Zomato is a
money-losing, cash burning enterprise now, but it has immense market
potential and is on track to delivering on a viable business model. It
will face plenty of challenges on that path, both at the micro level
(management, competition) and at the macro level (economic and political
developments in India). I believe that the company is currently over
priced, given its potential, but I would have no qualms about investing
in the stock, if the price drops in the near future, with the full
understanding that this is a joint wager on a company, a sector and a
country.

Dear Pro member,

It seems GoTo Group's cost-cutting measures are paying off.

The Softbank-backed tech giant managed to cut its net loss for Q1 by
41%. Like many other tech startups in the region, GoTo also has been
tightening its purse strings by cutting jobs and arresting cash burns to
survive these uncertain times. Gross revenue also grew 14 per cent
y-o-y.

The firm said in March it would cut 600 more jobs after the layoff of
1,300 employees announced in November. As per some reports, the reduced
head count saved it about 210 billion rupiah (US$14.3 million) in Q1.

The group expects to turn profitable in Q4 on higher revenue growth and
reduced costs; savings from the jobcuts announced in March will be
reflected from May onwards, says CEO Andre Soelistyo.

This is the top story of this edition of Ecosystem Roundup.

Also, take a look at the other major developments in Southeast Asia's
startup industry.

Regards,

Sainul.

With over one million startups, 10,000 incubators and accelerators, and
750 unicorns, the G20 nations are at the forefront of innovation and
entrepreneurship.

Startups have become integral to driving innovation and growth across
various industries. With their innovative solutions for untapped
opportunities and unaddressed challenges, startups play a key role in
advancing technology in areas, including education, agriculture,
healthcare, energy, and climate resilience.

The G20-a group of 20 major economies representing roughly 85% of the
global GDP, 75% of global trade, and two-thirds of the world's
population-has a thriving startup ecosystem.

With over one million startups, 10,000 incubators and accelerators, and
750 unicorns, the G20 nations are at the forefront of innovation and
entrepreneurship.

Various presidencies have introduced different engagement groups-Women20
(Turkish Presidency in 2015) and Science20 (Germany's Presidency in
2017). Similarly, India's G20 presidency launched the Startup20
Engagement Group-a dedicated platform for startups.

Earlier in G20 meetings, the Business20 engagement group handled all
discussions related to startups. For the first time now, startups have
got a dedicated forum under the G20 umbrella.

By having a dedicated forum for startups, the G20 nations can work
together to support and enhance the growth of the startup ecosystem. It
will not only drive progress and innovation within the G20 but also have
a positive impact on the global economy and society as a whole.

Official platform for startups empowerment

Startup20 is a platform for entrepreneurship and innovation leaders from
the G20 countries to collaborate and formulate policy recommendations to
support the development of startup ecosystems.

It aims to bridge the knowledge gap between the G20 countries and
emerging economies and establish a Global Innovation Centre to encourage
cross-border collaborations.

One of the key discussions will be on how to reduce the failure rate of
startups and explore how some startups have become global enterprises.
The group will also focus on the role of startups in disaster management
and the incentives governments can provide to support their efforts.

The formation of an international network of entrepreneurs, investors,
and mentors will help new businesses grow, provide a platform for
exchanging ideas and best practices, and encourage R&D partnerships.

Besides economic objectives, Startup20 is committed to promoting
inclusiveness and environmental sustainability. It believes that
supporting startups across the G20 countries will lead to a more
equitable and sustainable future.

What is the modus operandi?

Startup20 will bring together key stakeholders from the startup
ecosystem of the G20 countries, including founders, investors, and
government officials, to develop and implement policies and programmes
to support the growth of startups.

It has established three task forces to harmonise startup ecosystems in
the G20 member countries by proposing recommendations for their
development and growth via multilateral cooperation.

Each task force has a council comprising experts from private and
government organisations from the G20 nations. It has a Chair (Indian)
and Co-chair (international delegate) responsible for leading and
coordinating the task force's activities.

* The Foundation and Alliances Task Force will foster greater cohesion
within the global startup ecosystem by establishing common definitions
through consensus-building while facilitating the creation of a global
community that encourages knowledge sharing among various startup
ecosystems to uncover new opportunities. Additionally, partnerships will
be formed between enablers, including incubators and government
agencies, to bridge the knowledge gap between the startup ecosystems of
G20 nations and emerging economies, allowing a broader range of industry
players to collaborate with startups and develop solutions.

* The Finance Task Force aims to enhance funding availability for
early-stage startups by creating financing and investment platforms
specifically tailored to their needs. It will expand the range of
financial instruments available to startups, potentially enabling
traditional lenders to view them as an asset class. Additionally, the
initiative will facilitate opportunities for startups to pitch ideas and
connect with the global investor community, increasing their visibility
and access to funding.

* The Inclusion and Sustainability Task Force aims to enable more
investors to invest responsibly in startups built upon sustainable
practices. Further, it involves developing initiatives to promote
diversity and inclusion in the ecosystem.

The Startup20 activities will span four events. The inception event was
held on January 28-29, 2023, at Hyderabad. The second event, Startup20
Sikkim Sabha-focused on the Deliberation of the Taskforces-concluded on
March 18-19, 2023, at Gangtok, Sikkim. The next summit will take place
on July 3, 2023, at Gurugram, following which the last event is
scheduled for June 3-4, 2023, at Goa.

How can people engage with this group?

Several opportunities are available for those who intend to engage and
contribute to Startup20:

* Host a Startup20x event: One can organise a Startup20x event in their
city or region-a local event to bring together entrepreneurs, investors,
and other startup enthusiasts to discuss topics related to startups and
innovation.

* Become a task force member: One can become a Startup20 task force
member and contribute to various initiatives, including policy
recommendations, research, and events.

* Partner with Startup20: Any startup or organisation working with
startups can partner with Startup20 to showcase their products or
services and collaborate on various initiatives.

* Showcase one's startup: A startup can showcase its product or solution
as part of the Startup20 events, which can help them gain exposure,
connect with investors, and find potential customers.

The effective manufacturing test has an important role to play in
ensuring the quality of connected medical devices. Here is how it can
help.

The advent of IoT is driving transformation in healthcare. Rising
healthcare costs and consumer demands for better healthcare delivery are
driving the widespread use of IoT in healthcare. This evolution is
commonly known as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Today, we can
easily find medical devices that are connected, such as ultrasound
imaging systems, glucose monitors, bedside monitors, pacemakers, hearing
aids, and wearable health monitors. With IoMT devices, non-critical
patients can stay at home and be monitored through these devices to
decrease hospital admissions and reduce costs. The overall IoMT market
is expected to grow from USD72.5 billion in 2020 to USD188.2 billion by
2025, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.0%. We will see the
IoT greatly influencing all aspects of the healthcare segment, from
monitoring, to diagnostic, to surgery and patient care.

Medical device manufacturers face unique challenges when incorporating
IoT. Many medical devices are used in mission-critical applications.
Therefore, they must be very reliable and long-lasting. The wireless
connectivity needs to be always-on and reliable 24/7 year-round, and it
needs to work seamlessly in difficult physical environments. These
requirements are pressuring medical device manufacturers to implement
reliable, efficient, and cost-effective manufacturing test strategies.

The importance of effective manufacturing test

Many medical devices are subjected to thorough characterization during
the design stage to ensure device quality. However, in manufacturing,
assembly process variation, supply chain component deviation, test
system repeatability, and operator handling errors can introduce failure
into the device. Some of these defects may not be detected during
manufacturing tests due to lack of coverage in the test system.
Marginally passed units may cause field failures during actual usage due
to degraded performance.

To stay competitive in the market, manufacturing tests are normally
optimized to achieve low cost-of-test with fast test time to meet market
cost expectations. The device may only be tested under certain minimum
conditions deemed sufficient. For instance, a wireless medical device
OEM recently faced issues with the effectiveness of its manufacturing
test setup. A custom version of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device
managed to pass all manufacturing tests but was later found to have
intermittent connection issues. After troubleshooting, it was found that
the device had a distorted antenna pattern, causing much lower power in
some of its BLE channels. In production testing, only a very simple
connection test was performed that was not able to catch these
intermittent connection issues during actual operation.

Capital equipment cost vs. potential saving

A defect that is detected during the initial manufacturing phases may
not cost a lot to fix. However, the cost increases exponentially as the
detection happens after the production test or in the field during the
end user's applications.

Investing in the right test solution is important during the new product
introduction (NPI) phase. It may look expensive to invest in an RF
tester and the required operators to execute the tests correctly. There
are also annual maintenance and calibration costs. However, the
potential savings from detecting the failure early during manufacturing
saves the direct and indirect or hidden costs of a field failure. The
hidden cost due to warranties, failure troubleshooting, handling of
replacement units, loss of sales due to bad reputation, or even
penalties arising from the use of defective products, can potentially
total huge amounts of money.

With the correct test strategies implemented in production,
manufacturers can easily recoup the initial RF tester investment within
the first year. The table below shows an example of potential cost
savings. With the right test strategy, the potential cost saving can go
up to USD250,000, with savings in warranty cost, and indirect/hidden
cost in the event of shipment recall and so forth.

Let us now explore how leading medical device manufacturers are
optimizing their manufacturing tests to ensure device quality, increase
manufacturing yield, improve test system flexibility, or improve
manufacturing throughput.

Ensure quality of BLE wireless charger

It was the first attempt for a medical device company to incorporate
wireless connectivity into their products. This company was developing a
BLE-enabled wireless charger. By enabling wireless connectivity to the
charger, users can easily monitor the charging state and the battery
level in order to prolong the battery life. During the design phase, the
engineer needed to validate that the antenna and the matching circuits
were performing according to the design goals.

As the product was developed using an RF module, the engineer skipped
the full parametric testing according to the Bluetooth requirements. The
RF performance was guaranteed by the module maker. As the engineer made
modifications to the reference design and the antenna to fit into their
form factor requirements, the engineer had to run full validation at the
end device level to ensure the device was transmitting and receiving BLE
signals properly in various end-user scenarios. The company used an
over-the-air (OTA) wireless tester specifically designed for IoT
applications, to perform transmitter output power measurements and
receiver packet error rate (PER) and sensitivity measurements.

The engineer used OTA measurements to validate the overall device
transmitter and receiver performance including the antenna. The engineer
could also choose to test all 40 BLE frequency channels, or selectively
test any channels of interest. With this capability, the engineer could
validate the performance of the radio covering the entire BLE frequency
band.

The manufacturer also uses the same test setup in manufacturing tests,
as it is cost-effective and simple enough for operator use. The
production test is optimized by performing TX power and RX PER test at
only three frequency channels - the lowest, middle, and highest
frequency channels, to quickly validate the device performance over the
entire BLE frequency band. This has helped the medical device
manufacturer accelerate production and minimize correlation issues that
frequently happened due to different test setups being used in design
and manufacturing.

In this case, the manufacturer has saved weeks of test development
during the pilot phase, reduced time-to-market, and ensured device
quality by adopting an effective test solution that offers the required
test coverage.

Case study 2

Improve yield for wirelessly controlled surgical machine

A manufacturer faced yield issues with their high-end surgical machine,
which includes a wireless subsystem for remote control purposes. The
wireless subsystem worked properly until failures started to show up.
This became a big problem and impacted their shipments, as they only
discovered failures after the complete machine was built and tested.

When the subsystem failed, they had to spend long-time troubleshooting,
repairing, and retesting. This caused inventory pileups and shipping
errors. To fix this problem, they used a simple and cost-effective IoT
signaling tester to do a pre-screening test of the wireless modules
before they were installed into the wireless subsystem in their machine.
Identifying defect modules before they were installed gave the
manufacturer tremendous savings in test and repair time. This eventually
allowed them to meet their daily output and yield targets.

Case study 3

Improve production flexibility for a contract manufacturers of low
volume medical wearables

A leading contract manufacturer manufactured medical wearables for many
different brands. Their existing test solution was based on a
non-signaling one-box-tester. Because the test was conducted in
non-signaling mode, special test firmware had to be loaded to the device
before testing. Then, it had to be removed and replaced with final
production firmware after the test was complete.

The maintenance of these large sets of firmware for different products
was painful for the manufacturing team. Operator handling error was also
a key risk for them as they manufactured a wide range of devices from
different customers. To improve the production flexibility and eliminate
operator handling errors, they switched to an IoT wireless tester that
enabled signaling OTA testing using final production firmware. This
helped them to streamline the test processes and allowed them to easily
switch between different product versions or brands. The tester also
supported major short-range formats like BLE 4.2, BLE 5, WLAN 2.4-GHz,
and 5-GHz so they could use the same test setup to test devices with
different radio formats. Production flexibility is important for
contract manufacturers to cater to volume fluctuations from their
customers.

Case study 4

Increase manufacturing throughput and reduced cost-of-test of
high-volume wearables

A leading wearables manufacturer was investigating their next-generation
test platform. Part of their goal was to achieve higher throughput and
reduce cost-of-test without sacrificing test coverage. They understood
that there could be no compromise in quality in the medical industry.
Their existing test solution was time-consuming and operator-intensive.
It involved manually putting the DUT into the shield box, running the
test, removing the DUT from the shield box once the tests were
completed, inserting a new unit, and repeating the process. It was
running in sequential mode. By switching to a test solution that enabled
parallel testing of multiple devices, test time was significantly
reduced. The operator can put four devices into the same shield box at
one time and run the required TX and RX tests simultaneously on all four
devices. Once the tests are completed, the operator removed all of them
and replaced them with four new units to continue the test. With
parallel testing capability, the manufacturer managed to cut test time
by more than four times, resulting in significant throughput increases
and cost of test reductions.

What does it mean?

Connected medical devices are on an exponential growth trajectory.
Adding wireless connectivity on medical devices brings tremendous
conveniences to patients, allowing better healthcare delivery and
lowering healthcare costs. The success of this megatrend will depend on
the ability of medical device manufacturers to produce reliable and good
quality connected medical devices that will not fail prematurely in the
field. Effective manufacturing tests play a critical role in ensuring
device quality by capturing defective or marginally passed devices that
can potentially fail in the end-user application. Selecting an effective
test strategy will help to minimize this risk without incurring high
manufacturing costs.

GUWAHATI: Inspired by Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari
to Kashmir, the Congress on Tuesday launched a yatra in Assam from the
border town of Golakganj in Dhubri district near the Bangladesh border
to the easternmost tip in Sadiya bordering Arunachal Pradesh.The
foot-march will cover 834 km in 13 districts across the Brahmaputra
Valley in 70 days. AICC general secretary and the party's Assam
in-charge, Jitendra Singh, and state PCC chief Bhupen Borah inaugurated
the yatra in the presence of scores of senior party leaders. Hundreds of
Congress workers and leaders joined the mass connect programme in the
party stronghold, Dhubri.The Congress is eyeing a revival of its support
base ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and next year's rural polls in
the state where it ruled for three successive terms from 2001 to 2016.
Congress leaders launched a scathing attack on the BJP and Badruddin
Ajmal's AIUDF, accusing both of resorting to divisive politics.

"There is huge enthusiasm among the people. It is a campaign by the
people of Assam who feel deceived by the BJP misrule," said Singh.Ajmal,
who represents Dhubri in the Lok Sabha and caused massive erosion in the
Congress vote bank in minority-inhabited districts like Dhubri, in the
last one decade, was the target of his attack. He said Ajmal has
hoodwinked the people of Dhubri and alleged that the perfume baron has
'sold off votes' and bought 'agar' (agarwood is used for making
perfumes). "Ajmal is working as an agent of the BJP," Singh alleged.He
accused the BJP of breaking up Assam on the basis of caste, religion and
region. "The anguish of the people against the ruling BJP will unite
Assam," Singh added.Borah said 13 big leaders of the party will
spearhead the yatra in Assam. He said from finance to health,
agriculture and education, the state is in a mess though the party would
want the people to believe otherwise. "The BJP has started trading
religion to cover up the failures of their government," he alleged.While
the BJP took a dig at the Congress for selecting a minority-inhabited
district to start the yatra to appease minorities, Borah claimed the
Congress leaders started the yatra after offering prayers at the
Mahamaya temple and Vaishnavite monastery Ramrai Kuthi Satra. Congress
Nagaon MP, Pradyut Bordoloi, promised Rs 25 lakh from his MP fund for
the development of the satra.The yatra will move through Bongaigaon,
Barpeta, Nalbari, Kamrup, Guwahati, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat,
Sivasagar and Dibrugarh before culminating at Sadiya in Tinsukia
district in eastern Assam. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

[TechSparks 2020] Why founders should keep brand thinking in mind while
starting a company

Yourstory.in

At the 11th edition of YourStory's flagship startup-tech event
TechSparks, Kiran Khalap, Co-founder of Chlorophyll Brand Consultancy,
explained the significance of branding behind building a successful
company.

Building a startup is not uncommon. Thousands of people want to be
entrepreneurs, however, what most don't get right is the branding.

At the 11th edition of TechSparks, Kiran Khalap, Co-founder, Chlorophyll
Brand Consultancy, expanded on the need for branding, and explained the
benefits and the formulation of brands for companies.

He began by referring to a report by Failory.com which states that a
startup is characterised by its growth/scalability and innovation.
However, a startup is, in essence, a business experiment that has
potential.

"This means that real startups are prone to failure by definition. They
are testing assumptions and these assumptions are likely wrong. When you
put this new kind of risk on top of the traditional risks of starting a
business, it's no surprise most startups fail. What you want here is not
money but time to get the branding right," Kiran said.

Globally, the success rate of startups is 1:10. While the reasons for
failure can be many, the report showed that the three major factors were
attributed to the lack of product-market fit, marketing problems, and
lack of proper team culture.

"This is where a brand comes to action. Brand thinking can de-risk these
problems," Kiran added.

Influence of intangible assets

About a decade or two ago, tangible factors were highly influential in
starting a company. However, over the years, the trend started to
reverse.

Kiran said, "Digital technology has transformed the intangible into
tangible influences that can be measured and monitored."

As per a report by Ocean Tomo, the contribution of tangible influences
to the market capital have decreased. From 1975 to 2020, there has been
a total reversal of the contribution of intangible assets.

This means that firms that have tremendous market capital are those with
a lot of intangible, ideational, and intellectual property claims.

"For example, Apple has a brand value of $200 billion because it has
75,000 patents. Simply put, the brand is an intangible idea. It is an
idea that guides how we run the organisation and do business," he
explained.

Identifying the mindset

According to Kiran, identifying the right product-market fit is another
aspect of building a successful business.

"If the brand is defined well, it allows it to enter multiple businesses
with lower investments. A well-defined brand is one that is not tied
down to a category but is anchored in a mindset. This is the starting
point of brand thinking. Brand thinking begins by understanding the
mindset common to multiple segments - that your brand can connect. This
is also called social context," he explained.

A social context is a mindset that can be either geographically,
demographically or categorically agnostic. This allows the brand to
connect to more people than just those who are using the product at that
point.

Kiran also highlighted an emerging individualistic mindset whereby
people started considering self needs as important as the family needs.

"Thus whatever startup that you have, you will have to find out what is
the mindset that is relevant to your startup. These mindsets are
expressed in multiple behaviours. It's a startup's job to find out what
that mindset is," he said.

"It is thus important to do secondary research on global trends as well
as primary research to understand the local expression. What you need is
continuously talking and understanding to find out what the intended
user has as their mindset," he added.

This step prevents an entrepreneur from falling in love with their own
idea. Instead, it builds the primary quality that your offering needs -
relevance.

Finding the core idea

The second step in brand thinking, according to Kiran, is finding the
core idea that drives your business.

But how do you do that? Find the brand beyond category, archetype and
values, and find what is common.

Kiran gives the example of Amul. It creates prosperity for all
stakeholders - including customers and farmers - who provide them with
milk. They are caregivers and democratise the market. Amul was one of
the few brands to increase the pay to the farmers during COVID-19
crisis. Their motto is value for money and value for many.

"When you find the brand core which is beyond the product category, it
prevents from error two - which is the inability to pivot. Once the
first two steps are done, then what is critical is the alignment.
Everything including the brand name, identity, and experience then come
into alignment with the brand," Kiran added.

Building an internal culture

'Hire for values and train for skills.'

Kiran urges the companies to follow this motto. He explained that the
first step as part of building an organisational culture is the right
hiring and induction. This is followed by the second aspect, which is
how the leader behaves. This then leads to rewards and deterrents, which
is crucial in creating culture.

Kiran concluded by saying "If your values are clear, you need to make
sure that everybody - big or small lives up to those value. Align values
and behaviour to create your own culture- so you attract the right
people."

[Matrix Moments] Avnish Bajaj on market gap, strategy, and how it helps
startups

In this week's Matrix Moments, Avnish Bajaj, Founder and Managing
Partner, Matrix Partners India, talks about how thin edge of the wedge
can help founders get market share, and more.

"Every founder is starting a business to tap a market. There are two
aspects to be considered - one is the product-market fit (PMF), and the
other is the go-to-market (GTM) avenue. While the former is your reward,
the latter is your risk management strategy," says Avnish Bajaj, Founder
and Managing Partner, Matrix Partners India in this week's Matrix
Moments, a podcast series run by the company.

He further explains that PMF determines the success or failure of a
startup, whereas GTM is your risk management strategy towards PMF.
Businesses are aimed at filling a certain market gap, and products are
built to address that gap. He warned that while it may sound easy, it is
very hard to get everything right at the same time.

"You need to first develop a product, and then aim it at the right place
in the market, which is the GTM. And then hopefully the fit happens,"
says Avnish. Taking to football as an analogy, Avnish explains that
while the PMF is your goal, the GTM is the game to get to that goal. Who
is passing the ball where, the offence and the defense, where you are on
the field, and how you pass the ball between various phases of the
businesses, is what will determine your success, he adds.

Thin edge of the wedge

The GTM strategy is a marketing approach and it is the internet world's
way of defining the 4Ps - price, placement, promotion, and product. How
you position your product in the market, pricing decisions, and product
promotion is what GTM signifies.It is important to analyse your
customers' or consumers' pain points and then think about how best to
position them.

Avnish explains that in today's world, one can combine the best
practices of the enterprise side into a consumer company, and vice
versa.

"I think the best articulation of both PMF and GTM is thin edge of the
wedge," says Avnish. When I meet with founders who are pitching, besides
their GTM strategy, I also ask them to highlight that one feature that
they can build upon.

"Take Zoom for example - their free 45-minute offering is a freemium
model, and nothing but a thin edge of the wedge. Give something for free
and then you can build on it," Avnish says.

Indian-origin Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani faces trial in mega health fraud

San Francisco, Jan 4 (IANS) With youngest billionaire Elizabeth Holmes
being found guilty of defrauding investors as founder and CEO of
healthcare company Theranos in the US, his partner and the company's
COO, Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani, now faces his own fraud trial for the same
charges, which is set to begin in February.

Indian-origin Balwani was Holmes' 'boyfriend in secret'.

'They met when Holmes was 18 and Balwani was 37 -- she moved in with him
the year after she dropped out of Stanford. She also said during the
trial that she was raped as a Stanford student, which is part of why she
didn't finish her degree,' TechCrunch reported.

During the four months of court proceedings, Holmes has detailed
Balwani's controlling behaviour, including a written document that
dictated her daily schedule, including what she ate, when she slept and
how she dressed.

She said, 'He was so disappointed in my mediocrity and he was trying to
teach me how to be better.'

Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 and the company was once valued at more
than $9 billion. In 2015, an expose in The Wall Street Journal revealed
major problems with Theranos' technology. In 2018, Holmes and Balwani
were charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine
counts of wire fraud.

According to the indictment, the charges stem from allegations that
Holmes and Balwani engaged in a multi-million-dollar scheme to defraud
investors, and a separate scheme to defraud doctors and patients.

Both schemes involved efforts to promote Theranos, a company founded by
Holmes and based in Palo Alto, California. Theranos was a private health
care and life sciences company with the stated mission to revolutionise
medical laboratory testing through allegedly innovative methods for
drawing blood, testing blood, and interpreting the resulting patient
data.

According to a Department of Justice press release, Holmes and Balwani
used advertisements and solicitations to encourage and induce doctors
and patients to use Theranos's blood testing laboratory services, even
though, according to the government, the defendants knew Theranos was
not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for
certain blood tests.

'It is further alleged that the tests performed on Theranos technology
were likely to contain inaccurate and unreliable results,' the statement
read.

Holmes and Balwani defrauded doctors and patients by making false claims
concerning Theranos's ability to provide accurate, fast, reliable, and
cheap blood tests and test results, and by omitting information
concerning the limits of and problems with Theranos' technologies.

The defendants knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing
accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests, including the
tests for calcium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, HIV, Hba1C, hCG,
and sodium.

However, they explicitly represented to individuals via advertisements
that Theranos's blood tests were cheaper than blood tests at
conventional laboratories to induce individuals to purchase their blood
tests.

The indictment alleges that the defendants used a combination of direct
communications, marketing materials, statements to the media, financial
statements, models, and other information to defraud potential
investors.

In a big twist for the high-profile trial, Holmes took the stand herself
to argue that her failure as a startup founder doesn't mean she
committed fraud.

'In a key moment, Holmes alleged that Theranos COO Ramesh 'Sunny'
Balwani abused her,' the TechCrunch report said.

ET Startup Awards 2021: ZestMoney's Lizzie Chapman wins the Woman Ahead
award

In the end, it all boiled down to Lizzie Chapman's perseverance. The
ETSA jury highlighted this as one of her most significant attributes in
a highly competitive financial services industry.Chapman pipped Sugar
Cosmetics chief executive Vineeta Singh to emerge as the winner in the
Woman Ahead category.The elite jury, which discussed various parameters
before picking Chapman, also acknowledged how Singh, a close contender
for the top spot, had been building ventures in the beauty space-earlier
with FabBag-before hitting it big with Sugar Cosmetics, a brand designed
for Indian women."Almost 10 years ago, we saw that Indian consumers
would love a product that had the lowest costs and was the easiest to
use. We were probably a tiny bit too early, but the observations we had
then that BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) was going to be much needed in the
Indian ecosystem has finally become very obvious," Chapman
said.ZestMoney recently raised $50 million in its Series C funding
round, from global BNPL provider Zip Co Ltd.Chapman's journey in
financial services goes back to 2011 when she was the India head of
UK-based BNPL player Wonga.In 2015, amid a funding frenzy in the startup
ecosystem locally, she founded ZestMoney with former colleagues from
Wonga, to make digital goods and services accessible to the masses.The
platform is a three-way marketplace - for consumers, for merchants, to
whom it offers payment solutions, and lenders, for which it is a
software and acquisition partner.The company has partnered with
point-of-sale platforms to make its BNPL solutions available across
75,000 offline stores, in addition to its 10,000 online partners.About
70% of its customers are from tier II and tier III cities and most are
new to credit or have only limited credit exposure.In the next year, the
company plans to take its offline network to 400,000 stores."ZestMoney
has built something unique which I personally haven't seen anywhere
else.

Also, it's scaled not just online, but also offline in partnership with
point-of-sale. By essentially competing and winning in this competitive
category, Chapman and ZestMoney deserve to get the award," said jury
member Gokul Rajaram, the product and business leader at US-based food
delivery platform DoorDash.While inclusivity of women in the tech world
is a challenge globally, spotlighting their work inspires the next
generation of women to "reach for the stars," Chapman said. "One amazing
thing that happened just from being nominated was that so many young
women reached out. I'm meeting a few women to help them with fundraising
and other things," she added.Also Read: Buy Now Pay Later is the flavour

Proteas have mountain to climb

Hindustan Times Mumbai

September 12, 2019 Thursday

Copyright 2019 HT Digital streams Ltd All Rights Reserved

Length: 791 words

Dateline: New Delhi

Body

New Delhi, Sept. 12 -- January 2018. South Africa's then head coach,
Ottis Gibson, launched a grand 'Vision 2019', a master plan to break the
Proteas' choking streak at the World Cup.

August 2019. Gibson and his entire coaching team got the boot by Cricket
South Africa (CSA). Only three wins in nine matches in England had left
the 'vision' somewhat blurred.

Gibson's blueprint for succeeding involved experimentation and rotation,
all leading up to the big prize. It never came. Retirements, tightly
packed bilateral ODI series leading to fatigue and an injury-list that
kept getting longer right into the World Cup meant that the Proteas
finished seventh-only above Bangladesh, West Indies and Afghanistan. "We
only had 18 months, probably less than 18 months to build a team, so
time was always against us," Gibson would go on to say after the exit.

In less than 18 months, South Africa will go into another ICC event-the
World T20 in Australia, a tournament where they have reached the
semi-finals on two occasions. Shaking away the disappointment of the
bygone World Cup campaign and rebuilding in time for the World T20 is
their big challenge. The journey won't be easy but it offers redemption
too.

The first step on the long road to the World T20 will be taken on Sunday
in Dharamsala, where the three-match T20 series against India begins.
This is South Africa's first assignment post the World Cup meltdown and,
understandably, the squad bears a fresh look.

The last time South Africa toured this part of the world for a T20
series in 2015-16, they prevailed 2-0. Only fast bowler Kagiso Rabada
remains from that squad for the upcoming series. According to SA's
interim team-director Enoch Nkwe-another new face that has been brought
in as part of the post-World Cup shake-up-South Africa have already
begun wiping the slate, starting with Quinton de Kock replacing the
experienced Faf du Plessis as captain in T20Is.

"It's also an opportunity to start building for the future. We know
where Faf stands, as a captain and as a player. He's done great things
for South African cricket. We also need to look at what the future looks
like. We believe in Quinton, who's going to be leading the team in this
series," Nkwe, the coach-cum-manager, said during his first press meet
in Dharamsala.

"The T20 series gives us the last chance to have a look at our
leadership and batting options as the next edition of the T20 World Cup
is now little more than a year away, which is why we have gone with an
inexperienced leadership group," Corrie van Zyl, CSA's acting director
of cricket, had said before the team's departure.

For de Kock, who came into the limelight with three successive ODI tons
against India at home in 2013, his promotion to the captain's post is a
gradual progression of a player who was primed to be major force in the
South African line-up. At the World Cup, he was one of the three South
African batsmen, along with du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen, to
tally more than 300 runs and yet it was his failure to convert his
starts into big scores that ended up hurting them.

"Coming into this series, we've got a lot of new players. Win or lose, I
just want the guys to keep competing, keep fighting. As long as they
keep doing that, I'm sure we'll be in good hands," said de Kock. "We've
got quite a young team, so there will be a lot of energy. I'm looking
forward to that." Of course he is, given he struck two centuries and 318
runs the last time South Africa played an ODI series in India, back in
2015-16.

Not everyone who failed in England and Wales has been ignored. The South
Africans have included eight players from the World Cup squad in the
14-man T20 unit for the India tour. Seven of those eight are returning
from a period away from cricket, while only Beuran Hendricks featured in
an A-series.

Aiden Markram and Lungi Ngidi, both of whom starred in the Test series
when India toured South Africa in 2018, will feature in the long-format
leg of this tour, starting in Visakhapatnam early next month.

The squad features four T20 debutants in batsman Temba Bavuma, left-arm
spinner Bjorn Fortuin, all-rounder George Linde and fast bowler Anrich
Nortje. All four were part of the South Africa A side that played in the
recently-concluded one-day series against India A. Three other members
from that A side are in the T20 side.

And it is not only the T20s that will see players earning international
caps. The Test squad has a possible debutant in Nortje, wicketkeeper
Rudi Second and spinning all-rounder Senuran Muthusamy.

New Delhi: Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP from
Punjab Raghav Chadha hit out at the BJP government over its demand for
Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2022-2023 in the Parliament. He
said that he wishes that this facility was also available for the common
man of the country, who are reeling under incessantly rising inflation,
especially every end of the month.During his address in the Rajya Sabha
on Monday, MP Raghav Chadha said that there could be only two reasons
for demanding extra money from the proposed budget. First that, at the
beginning of the first financial year, the government presented its
budget by estimating less than what it wanted to achieve, in an attempt
to mislead the public by beautifying the fiscal deficit. Or the second
reason could be that the government has completely failed to manage its
budget.Raghav Chadha said that the discussion should be held on the
government's demand for additional budget in the House and two other
important issues should also be discussed. First, where and how was the
Rs 40 lakh crore spent by the government at the beginning of the
financial year and what did the country get from it in particular?

Because all the current economic indicators of India are only ringing
the alarm bell. Secondly, it also laid the foundation of the budget for
the financial year 2023-24 to be presented 2-3 months from today.Chadha
proposed to discuss the budget twice before the HouseAAP leader Raghav
Chadha gave an important suggestion to the House and said that "the
discussion on the budget should be held twice. One is when the budget is
presented and the other is during the winter session 7-8 months after
the presentation of the budget so that the House and the people of the
country can know what the country has achieved by spending the budget
presented. How many jobs did you get? What is the unemployment rate?
What is inflation rate?"India's economy is in shamble, the parliament
and the government need to look into it before sanctioning the surplus
money: Raghav ChadhaChadha said that today the government has come to
the House to demand Rs 3,25,757 crore. But before that, the attention of
the House and the Finance Minister was drawn to the 8 major economic
problems which he said are the eight diseases from which India's economy
is suffering today.Raghav Chadha coins new slogan for BJP and says, 'Har
Ghar Berozgar, Jehi hai Bhajpa Sarkar'Raghav Chadha stressed that the
biggest problem before the country's economy is unemployment, which rate
is the highest in the last 45 years. He said that the BJP government had
promised to provide 2 crore jobs every year, jobs were not given, but
the central government has definitely broken all records in the
unemployment rate.When this government came to power in 2014, the
unemployment rate was 4.9%, which has increased to 8% today and it is
only the organized unemployment rate. The government received 22 crore
applications for jobs and only 7 lakh jobs were given. Today, the
unemployment rate of the country which we used to take pride in calling
a young country has become a burden on the same youth. Taking a dig at
the BJP, he said that the party's new slogan should be 'Har Ghar
Berozgar, Jehi hai Bhajpa Sarkar'.Considering incessantly rising rate of
inflation, today the country does not need 'Aadhaar card' but a 'Udhaar
card': Raghav ChadhaTaking another swipe at centre government over
inflation, he said that today the country is not in need of 'Aadhaar
card' but it needs a 'Udaar card'. He said that the country is
struggling with incessantly rising inflation that the government imposes
on the people without bringing a law. Inflation is at its highest level
in the last 30 years. The wholesale inflation rate is 12-15% and retail
is 6-8%. Chadha said that the promise to the people of the country was
to increase income, but the increase in the last eight years is only
inflation. The government is making every countryman poor.Compared to
2014, petrol price hiked from Rs 55 to Rs 100 per liter, diesel from Rs
45 to Rs 90 per liter, milk from Rs 30 per liter to Rs 60 per liter,
cylinder has increased from Rs 400 to Rs 1100. "The Finance Minister
does not eat onions, but she must have eaten flour, dal, rice and cheese
and she must know that today the rate of fertilizer inflation in the
country is 10-17% which has worsened the economic condition of the
common man as India's per capita income has come down by Rs 9,160 under
the BJP government," he said.Considering incessantly rising inflation,
today the country does not need 'Aadhaar card' but an 'Udhaar card':
Raghav ChadhaChadha also questioned the government's failed policies for
economic reforms, saying the growth rate, which was 13.5 per cent in the
first quarter of the financial year, has come down to just 6.3 per cent
in the second quarter, which is the festive season. During the fourth
quarter i.e. the next budget, it will fall further to 5%, which has
never happened before. The government is talking about a growth rate of
8% for the next financial year, but every data, including the World Bank
and IMF, indicates that the growth rate will remain in the between of
5-6 percent. Chadha takes dig at BJP and says, 'You don't even give free
rewari, then where did the loan money of Rs 85 lakh crore
vanished'?Chadha said that debt is the next big problem because India
took a loan of Rs 55 lakh crore in 66 years from 1947-2014, but the BJP
government took a loan of Rs 85 lakh crore in eight years from
2014-2022. "They don't even distribute 'free rewari', then where is all
this money going?Farmers may be naive, but they don't forget anything,
according to 2021-22 figures, 30 farmers commit suicide every day, the
government has money to waive debt of capitalists, not for 'annadatas':
Raghav ChadhaRaising the issue of farmers, the AAP MP said, "It is like
a disease for our economy that the loans of capitalists are being waived
off, while in the last eight years, the debt burden on farmers has
increased by 53%." Today, every farmer has an average debt of Rs 75,000
and when poor farmers are unable to repay the loan, they are humiliated,
but the government is transporting rich corporate friends to foreign in
business class, those have looted crores of taxpayers money. He said
that the country's farmers are forced to consume poison, in the year
2021-22, 10,851 farmers committed suicide, that is, every day 30 farmers
die due to ill-conceived economic policies of the government. Reminding
the BJP government about over a year-long farmers' agitation and the
farmers who were martyred, he said that the farmer can be naive, but
they don't forget anything.BJP govt should answer why private sector
investment declines despite reduction in corporate taxes and loan
waivers of capitalists: Raghav ChadhaChadha also hit out at the BJP
government over the declining investment in the private sector and said
the government took two steps for the corporate sector. The corporate
tax has been reduced from 30 to 22 per cent, which is also causing a
loss of Rs 1.5 lakh crore to the government every year and secondly, the
BJP government has waived the debt of Rs 10 lakh crore of capitalists in
the last five years.The government had argued that this would increase
employment, reduce inflation, but every fact is telling that what
happened is the exact opposite. Inflation and unemployment rates are
skyrocketing and investment in the private sector also registered a
sharp decline. In the first quarter, there was a decline of 20% and
foreign investment declined by 59%. At the same time, the GFCF has also
been declining steadily since 2019-20. Chadha said the finance minister
needs to understand that investment does not come from giving
concessions but from increasing demand.The value of the rupee is falling
and the exports is also a matter of concern, the failure rate of new
startups is also worrisome: Raghav ChadhaExpressing concern over the
continuously falling value of the rupee, he said that earlier the big
leaders of the BJP used to say that the country's reputation falls due
to the fall of the rupee, but now the reputation, prestige and rupee
have all come down to the low level. "What is surprising is that despite
the fall in the rupee, exports are also falling, which is not usually
the case," he said. The failure rate of new startups is very high which
is the eighth big challenge for the economy. Less than 10% of new
startups are able to complete 5 years and all the big startups have
consistently reduced, due to which the unemployment rate continued to
increase.BJP doesn't even distribute 'free rewari', then why is there a
need for an additional budget for subsidies: Raghav ChadhaWhen we
provide free electricity, water, education and health facilities in
Delhi, this government says Arvind Kejriwal is distributing 'free
rewari': ChadhaChadha added that now the government has demanded
additional subsidy for budget. When we provide free electricity, water,
education and health facilities in Delhi, this government says Arvind
Kejriwal is distributing 'free rewari'. Giving subsidy and facilities by
the Aam Aadmi Party government is 'free rewari'.He said the MP gets 34
air travel, free water, 50,000 litres of petrol per year free of cost,
but when the same facilities were given to the common man, these people
call it 'Rewari'. He said that 40 developed countries of the world
provide free electricity, water, education and health facilities and
today they are developed countries for this reason. AAP leader Raghav
Chadha launches scathing attack on BJP over additional budget for new ED
officeIn the demand for additional budget to complete the grants, the
central government has asked for Rs 30 crore land for the new office of
the ED, etc. "This is the BJP's most utilised department as they had
lodged many opposition leaders and ministers, therefore, why should the
government keep a budget of only Rs 30 crore rather it should be 30 lakh
crores? ED police stations should be opened in every street
mohalla."Raghav Chadha asks 10 important questions related to the Indian
economy from BJP government and finance ministerAfter this, Raghav
Chadha dared the centre government and union finance minister to answer
ten questions related to economy. He first asked that, "does the Hon'ble
Finance Minister know the rate of 1 kg flour and 1 litre of milk?
Secondly, why did the BJP's mega budget of 2022 fail to provide
employment? Thirdly, why are the goods produced in India so expensive
and out of the common man's budget? Fourth, despite concessions to the
corporate sector, why is investment not coming in the private sector?
Fifth, how many jobs were created by the capitalists' debt waivers and
tax reduction? Sixth, why the sharp decline and failure of the new
economy i.e. the startup economy? Seventh, how much will rupee take to
regain its value? Is the government waiting for hundreds of rupees
against the dollar? Eighth, why the decline in exports? Ninth, what is
the meaning of inflation being higher than the growth rate? Inform the
house and people of the country that, when will the tax burden from the
common man come down?"
