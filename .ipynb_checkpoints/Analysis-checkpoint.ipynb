      "Therefore, perhaps for anyone concerned about increasing the probability of survival and viability of a new business, these observations would suggest that proper support in terms of skills-building and development or having a mentor to guide entrepreneurs through the initial drudgery phase of the start-up becomes of utmost importance.As an aspiring business leader, you'd often find yourself in situations where you might not know what to do next or how to revive your moxie from a mistake that could cost you your entire business.In times like these, an expert, a savvy guide, or perhaps a mentor can help you chart an alternate strategy, help you pick yourself up and get back in the game or even stop you from making fatal mistakes or actions that warrant tremendous flak.Simply put, challenges at every step are a part and parcel of entrepreneurship and having a good mentor will always help you tide over obstacles by turning bad decisions into good plans and will imbibe you with the confidence to move relentlessly towards stipulated objectives.Some of the factors that bog down budding entrepreneurs that often compel them to forfeit their ventures are the following:* Fear of failure* Limited access to capital* Weak institutional support* Lack of experience to tackle problems* Limited knowledge and informationArmed with the support of a good mentorship programme, budding entrepreneurs can not only increase their entrepreneurial awareness but can also gain access to correct variant of exposure, visibility and talent that would further enhance their skills and improve their entrepreneurial esprit de corps.What is entrepreneurial mentoring?Entrepreneurial mentoring involves a relatively experienced entrepreneur acting as a sagacious 'critical friend' or 'guide', helping to oversee the career and development of a novice entrepreneur who is inexperienced when it comes to dabbling with various facets simultaneously.Each party brings different perspectives and knowledge, and in many cases, mentees will establish the goals of the relationship.Entrepreneurial mentoring can be viewed as a business development process for owners/managers.\n",

In 2005, Forbes published a survey that gauged the success rate of startups, and one very startling revelation was made: 90% of all startups will fail eventually.This caused ripples across the startup, SME world, and the investors, entrepreneurs started digging deep into the ecosystem and attempting to find the reason for this alarming failure rate.In our experience at TechAhead, one of the biggest reasons for such a high failure rate among startups and SMEs is the lack of vision for the future.We have observed how brilliant ideas fail to take off because the founders failed to gauge the massive change in consumer behavior, the onslaught of newer, sharper technologies, and ignored the tech innovations that their users desperately wanted.We at TechAhead are on a mission to change this, forever.TechAhead Empowering Startups, SMEs With Digital TransformationIn the last 12 years of our glorious history, we have unleashed a tsunami of digital transformation for startups, SMEs, enterprises, Forbes 500 companies, and more, and our stunning success rate is the evidence of our disruptive tech innovation.At our IT outsourcing company[1], we have a relentless focus on creating

Award-winning design experience for the end-users, and established our clients firmly on the various app stores.We treat design as a revolution, and this is our USP and specialty.Powerhouse of

      "2020 has been another outstanding year for books on the startup movement, with more of a focus on co-creation, inner dialogues, and business model designs - reflecting the growing maturity of the startup ecosystem around the world.See our earlier lists of 'Top 10 Books for Entrepreneurs' from the past eight years as well: 2019,2018,2017,2016,2015,2014,2013, and2012.YourStory has also published the pocketbook Proverbs and Quotes for Entrepreneurs: A World of Inspiration for Startupsas a creative and motivational guide for innovators, accessible as apps (Apple; free Android version).Undoubtedly and unfortunately, the biggest development of the year 2020 was the coronavirus pandemic - with triple shock effects in health, economic, and social spheres.\n",
