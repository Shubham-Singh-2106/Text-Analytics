# Text-Analytics

## Designed and implemented a text analytics pipeline to extract insights from large volumes of LexisNexis online news and legal articles.

## Performed data ingestion, cleansing, and preprocessing, including stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and entity standardization.

## Utilized NLP techniques such as topic modeling (LDA), and sentiment analysis to identify key entities, themes, and trends.

## Applied TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec/BERT), and clustering algorithms to analyze article relevance, content similarity, and hidden patterns.

## Created visual dashboards and summary reports to present findings to stakeholders, aiding in strategic decision-making and media monitoring.

## Ensured compliance with data handling protocols and LexisNexis usage policies.
